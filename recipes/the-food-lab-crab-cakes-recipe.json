Using a flexible spatula, fold gently until combined, being careful not to break up any large lumps of crab.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nOn a work surface, place a 12- by 18-inch sheet of aluminum foil with the short end parallel to the edge of the surface. Transfer crab mixture to foil, about 4 inches from bottom of foil, and form into a rough log about 6 inches wide.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nCarefully lift bottom edge of foil and lift it over the crab log. Roll the log away from you until it is completely wrapped in foil, then twist the ends to form a tight roll about 6- to 8-inches wide and 3- to 4-inches in diameter. Place log on a tray or plate and transfer to the freezer until lightly stiff, 20 to 25 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nRemove the log from the freezer and using a sharp chef's knife, slice off one of the twisted ends. Remove crab mixture from inside twisted end and reserve. Slice log into 4 or 6 individual disks, about 1 1/2-inch thick each. Transfer disks (with their foil) to a rimmed baking sheet cut-side down. Combine any crab mixture removed from twisted ends and form into a free-form crab cake and place on tray along with foil-wrapped disks. Transfer to freezer until disks are relatively stiff, about 20 to 25 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nIn a small bowl, beat remaining egg until homogenous. In a second small bowl, place bread crumbs. Working one crab disk at a time, lift by grasping the foil-lined edges. Dip one cut surface in egg, then in bread crumbs, pressing down gently to adhere. Return to baking sheet, cut side down and repeat with remaining disks (including free-form disk).\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nAdjust oven rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to high. In a large cast iron skillet, heat oil and butter over medium heat until foaming subsides. Add crab cakes, breaded side down and cook, swirling occasionally, for 3 minutes. Carefully peel off foil from each cake using your fingertips, without lifting the cakes; discard foil. Continue cooking, swirling pan occasionally until underside of crab cakes is light golden brown, about 2 minutes longer (check underneath with a thin flexible metal spatula, but be careful not to break crab cakes, they will be fragile).\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nGrasp the handle of the pan and tilt it towards you so the fat collects in the bottom. Use a spoon to baste each cake with fat, making sure that it is completely coated, then transfer skillet to broiler. Broil until light golden brown on top and crab cakes are cooked through (an instant-read thermometer inserted into their center should register 145 to 160\u00b0F or 63 to 71\u00b0C), about 5 minutes. Remove from oven. Transfer crab cakes breaded-side-down to a paper towel-lined plate. Flip crab cakes and season with salt. Serve immediately with tartar sauce or lemon wedges.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nRead More\nExtra Tangy Tartar Sauce\nCrab\nAmerican\nStovetop Seafood\nSeafood Mains\nSnacks & Appetizers",
