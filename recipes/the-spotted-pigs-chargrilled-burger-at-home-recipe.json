Combine well-chilled meat in large bowl and grind, passing through grinder twice, re-chilling grinder and meat in between grinds if necessary (i.e. if fat starts to smear).\nIf Using A Food Processor:\nSpread meat on sheet tray and place in freezer until firm and just starting to freeze, but still malleable, about 15 minutes. Working in four batches, grind meat in 12-cup food processor, processing with 8-10 one-second pulses, redistributing meat between pulses as necessary. Transfer batches to large bowl and combine.\nForm meat into four patties, about 4 1/2 inches wide and 1 inch tall, making slight depression in center of each patty.\nLight large chimney starter filled with charcoal (5-6 quarts, about 100 briquettes), and burn until coals are coated in thin layer of gray ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals and spread evenly over half of grates. Position grill grate on top of grill, cover grill, and heat until grate is hot, about 5 minutes. Scrub grill clean with grill brush if necessary. Season burger patties generously with salt and pepper on all sides. Place on hot side of grill and cook for 1 minute. Flip burgers and cook for 1 minute longer. Flip burgers again, adjusting as necessary to create cross-hatched grill pattern on first side. Cook for 1 minute longer. Flip once more, adjusting as necessary to create cross-hatched grill pattern on second side and cook for 1 minute longer. Transfer burgers to cool side of grill, cover, and cook until desired temperature is achieved, about 1 minute for rare (120\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer), or 2 1/2 minutes for medium (140\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer). Transfer burgers to cutting board, top each with 2 ounces Roquefort cheese, tent loosely with foil, and allow to rest 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cut buns in half. Toast cut sides on hot side of grill, pressing down gently, until golden-brown grill marks are formed, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer bun bottoms to cool side of grill to keep warm. Toast top sides of top buns over hot side of grilled, pressing buns into grill grates to form cross-hatched grill pattern about 1 minute total. Place burgers on bun bottoms, top with bun tops, and serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nmeat grinder or food processor\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Burger Lab: Recreating the Spotted Pig's Chargrilled Burger at Home\nSerious Entertaining: A Father's Day Menu For The Whole Family\nBurgers\nGrilled Beef\nGround Beef\nQuick Dinners",
