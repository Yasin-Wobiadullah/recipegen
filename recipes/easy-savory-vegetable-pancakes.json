Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nFor the Pancakes\n: In a large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour (or other flour), 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and baking powder until well-combined, about 30 seconds. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nIn a separate medium bowl, whisk together egg, doubanjiang (or other fermented bean paste), garlic, and water until mixture is homogeneous, about 1 minute. Add wet mixture to large mixing bowl with flour mixture and whisk together just until a smooth, loose batter forms; the consistency should be similar to pancake batter; it should flow easily off the whisk and puddle briefly on top of the batter in the bowl. Add additional ice-cold water as needed to achieve this consistency, taking care not to over-mix the batter.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nAdd salted cabbage (or kimchi), grated carrot, and sliced scallions to batter and, using flexible spatula, fold in vegetables gently until evenly incorporated.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nHeat oil in 12-inch stainless steel, well-seasoned cast iron, or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Using a large spoon, small ladle, or measuring cup, add batter in 3-tablespoon (1 1/2-ounce; 45ml) portions (you can make larger or smaller pancakes as desired) to hot oil. For thinner, crispier pancakes, press down on batter to flatten them out; for thicker, fluffier pancakes, leave batter undisturbed. Cook, swirling oil once or twice, until pancakes are golden brown and crispy on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and continue cooking, swirling oil once or twice, until second side is golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer pancakes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet or paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Repeat process with remaining batter, adding more oil if pan becomes too dry. Serve pancakes hot with dipping sauce alongside.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk\n,\ndigital scale\n, 12-inch\nstainless steel\nor\ncast iron\nskillet\nNotes\nTo prepare salted raw cabbage, core and roughly chop 1/4 head green cabbage, and combine with 2 teaspoons salt in a medium mixing bowl. Using clean hands, toss and massage cabbage with salt to thoroughly combine. Set aside for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Firmly squeeze cabbage in batches to get rid of excess water. Set macerated cabbage aside and discard expressed water.\nThis recipe was tested with rice flour, roasted rice flour, chickpea flour, and several varieties of whole wheat flour.\nThe amount of water needed to form a pancake-batter consistency depends on the type of alternative flour used. The 160 milliliters of ice water called for should be seen as a suggested starting point; for rice flour, you may not need to add any additional water, but for other flours, like whole wheat, depending on how finely they're milled, you may need to add additional ice water to achieve the proper consistency.\nThe vegetables in the recipe can be replaced, either in part or entirely, with an equivalent amount of stir-fried vegetables, leftover chopped, cooked meats, or with small pieces of raw quick-cooking proteins, like shrimp.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPancakes are best served and enjoyed immediately.\nVegetable Sides\nCabbage\nCarrots"
