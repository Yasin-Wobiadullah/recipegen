Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, toasted sugar, cream of tartar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and solid coconut oil in the bowl of a food processor. Process until oil virtually disappears into a fine, floury meal. Add water and pulse to form a damp and crumbly dough. Turn onto an unfloured surface and knead into a ball.\nRoll and Bake the Biscuits:\nOn a generously floured surface, roll dough until just shy of 1/4 inch (4.7mm), using as much flour as needed along the way to prevent sticking. Dust away excess flour with a pastry brush and decorate with a docking tool if you like. Cut into 2 3/4\u2013inch rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Gather up scraps, knead, roll, and cut as before.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake until firm and dry to the touch but quite pale, about 22 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pan and continue with next step, or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.\nTemper the Chocolate:\nTemper chocolate according to one of the methods described\nhere\n.\nCoat the Biscuits:\nWorking with just 2 or 3 biscuits at a time, dollop a generous 1/2 tablespoon, or just over 1/4 ounce, chocolate over each. Spread into an even layer over biscuit and, as chocolate starts to thicken, bounce the tines of a fork across the surface to create a wavy pattern. Repeat with remaining biscuits and chocolate. (Before it hardens, store excess chocolate according to the directions\nhere\n.) Serve biscuits immediately, preferably with hot tea, and transfer to an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor fitted with a metal blade, half sheet pan, rolling pin, pastry brush, docking tool (optional), 2 3/4\u2013inch round cutter or wine glass\nNotes\nIf you want dark chocolate, Theo 70% is a solid vegan offering. Or, try the coconut milk chocolate from Charm School Chocolate for something mellower.\nRead More\nVegan Chocolate Chip Cookies\nVegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies\nScottish\nDairy-free\nVegan Desserts\nBaking\nChocolate",
