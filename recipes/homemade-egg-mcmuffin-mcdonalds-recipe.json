Cook, swirling muffin halves and pressing gently to get good contact with pan, until both pieces are well browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a sheet of aluminum foil, split side up.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nMelt remaining 1 teaspoon butter in the now empty skillet and increase heat to medium-high. Add bacon and cook, turning frequently, until browned and crisp around the edges, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer bacon to lower muffin half.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nPlace the lid of a quart-sized, wide-mouthed Mason jar (both the lid and the sealing ring) upside down in the now empty skillet. (The side the jar screws onto should be facing up.) Spray the inside with nonstick cooking spray and break the egg into it. Poke the egg yolk with a fork to break it and season with salt and pepper. Pour 3/4 cup (180ml) water into the skillet, cover, and cook until the egg is set, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nUsing a thin spatula, transfer Mason jar lid to a paper towel\u2013lined plate. Pour excess water out of the skillet, carefully wipe dry and return it to the stovetop with the heat off. Flip Mason jar lid over and gently remove it to release egg (you may need to use a thin spatula or butter knife to help coax egg off lid). Place egg on top of bacon and top with cheese slice. Close sandwich, wrap in aluminum foil, and return to now empty skillet. Let it warm up in the skillet for 2 minutes with the heat off, flipping occasionally. Unwrap and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch nonstick or\ncast iron skillet\n; lid from a wide-mouthed, quart-size Mason jar\nBreakfast Sandwich\nFried Eggs\nBacon\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
