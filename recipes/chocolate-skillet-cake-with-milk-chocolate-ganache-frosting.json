In a 10-inch cast iron skillet, bring cream to a simmer over medium heat. When bubbling hard around the edges, pour over milk chocolate in bowl. Whisk by hand until smooth, stir in salt to taste, and set aside until no longer steaming, about 15 minutes, then cover and refrigerate until needed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Cake:\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Combine butter and coffee or tea in the same 10-inch cast iron skillet as before (no need to wash or rinse). Warm over low heat until butter has melted, then remove from heat. Mix in cocoa and dark chocolate, followed by brown sugar, vanilla, and salt. Working gently to avoid splashes, whisk in eggs, followed by flour and baking soda. Continue whisking until smooth and well combined.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPlace skillet in oven and bake until cake is firm, though your finger will still leave an impression in the puffy crust, about 30 minutes. The timing will vary depending on the skillet's gauge, but a toothpick inserted into the center should come away with a few crumbs still attached. Cool cake in skillet until no trace of warmth remains, about 1 1/2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Finish:\nVigorously stir milk chocolate ganache with a flexible spatula until it begins to thicken to a yogurt-like consistency that's a little looser than a buttercream. Scrape over the cooled cake and sculpt into swoops and swirls, using a small spoon or offset spatula. Enjoy immediately or leave at room temperature until ready to serve, up to 24 hours at cool room temperature. After cutting, wrap leftover slices individually and store at cool room temperature up to 2 days more.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch cast iron skillet\n,\nsilicone ball whisk\n(optional)\nNotes\nThis cake cannot be made with natural cocoa, so pick up a Dutch style, like Droste or Divine at the supermarket, or shop for brands like Cacao Barry Extra Brute in bulk online.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBefore cutting, this cake may be kept up to 24 hours at cool room temperature. After cutting, wrap leftover slices individually and store at cool room temperature up to 2 days more.\nRead More\nA Guide to Cake Frosting\nHummingbird Skillet Cake\n30-Minute Skillet Plum Cake\nPumpkin Skillet Coffee Cake With Streusel Topping\nCakes\nSheet Cake\nChocolate\nMother's Day\nFather's Day",
