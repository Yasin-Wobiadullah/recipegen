Lightly grease one 9- by 4-inch aluminum Pullman loaf pan with neutral oil and line with parchment cross-wise so that there is a 1-inch overhang on both sides. (See notes below if you do not have a Pullman loaf pan.)\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a large bowl, whisk eggs, oil, sugar, salt, and coffee to combine. Using a fine-mesh sieve, sift flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder into egg mixture. Whisk until combined. Whisk in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche until smooth and no streaks remain. Using a flexible spatula, scrape mixture into the prepared pan.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nBake until the cake is just set and a skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. The cake will feel just barely set and very tender. Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then run an offset spatula or butter knife around the edges to loosen. Gently lift parchment to remove cake from pan, then transfer to a wire rack. Pull parchment to remove and allow cake to cool completely, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nFor the Frosting:\nIn a small bowl, whisk 1/2 teaspoon powdered gelatin with 1 1/2 tablespoons water. Let sit until gelatin has bloomed, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a medium saucepan, whisk cornstarch, granulated sugar, and salt to combine. Add water, bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until mixture just begins to thicken and gel, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, then whisk in gelatin and chocolate, stirring constantly until gelatin and chocolate have melted and mixture is smooth, 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nUsing a fine-mesh sieve, strain chocolate mixture into a medium bowl. Press plastic wrap against surface and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. (It should be warm and pourable, but should no longer be steaming hot.)\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nTo Assemble:\nSet cake on cutting board and, using a serrated knife, carefully remove top of cake to level it; set scraps aside for snacking or another use. Slice cake into 2 even layers. Place bottom of the cake back onto the wire rack set inside the rimmed baking sheet and top with 1/3 of the frosting, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Top with\nsecond layer of cake\n. Using an offset spatula, spread remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake, letting excess drip off beneath onto wire rack.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nLet cake sit on wire rack until frosting is set and does not leave any trace on your fingertips, about 30 minutes. Using a sharp chef\u2019s knife, slice cake and serve. (For cleaner cuts, run knife under warm water and dry knife with a clean kitchen towel before portioning each slice.)\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 4-inch aluminum Pullman loaf pan; fine-mesh sieve, serrated knife, wire rack\nNotes\nThis recipe was developed using a 9- by 4-inch Pullman loaf pan. If you don\u2019t have a Pullman loaf pan, you can use a regular 9- by 4-inch loaf pan, however, because a regular loaf pan is shorter, you\u2019ll have to remove 1/2 cup of the cake batter before baking to prevent the cake from spilling over as it bakes. You can place the remaining cake batter in a greased ramekin and bake until just firm to the touch, 15 to 20 minutes.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe cooled, unfrosted cake can be made up to 1 day in advance.\nThe frosting must be used immediately after it\u2019s made, as the gelatin will set as the frosting cools and make it impossible to spread, but the frosted cake can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days or kept at room temperature for up to 1 day.\nChocolate\nThe Latest\nSoutheast Asian\nCakes\nDesserts",
