Whisk flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Toss cheddar with dry ingredients until well combined. Stir in cream, mixing with a flexible spatula until dough comes together. Transfer to a lightly floured surface, knead until pliable and smooth, then divide in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a roughly 15- by 11-inch rectangle, no more than 1/8-inch thick. Transfer each to a parchment-lined half sheet pan, then cut into 1-inch squares using a fluted pastry wheel.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Egg Wash:\nWhisk egg, yolk, water, and salt together in a small bowl. Brush over prepared dough, then sprinkle with additional salt to taste. Using a bamboo skewer or chopstick, press a small indentation into the center of each dough square. (This is strictly for a Cheez-It look and is therefore optional.) Bake until golden brown, about 24 minutes. Cool to room temperature and enjoy immediately, or store up to 1 month in an airtight container at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nParmesan grater or\nMicroplane\n, 2\nhalf sheet pans\n,\nrolling pin\n,\nfluted pastry wheel\n, pastry brush, bamboo skewer or chopstick\nNotes\nThis recipe works well with sharp yellow cheddars, like Tillamook and Cabot, but if you're looking for a change of pace, Manchego works well, too. Use a fine, Parmesan-style grater for the cheese. I love Microplane's fine grater because it's extra wide, making quick work of the cheese.\nRead More\nThick and Creamy Tomato Soup\nPumpkin Cheddar Crackers\nSnacks & Appetizers\nCheddar Cheese"
