(This may be done up to an hour ahead).\nPreheat a large skillet over high heat; add the oil and heat briefly. Add the garlic and rosemary to the pan and stir to lightly brown garlic, watching carefully to prevent burning.\nAdd the shrimp, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and lemon juice and quarters. Lightly stir the shrimp and the ingredients, just enough to mix.\nPour in the beer, stirring to release any bits clinging to the bottom of the skillet, and boil the mixture to reduce while shaking the pan. Cook shrimp 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, depending on size, and add remaining seafood seasoning and salt and pepper to taste. When shrimp are finished cooking, the liquid should have a sauce consistency.\nQuickly whisk in the butter, turning the heat down as necessary, until it is melted into the sauce, leaving it thick and emulsified. Taste and add salt and pepper if desired. Remove lemon quarters. Serve with crusty bread, lots of napkins, and fingerbowls. Garnish each serving with a lemon piece.\nShrimp\nCajun & Creole\nStovetop Seafood\nSeafood Mains\nQuick Dinners"
