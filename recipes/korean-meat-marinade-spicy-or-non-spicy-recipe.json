If making non-spicy version, omit chili pepper powder. Add meat, taking care the sauce evenly coats slices of meat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let marinate at least 2 hours and up to one day before cooking.\nTo cook: heat a cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon cooking oil or fat if skillet is not well-seasoned. Add slices of meat and let brown until the surface of meat is slightly caramelized but still tender inside, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Alternatively, broil meat for 60 seconds, taking care that meat does not scorch or cook unevenly. Eat slices of meat with lettuce leaves and accompanying sauces and seasonings.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSeriously Asian: Korean Meat Marinades\nRubs & Marinades"
