Stir to combine and set aside.\nFor the Broccoli Rabe\n: Heat olive oil in a large straight-sided skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until softened and just barely beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add broccoli rabe and white wine. Increase heat to medium high and cook, stirring occasionally until broccoli rabe is all wilted, about 3 minutes. Lower heat to medium-low and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until broccoli rabe is tender and completely olive green, about 20 minutes total (if pan becomes dry, add a few tablespoons of water to moisten). Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nTo Assemble\n: Slice each loaf of bread in half and spread a few tablespoons of olive salad on each cut face. Layer broccoli rabe, red peppers, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes on bottom half of each loaf, leaving a 1/2-inch border all around the perimeter. Close sandwiches.\nIf desired, press sandwiches on a pre-heated panini press until compressed, crisp, and hot throughout, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, wrap in plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to allow olive oil to soak into bread before serving. Cut each sandwich into quarters and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nPanini press\nSandwiches\nBroccoli Rabe"
