Add the chicken and stir to combine with the onions and spices until well coated.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdd the stock and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and tender, and the stock turns into a thick and glossy sauce that coats the chicken, 15 to 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and honey, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nMeanwhile in a small skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil until shimmering.
