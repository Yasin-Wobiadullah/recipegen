Add potato and roasted garlic, season lightly with salt and pepper and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until onion just begins to brown, about 5 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd Parmesan stock, and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender and offer little to no resistance when poked with a paring knife, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat.\nVicky Wasik\nUsing an immersion or countertop blender, blend soup until completely smooth (if using a countertop blender, blend in batches, if necessary, and start blending at low speed before increasing to high). If soup is too thick, thin as needed with additional Parmesan stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.\nVicky Wasik\nFor Serving:\nDivide soup between warmed bowls, sprinkle with basil and red pepper flakes, and serve, passing bread at the table.\nVicky Wasik\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe finished soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\nSoups\nGarlic\nVegetarian Mains\nParmesan\nThe Latest",
