Add enough water to cover jars and bring to boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes, turn off the heat and allow jars to rest in hot water. Meanwhile, put rims and lids in small saucepan and cover with water. Heat over medium heat until water is simmering; remove pan from heat and allow rims and lids to rest in hot water.\nPulse the raisins in a food processor until finely chopped, about seven one-second pulses.\nCombine the apples, apple juice, rum, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a big pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are soft and beginning to break down, about 12 to 15 minutes. Mash the apples with a potato masher or large fork to make a chunky sauce.\nRemove apple mixture from heat, add pectin, and stir until dissolved. Stir in raisins. Return pot to high heat and bring mixture to a boil. Add sugar all at once. Stir mixture constantly until it comes to a full rolling boil. Allow to boil hard for one minute, then remove pot from heat and stir in cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Skim any foam off surface of the jam with a slotted spoon.\nLadle hot jam into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe rims of jars, cover with lids, and screw bands on until just barely tight. Place jars on rack in pot and cover completely with water. Cover pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Turn off heat, uncover pot, and allow jars to rest in water for five minutes. Remove jars from pot and allow to rest undisturbed on countertop for six hours or overnight.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nPreserved: Rum Raisin Apple Pie Jam\nJams & Jellies\nBaking\nApple"
