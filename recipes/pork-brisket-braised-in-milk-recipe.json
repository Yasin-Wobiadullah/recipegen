Depending on the size of your roast, you will need about 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of salt and pepper, each. Roll and tie up roast into a cylinder. The roast will benefit from being salted and kept in the refrigerator overnight, or you can proceed with the recipe immediately.\nSerious Eats / Chichi Wang\nPreheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). In a Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of oil or lard. Add tied up roast and brown it on all sides, about 10 minutes total. 5 minutes into the browning, add chopped garlic and let it brown alongside meat.\nRemove meat from pot and pour off all but 1 teaspoon of fat. Add milk, bay leaves, lemon juice, and zest. Bring mixture to a boil. Return roast to pot, placing skin side up. Cover pot and braise in oven for 1 hour. Remove cover and braise for 30 minutes longer, or until internal temperature of roast registers around 160 (71\u00b0C) to 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C). The skin on the roast should be golden brown and crisp.\nRemove roast from pot and place it into a saut\u00e9 pan or hotel pan. Place roast under broiler for 30 seconds to 1 minute, to further crisp up skin.\nIn the meantime, reduce sauce: Take braising milk in pot and place it on top of stove. Simmer sauce for 5 to 7 minutes, until sauce has formed light-brown curds. Remove bay leaves.\nSlice as much of the roast as you need into 1/2-inch thick slices, arrange on a platter, and spoon sauce over them. Serve immediately. Leftovers may be refrigerated and sliced cold for use in sandwiches.\nPork Shoulder\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork Mains"
