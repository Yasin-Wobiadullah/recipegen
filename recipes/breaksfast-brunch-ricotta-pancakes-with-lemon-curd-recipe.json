In another slightly larger bowl, stir together the ricotta, milk, egg yolks, and vanilla.\nBeat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. An electric hand mixer will save loads of time. Dump the flour mixture atop the ricotta mixture. Stir until just combined. Gently fold in the egg whites.\nHeat a griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. Wipe surface with butter, and then scoop out about 1/3 cup of the mixture for each pancake. Cook until well-browned on each side, about 2 to 3 minutes a side.\nSpread some of the lemon curd on the pancakes, and sprinkle on some powdered sugar.\nFor the lemon curd:\nWhisk together the yolks, lemon zest, lemon juice, and sugar in a saucepan. Turn the heat to medium, and stir constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.\nTurn off the heat, and stir in the butter one piece at a time, until all of it is incorporated and the mixture is very smooth. Cover mixture and stash in the fridge while you make the pancakes.\nPancakes",
