Cook those for 20 minutes as well.\nAfter the onions are well caramelized, sprinkle the flour on top and cook for another minute. Then add a splash of red wine. When that has evaporated, add the chicken or beef stock. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nWhen the sausages are done, remove them from the water and dry with some paper towels.
