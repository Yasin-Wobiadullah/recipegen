Remove from heat and let cool.\nWhile syrup is cooling, strain freshly squeezed lemon and lime juice into a resealable bottle, discarding the pulp. Pour in the cooled simple syrup. Shake and use immediately or refrigerate.\nSpecial Equipment\nJuicer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nIf you'd like to use oranges, grapefruits, or agave nectar, keep in mind they are sweeter than the ingredients in this recipe so you'll have to adjust the quantities to taste. Store mixture in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks. You can tell it's turning if it starts to get cloudy. Adding a little vodka will allow you to keep it a month, but it won't taste as fresh after a long storage.\nCocktails\nLemon\nLime"
