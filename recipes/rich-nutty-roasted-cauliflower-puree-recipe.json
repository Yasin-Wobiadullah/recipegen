Place cauliflower on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, toss with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast, flipping cauliflower with a thin metal spatula halfway through roasting, until cauliflower is tender and deeply browned on both sides, about 20 minutes total.\nIn a large saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and cayenne and cook, stirring often, until softened and just starting to turn golden, about 4 minutes.\nAdd cauliflower, cream and/or stock, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, then cook, adjusting heat to maintain simmer, until cauliflower has softened in the liquid, about 5 minutes. Discard thyme sprig.\nUsing a blender or immersion blender, blend cauliflower and liquid to form a very smooth pur\u00e9e. Season with salt and pepper. (You can adjust pur\u00e9e consistency as needed: Thicken by cooking down further while stirring often over low heat in a wide nonstick skillet, or thin by adding liquid, such as stock, cream, or water.) Serve warm.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nor\nimmersion blender\n, rimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nCream makes the most luxurious pur\u00e9e, while chicken stock adds a rich depth of flavor. You can use either or combine the two to get the best of both worlds. In a pinch, you can also use water.\nRead More\nSmooth and Silky Cauliflower Pur\u00e9e\nVegetable Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nRoasted Vegetables\nCauliflower"
