Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, roast poblano and cubanelle peppers by placing them directly over the flame of a gas stove until deeply charred on all surfaces, about 10 minutes total. If you don't have a gas burner, you can achieve similar results under the broiler, or on an outdoor grill. Place peppers in a bowl and cover with a large plate. Let steam for 5 minutes, then peel under cool running water. Dry chiles, discard seeds and stems, and roughly chop. Transfer to bowl of food processor.\nPreheat broiler to high. Toss tomatillos, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet lined with foil. Broil until charred, blistered, and just softened, turning once halfway through cooking, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to the food processor along with any exuded liquid.\nAdd half of the cilantro to the food processor and pulse mixture until it is roughly pureed but not smooth, about 8 to 10 one-second pulses. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large Dutch oven over high heat until smoking. Add half of pork and cook without moving until well browned, about 3 minutes. Stir pot and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 7 minutes. Add remaining pork and onions and cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until onions are softened, about 4 minutes. Add cumin and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nAdd chicken stock and pur\u00e9ed chiles to pot and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven, leaving lid slightly ajar. Cook until sauce is thickened and pork shreds easily with a fork, about 3 hours. Remove from oven and return to stovetop.\nSkim off and discard any excess fat. Adjust to desired consistency by adding water or boiling and reducing. Stir in remaining cilantro and season to taste with more salt. Serve immediately with warm tortillas, diced onions, sour cream, cheese, cilantro, and lime wedges.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nChili can be chilled and stored in airtight container in refrigerator for up to 5 days. Flavor will improve with time.\nRead More\nThese 4 Mexican Braises Will Jump-Start Your Fall\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork Shoulder\nPoblano Peppers\nPork Mains"
