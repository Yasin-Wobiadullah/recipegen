To unmold, follow your popsicle mold's instructions.\nSpecial equipment\nBlender\n,\n3-ounce popsicle molds\nNotes\nThis recipe is formulated to make six 3-ounce popsicles, but you can scale it up or down as needed to accommodate popsicle molds of different sizes and numbers.\nYou can read about\nour favorite popsicle molds right here\n.\nTo determine if fresh mangos are ripe, focus on their smell and feel. They should be extremely fragrant with skin that at the very least gives a little when gently pressed; even better is if it's beginning to wrinkle just slightly.\nIf using frozen fruit, place the frozen mango in a medium bowl and let thaw at room temperature until slightly softened, about 30 minutes. Discard any liquid that has accumulated at the bottom of the bowl before proceeding with the recipe (this will increase the total time of the recipe).\nNot all Greek yogurts are created equal, which can make a big difference in a recipe where it\u2019s the main ingredient. Look for brands that contain nothing but milk and active cultures, such as Fage and Chobani, or try skyr instead. Steer clear of any yogurt or skyr artificially thickened with gums or pectin, as their high moisture content can alter the frozen texture.\nWe highly recommend sticking with full-fat Greek yogurt; substituting with low-fat or skim yogurts will produce icy popsicles with a harsher, more tart flavor. The same goes for heavy cream; substituting with milk of lower fat percentages will produce icy popsicles with a watered-down flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nAfter unmolding, each popsicle can be tightly wrapped in plastic and kept frozen for up to 4 weeks.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Yogurt Popsicles With Your Fruit of Choice\nPopsicles\nSummer Desserts\nMango\nGreek Yogurt\nSummer Snacks & Appetizers"
