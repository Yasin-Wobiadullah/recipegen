Add flour to the first one, beaten eggs to the second, and panko and Parmesan cheese to the third. Mix panko and Parmesan thoroughly.\nSeason both sides of chicken cutlets with salt and pepper. Working with one at a time, dredge a cutlet in flour with your left hand, shaking off excess. Transfer to egg dish, then turn cutlet with your right hand to coat both sides. Lift and allow excess egg to drain off, then transfer to bread crumb mixture. With your left hand, scoop bread crumbs on top of chicken, then gently press, turning chicken to ensure a good layer of crumbs on both sides. Transfer cutlet to a clean plate and repeat with remaining cutlets.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFill a large cast iron skillet with 1/4-inch clarified butter or frying oil. (To speed things up even more, use 2 skillets simultaneously.) Heat cooking fat over high heat until shimmering and just shy of smoking, about 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer.\nUsing tongs or your fingers, gently lower cutlets into the hot fat, laying them down away from you to prevent hot fat from splashing toward you. (Work in batches if necessary.) Fry, gently swirling pan and rotating cutlets for even browning, and adjust heat as necessary for a steady, vigorous bubble, until the bottom side of cutlet is browned and crisp,\u00a0 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Flip cutlets and fry until other side is browned and crisp, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate or baking dish and season with salt right away. Repeat with remaining cutlets. Serve immediately with\n5-minute radicchio and watercress salad\nand lemon wedges on the side, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nClarified butter will give the chicken the best possible flavor, but it requires more work and tends to be more expensive; oil is absolutely fine as a time- and cost-saving ingredient.
