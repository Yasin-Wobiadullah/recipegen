Combine pecans and powdered sugar in a 10-inch stainless steel skillet and toast in oven until fragrant but not deeply browned, 12 to 15 minutes. When pecans and sugar have cooled to room temperature, combine with flour, cold butter, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon in the bowl of a food processor. (Save the skillet for step 2.) Pulse until pecan pieces disappear, then continue pulsing to form a stiff dough.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Finish:\nSprinkle about half of powdered sugar into skillet, then divide dough into 20 half-ounce portions (I use a #60 scoop). Tumble each piece in powdered sugar until fully coated and roll into a ball. When all pieces have been rounded up, shake skillet so the cookie dough rolls around, collecting more sugar. Arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan and bake until puffed and firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature directly on sheet pan and sift remaining powdered sugar on top.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nfitted with metal blade,\n10-inch stainless steel skillet\n,\nhalf sheet pan\nNotes\nIf you don't normally enjoy the taste of powdered sugar, try making these cookies with organic powdered sugar, which has a more nuanced flavor thanks to the natural molasses content in raw cane sugar (more on that\nhere\n).\nRead More\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Cookie Styles\nSpanish Lard Cookies (Polvorones)\nMalted Chocolate Chip-Pecan Cookies\nCookies\nBaking\nPecans\nChristmas Cookies",
