Regular toast using a toaster oven works well if eating the sandwich right way, but in our tests, we found that it grew overly firm and stale as the day progressed, so it's less ideal for a packed lunch. Alternatively, you can lightly griddle the bread in butter or neutral oil, though again please note that bread griddled in butter is not as delicious once the bread has cooled and the butter had congealed, so not ideal for a packed lunch.\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nPeanut Butter",
