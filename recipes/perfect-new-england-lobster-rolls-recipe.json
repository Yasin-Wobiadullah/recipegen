Meanwhile, kill each lobster by pressing the tip of a heavy chef's knife in the crack just behind the eyes in the center of the carapace, pressing down to split the head in half. Using kitchen towels, twist off tail and claws (including knuckles) from carapace. Save carapace for another use. If desired, press each tail flat against the cutting board and insert wooden skewers along their entire length to keep them straight (this helps prevent it from curling when it cooks for easier cutting later, but isn't required).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSet a wire rack in a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet. Place a steamer insert in the bottom of a large lidded stock pot and add 1-inch of water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add a single layer of lobster claws and tails (about half the lobster) and cover pot. Let steam for exactly 2 minutes, then transfer to rack set in baking sheet (lobsters may still be twitching slightly\u2014this is a reflex reaction. Don't worry, they are dead.) Repeat with remaining lobster.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer to oven and roast until claws reach 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) in the center as measured on an instant-read thermometer, about 7 minutes. Remove claws and set aside on large plate. Continue roasting until tails reach 135\u00b0F in center, 7 to 15 minutes longer (depending on exact shape of tails). Remove from oven and transfer to plate with claws.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAs soon as lobster is cool enough to handle, remove meat from shell using kitchen shears, lobster crackers, and/or the back of a heavy cleaver to help crack the shells (It's ok if the meat gets a little mangled.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCut meat into 1/2 to 1-inch bite sized pieces and transfer to a large bowl. Add mayonnaise and toss well to coat. Transfer to wire mesh strainer or large colander set in a bowl. Place in refrigerator and allow to drain and cool for at least 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nDiscard any drippings (or save to eat with bread). Toss lobster with celery and chives (if using). Season to taste with lemon juice (if using), salt, and pepper. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMelt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium-low heat. Swirl to coat pan. Add 4 buns with one cut side down. Cook, pressing on buns gently and moving them around the pan until golden brown on first side. Remove from pan, add another tablespoon of butter, and toast second side. Repeat with second batch of buns. Divide filling evenly amongst all the buns and serve immediately with pickles and potato chips.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nI prefer using smaller 1 to 1 1/2 pound lobsters rather than larger ones. Lobster carapaces can be discarded or frozen and saved to make stock. If you don't have the stomach to knife your lobsters to death, you can boil them whole in step 2, separating the claws and tails before placing them in the oven.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot\n, 16\nwooden skewers\n(optional)\nRead More\nSous Vide Maine-Style Lobster Rolls (With Mayonnaise) Recipe\nConnecticut-Style Warm Buttered Lobster Rolls Recipe\nThe Ultimate Lobster, Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado, and Tomato Sandwiches Recipe\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nLobster"
