  "full_text": "Chicago-Style Hot Dog Buns Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n40 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nRising Time\n80 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n8 buns\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nlukewarm\nwater\n2 1/2\nteaspoons\ninstant yeast\n1\ntablespoon\nsugar\n1/4\ncup\ninstant mashed potato\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n2\ncups\nbread flour\n1/4\ncup\nsemolina flour\n1\ntablespoon\nolive oil\nPoppy seeds\nEgg wash\nor Quick Shine\nDirections\nMix the water, yeast, sugar, and instant potatoes in the bowl of your stand mixer. Let stand for about 15 minutes until it is bubbly and frothy.\nAdd the salt, bread flour, and semolina, and knead until the dough is smooth and is becoming elastic. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 20 minutes, then add the oil and knead until it is fully incorporated and the dough is shiny and elastic.\nCover the bowl and let the dough rise until doubled in size.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and sprinkle some cornmeal on a sheet pan.\nFlour your work surface, and knead the dough briefly, then divide it into 8 equal pieces. Form each piece into a log 5-6 inches long, depending on how big your hot dogs are. Keep in mind that the buns will expand in length as they rise and bake.\nIf you want poppy seeds or other toppings, brush the buns with an egg wash (one egg beaten with a tablespoon of water) or spray with Quick Shine to help the seeds adhere. You can also spray or brush the tops with water to make them sticky, but I find that I lose a lot more seeds that way.\nBake at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes, until the rolls are golden brown.\nYeast Breads\nMidwestern\nRolls & Buns\n4th of July\nSummer Sides"
