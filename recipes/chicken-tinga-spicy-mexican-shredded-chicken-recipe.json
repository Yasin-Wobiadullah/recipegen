Heat oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chicken skin-side-down and cook, without moving, until well-browned, 6 to 8 minutes. (Lower heat if pot is smoking excessively or chicken starts to burn). Flip chicken and cook on second side for 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate and immediately add tomatillos, tomatoes, and garlic to pot. Cook, flipping occasionally, until blistered and browned in spots, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add oregano and bay leaves and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add vinegar and stock. Return chicken to pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a bare simmer. Cover pot and cook, turning chicken occasionally, until chicken registers 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) when an instant-read thermometer is inserted into the center of thickest part, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer chicken to a bowl and set aside. Continue cooking sauce at a hard simmer, stirring, until reduced to about half its original volume, about 5 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd chipotle chiles and adobo, remove and discard bay leaves, and blend sauce using an immersion blender or by transferring to a countertop blender. Sauce should be relatively smooth, with a few small chunks. When chicken is cool enough to handle, discard skin and bones and finely shred meat. Return it to the sauce. Add fish sauce and stir to combine.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nBring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until sauce thickens and coats chicken. It should be very moist but not soupy. Season to taste with salt and pepper (if necessary).\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant-read thermometer\n,\nimmersion blender\nor\ncountertop blender\nNotes\nChicken tinga can be served in tacos; stuffed into enchiladas or burritos; on top of\nnachos\n, tostadas, and sopes; or on its own.\nRead More\nSmoky Chicken Tinga Tacos Recipe\nChicken Green Chile Tacos Recipe\nMexican Roadside Chicken with Green Onions Recipe\nMexican\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Breast\nChicken Mains\nTacos",
