On a wide rimmed baking sheet, mix 6 tablespoons of olive oil with the chili flakes, and herbes de Provence. Toss the eggplant, zucchini, bell pepper, onions, and garlic in the olive oil mixture until well coated and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the vegetables in a single layer on two baking sheets. Roast until vegetables are softened and just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Peel the paper off the garlic and discard. Lower the oven to 350\u00b0F.\nAssemble the lasagna in a 10- by 8 1/2-inch rectangular baking dish. Spread half a cup of marinara sauce on the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna sheets on the sauce, trimming as necessary so you have a single layer of noodles. Top with another 1/2 cup of sauce. Arrange half of the vegetables and garlic cloves in a single layer on the lasagna sheets. Add another layer of pasta. Top with another 1/2 cup of sauce. Top with the chopped sun dried tomatoes. Layer the second and final layer of vegetables and garlic. Top with the final layer of pasta. Top with the remaining marinara sauce. Add the water to the marinara sauce jar, shake up, and pour over the lasagna. Gently press everything down to ensure that all the pasta is coated in liquid.\nTop the lasagna with a layer of fresh herbs, then a layer of mozzarella, followed by a layer of Parmesan. Drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Wrap the baking dish in foil, and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes until bubbly. Take the foil off the lasagna, and turn the oven back up to 450\u00b0F. Bake for another 5 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly.\nAllow the lasagna to sit for 5 minutes and cool slightly. Cut into 4 squares and serve.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFrench in a Flash: Roasted Ratatouille Lasagna Napoleons\nLasagna\nVegetarian Mains\nBaked Pasta\nMozzarella\nParmesan",
