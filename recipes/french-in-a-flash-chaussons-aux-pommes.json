Peel and core the apples, and slice them into 1/2-inch slices. Toss with the 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, a pinch of salt, and the juice of 1/4 lemon.\nRoll out the puff pastry, using bench flour to prevent sticking, so that you can cut 2 circles the size of tea saucers out of opposite corners of each sheet of puff pastry: you will have 8 circles in all.\nDivide the apples among the pastries, and place them on one half of each circle. Be careful not to over stuff. If you have extra apples, fold them into the remaining scraps of puff pastry for a chef's snack. Or if you have extra pastry, cut it into strips and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and bake alongside the\nchaussons\n. For the\nchaussons\n, use a pastry brush to paint the egg wash all along the rim of the pastry. Fold over into little semi-circles, and press the edges together. Crimp with a fork. Slice 4 vents in the top of the pastry. Brush with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar.\nTransfer the\nchaussons\nto 2 baking sheets, and bake for 20 minutes. The pastry will be golden, buttery, and flakey, and the apples will be gooey, oozing, and sweet. Serve warm with cold cinnamon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (recipe follows).\nTo make the Cinnamon Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, stir together cinnamon, powdered sugar, and Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche. Chill.\nDesserts\nFrench\nPastries\nApple"
