Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, cover skillet, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, without stirring, until spinach leaves release their water, about 2 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until most of the water has evaporated, about 10 minutes longer. Add garlic and cayenne pepper and cook, stirring, until garlic's aroma has mellowed, about 2 minutes. Add artichoke hearts and cook until they begin to fall apart, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and cool until no longer steaming, then stir in mayo. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSpread about 1/2 tablespoon (7g) butter onto one side of each slice of bread, then transfer slices, butter side down, to an electric griddle preheated to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) or a large cast iron skillet preheated over medium heat. (You may need to work in batches.) Divide cheese evenly over bread slices, then top half of them with spinach and artichoke mixture. After about 5 minutes, when cheese has fully melted and bread is golden, close sandwiches with a flexible metal spatula, transfer to a cutting board, and cut diagonally with a chef's knife. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch\nstainless steel skillet\n;\nheat-resistant spatula\n;\ngriddle\nor 12-inch\ncast iron skillet\n;\nflexible metal spatula\nNotes\nI like the convenience of frozen spinach, which doesn't need to be washed, but fresh works just as well. Do be sure to use mature spinach rather than baby, which will taste too astringent here. I like the way Drunken Goat cheese melts and stretches, but if you can't find it or don't like the flavor, try Fontina or Havarti instead.\nRead More\nGrilled Cheese Sandwich Recipe\nThe Easiest, Creamiest Hot Spinach-Artichoke Dip Recipe\nGrilled Cheese Sandwiches with Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms Recipe\nGrilled Mozzarella Sandwiches With Mortadella, Pesto, and Artichokes Recipe\nAmerican\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop\nCheese\nArtichoke",
