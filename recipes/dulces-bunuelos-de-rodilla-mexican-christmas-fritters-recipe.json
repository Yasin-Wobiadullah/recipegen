Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together sifted flour, baking powder, and salt. Using fingertips, rub lard or butter into the flour mixture until mixture is crumbly. Work eggs in with fingertips until fully incorporated. Gradually stir in the warm sugar water with a silicone spatula until a cohesive dough comes together. Knead dough with stand mixer fitted with hook attachment until smooth, 10 to 15 minutes (dough will be slightly sticky). Coat a large bowl with cooking spray. Place dough in greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature until slightly puffed, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nCover a clean, dry work surface with several clean kitchen towels. On a separate clean, dry work surface, shape dough into a 6-inch square, about 1-inch thick. Divide dough into 1-inch pieces (36 total). Roll each one into a ball. Using a rolling pin (dough should be smooth but not sticky\u2014flouring the work surface is not necessary), roll each ball into a 6- to 7-inch diameter circle (each bu\u00f1uelo should be thin enough to be translucent). Arrange dough circles in an even layer on the towel-lined surface and let rest, uncovered, until dry and papery to touch, about 45 minutes. Flip circles over and allow to dry an additional 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nLine 2 rimmed baking sheets with 2 layers of paper towels. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large skillet with high sides over medium-high heat until temperature registers 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C); oil should be 1 to 1 1/2 inches deep.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nWorking 2 or 3 at a time, fry bu\u00f1uelos until golden on one side, 30 to 60 seconds. Turn over with tongs, and fry until opposite side is golden, 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer to prepared baking sheets and repeat with remaining dough, adjusting heat as necessary to maintain temperature.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nFor the Syrup:\nBring piloncillo (or brown sugar or granulated sugar), water, cinnamon stick, and anise seeds or star anise to a boil over medium-high heat in a medium-heavy heavy-bottomed saucepan, stirring often until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thick and syrupy, about 7 minutes. Strain syrup through a fine mesh sieve set over a heat-safe measuring cup, discard solids, and drizzle over bu\u00f1uelos or serve alongside.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nSpecial Equipment\nRolling pin\n, several kitchen towels,\nDutch oven\nor\nlarge skillet\nwith high sides,\ntongs\n, 2\nbaking sheets\n, paper towels, large heavy-bottomed\nsaucepan\n,\ndeep-fry thermometer\n,\nstrainer\nNotes\nIf you can\u2019t find piloncillo, you can substitute with 1 cup dark brown sugar (6.5 ounces; 186g) or 1 cup granulated sugar (7 ounces; 200g).\nRead More\nBu\u00f1uelos de Yuca y Queso (Yuca and Cheese Fritters)\nOrange Atole (Hot Mexican Corn Drink With Orange Zest)\nChampurrado (Mexican Hot Chocolate and Corn Drink)\nDesserts\nChristmas Desserts\nMexican\nFrying",
