Cut 1 onion half through root end to create two quarters. Set aside remaining onion half.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nHeat a large cast-iron skillet over high until hot and just smoking. Place the 2 onion quarters, Cubanelle chiles or banana peppers, garlic, and 1 of the jalape\u00f1os in hot skillet; cook, turning occasionally, until onion, garlic, and chiles are blistered and charred in spots, 3 to 8 minutes for garlic and onions and 5 to 10 minutes for chiles. Use tonga to transfer to a plate as they finish cooking; set aside, and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nPeel garlic and discard skins. Remove and discard stems, skins, and seeds from chiles. Transfer the charred onion, peeled garlic, and peeled chiles to a blender, along with 1 can of the tomatoes. Process until smooth, about 30 seconds; set aside.\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add taco seasoning; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and sizzling, about 45 seconds. Add ground beef, and increase heat to high. Cook, stirring and breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 3 to 6 minutes. Add tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until tomato paste fully coats and slightly thickens beef mixture, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in stock, pur\u00e9ed chile-garlic mixture, beans, corn, crushed tortilla chips, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, and remaining 1 can tomatoes. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; reduce heat to medium, and cook, maintaining a simmer and stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Season with additional salt to taste, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nFor the Salsa:\nWhile soup is simmering, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat broiler in oven. Chop the remaining onion half to equal 1/4 cup; finely chop remaining jalape\u00f1o chile to equal 1 tablespoon. (Reserve any remaining onion and jalape\u00f1o chile for another use.) In a small bowl, stir together measured chopped onion, jalape\u00f1o chile, fresh tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nUsing a ladle, divide soup evenly among 6 broiler-safe soup bowls, and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Top each bowl with a few whole tortilla chips and 1/4 cup cheese. Broil until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Top with prepared tomato-chile salsa before serving.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet, blender, large Dutch oven, 6 broiler-safe soup bowls\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup can be cooked through step 4, cooled and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. To serve soup, reheat until simmering on the stovetop, then continue with step 4 in the recipe.\nSoups\nThe Latest\nMains\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nGround Beef"
