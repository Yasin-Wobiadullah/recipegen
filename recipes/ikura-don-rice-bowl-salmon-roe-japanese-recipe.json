Let stand for at least 15 and up to 30 minutes. (This is a good time to cook the rice.)\nScoop rice into a serving bowl. Drain roe, then gently spoon onto rice. Garnish with wasabi, nori strips, and shiso, if desired. If you want, you can add other seafood to the bowl, like slices of salmon sashimi, picked cooked crabmeat, uni (sea urchin), or more.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nIf you can find Japanese cured salmon roe at a Japanese market, you can use it as is, without the marination step. Otherwise, salt-cured salmon roe (sold by good fishmongers) will work with the marination step listed here.\nRice & Grain Mains\nJapanese\nWhite Rice\nSalmon\nSeafood Mains"
