Or scoop it into a container and let it harden in the freezer for a couple of hours. Serve with Roasted Cherry Compote (or other topping of your choice) and dig in!\nFor the roasted cherry compote\nHeat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Put all but one cup of the cherries in a 12-inch saut\u00e9 pan (or any other stovetop to oven vessel with high sides), keeping them in one layer. Toss the cherries with the turbinado sugar and a pinch of salt. While the oven is heating, slice the remaining cup of cherries in half and remove the pits. Set them aside.\nRoast the cherries for about half an hour, tossing now and then, or until they are very tender and amber bubbles stack on top of each other. The cherry juices will have concentrated into a rich, dark syrup. After 20 minutes keep an eye on them, as they can burn easily.\nRemove the pan from the oven. Deglaze with the maraschino, then set it aside to cool a bit. When you can just handle the cherries, slice them in half and remove the pits. Add them back to the pan.\nReturn the pan to medium heat and add the spices, lemon zest, and reserved pitted cherries. Simmer for about ten minutes, stirring to prevent sticking. Serve immediately or at room temperature.\nIce Cream\nCherry\nSummer Desserts"
