Pulse remaining 8 cookies until finely ground and set aside.\nPlace chocolate in large heatproof bowl and melt over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring, until smooth. Remove from heat.\nAdd 1 tablespoon water to small microwave safe bowl and sprinkle gelatin over the top. Let sit 5 minutes to soften. Heat in microwave on high power until just melted, 10 to 20 seconds.\nWhisk 6 tablespoons coffee liquor into melted chocolate. Whisk in melted gelatin.\nWhip 2 1/3 cups cream with 1 tablespoon sugar to medium peaks. Fold cream into chocolate in 3 batches, until just combined. Gently fold in reserved chocolate wafer crumbs. Pour into pie shell and chill until set, about 3 hours.\nWhip remaining cup cream with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar to soft peak. Fold in remaining tablespoon coffee liquor. Serve on the side.\nNotes\nI used Nabisco Famous Wafers for the wafers. If you'd like to measure by crumbs, I used about 8 ounces for the crust and about 3 ounces for the pie. For the coffee liquor, I used Kahlua. Chilling mixing bowl with beater will make it whip faster. Use a hot wet knife to slice the pie.\nSpecial Equipment\n9-inch pie plate, food processor, mixer, microwave\nThis Recipe Appears In\nChocoholic: No-Bake Chocolate Kahlua Pie\nPies\nNo-Cook Desserts\nChocolate\nSummer Desserts",
