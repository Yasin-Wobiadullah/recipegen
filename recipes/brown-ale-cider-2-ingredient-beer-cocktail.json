Can't find them? Give Angry Orchard Traditional Dry a shot, or Original Sin Apple Cider. If you're on the East Coast, consider Harpoon Cider or Doc's Cider. West Coasters, keep an eye out for Seattle Cider Works Dry Cider or 2 Town's Bright Cider. And for the Midwesterners out there, Uncle John's Hard Cider or Vandermill Hard Apple Cider will do the trick!\nBeer\nSummer Drinks",
