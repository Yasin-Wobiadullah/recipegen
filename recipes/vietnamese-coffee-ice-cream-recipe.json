If you can't find it, a strong French roast is a decent substitution, though the flavor won't be quite the same. Do not use \"sweetened condensed filled milk,\" made with skim milk and added vegetable oil, in this recipe. Stick to brands that list milk and sugar as the only ingredients.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Many Tastes of Coffee Ice Cream: How to Make Just the Right Scoop for You\nIce Cream\nVietnamese",
