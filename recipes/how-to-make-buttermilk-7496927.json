The timing for this can vary depending on the tool used, but usually happens quickly with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, in about 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSeparate buttermilk from butterfat, straining it well. The buttermilk can now be enjoyed or refrigerated in a glass or jar until ready to drink. The cultured butterfat can be washed in a few changes of cold water until water runs clear, then kneaded into a mass, blotted dry with clean towels, and seasoned with salt, if desired. Once compressed into an even mass, it can be wrapped tightly in plastic or waxed paper and refrigerated until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer, food processor, or whisk\nMake Ahead and Storage\nThe buttermilk can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. The cultured butter can be refrigerated, well wrapped, for up to one week; discard if it grows moldy or unpleasantly sour.\nDairy Milk\nThe Latest"
