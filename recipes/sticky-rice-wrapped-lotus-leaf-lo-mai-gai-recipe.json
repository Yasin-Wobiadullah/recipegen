Let stand for at least 2 hours or overnight.\nFor the Marinated Chicken:\nIn a medium bowl, mix chicken with the remaining marinade ingredients until thoroughly combined. Let stand in refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.\nFor the Sticky Rice Seasoning:\nStir together all ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.\nFor the Lotus Leaf Packages:\nCut each lotus leaf in half down the middle. Place leaves in a large container, cover with water, weighing leaves down with a plate if necessary, and soak for 1 hour.\nSerious Eats\nDrain sticky rice well and transfer to a large bowl. Stir in dried shrimp, if using.\nIn a non-stick skillet or wok, heat 2 teaspoons of oil over high heat until shimmering. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Scrape mixture into the sticky rice and stir to combine. Stir in the Sticky Rice Seasoning.\nSerious Eats\nIn the same skillet or wok, heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil over high heat until shimmering. Add marinated chicken, and cook, stirring, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.\nIf you are using cooked salted duck eggs, peel the eggs, then slice in half and gently scoop out yolks with a spoon (it\u2019s ok if some of the egg whites are attached). If you are using raw salted duck eggs, crack the eggs into a small bowl and separate the whites from the yolks (the yolks should be bright orange and fairly firm); carefully slice the yolks in half with a knife. Set cooked or uncooked yolks aside on a small plate.\nTo form packages, drain lotus leaves, pat dry with towels, and arrange on a work surface. Alternatively, arrange 4 pieces parchment paper on work surface.\nPlace about 1/2 cup of sticky rice mixture in the center of each lotus leaf. Arrange cooked chicken, Chinese bacon, Chinese sausage, and salted duck yolks on top of each sticky rice mound. Scoop another 1/2 cup of sticky rice mixture directly on top of the rice mounds on each lotus leaf, carefully spreading it out to cover the meats and egg yolk; it's okay if the rice can\u2019t cover everything.\nWrap each lotus-leaf or parchment package by folding edges around filling to form a tight package. Using kitchen twine, tie up each package.\nSerious Eats\nBring water to a boil in a steamer setup. Arrange rice packages in steamer and steam for 1 hour 30 minutes; make sure to check water level occasionally, topping up with more boiling water if needed to prevent it from going dry.\nRemove rice packages from steamer with tongs, cut off and discard kitchen twine, and serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Shao Z.\nSpecial Equipment\nSteamer\nNotes\nIf you are planning to eat these later in the day or the next day, steam the packages, allow them to cool and then refrigerate; to reheat, steam for 10 to 20 minutes until heated through. Lo mai gai also freeze well. Just steam them, allow them to cool, wrap with a double layer of plastic wrap and freeze; to reheat, there's no need to defrost first, they can go straight to the steamer for 30 minutes until heated through.\nChinese\nChicken Thighs\nWhite Rice\nShiitake Mushroom\nSnacks & Appetizers",
