Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute.\u00a0 Stir in vegetable broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour.

Stir in chickpeas, cover, and cook until both the rice and lentils are almost cooked, about 10 minutes longer.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and with 1 tablespoon (15ml) water until smooth. Add to the soup and stir well to combine. Increase heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the harira thickens and lentils are tender, 5 to 8 minutes.\nWhile stirring the soup in a circular motion using a ladle, slowly pour the beaten egg in to form threads, then simmer harira for 1 minute until the eggs are fully cooked. Season with salt, if desired.\nStir in chopped cilantro and serve immediately with lemon wedges and more cilantro leaves.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup can be made and refrigerated for up to 5 days.\nMoroccan\nThe Latest\nSoups\nNorth African\nVegetarian"
