Cook, stirring, until fragrant and mixture starts to sizzle, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nAdd potatoes and cashews and cook, stirring, until cashews are lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add water and almond milk. Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, stirring frequently, until potatoes are fully tender, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nTransfer mixture to the jar of a high-powered blender. Add hot sauce, jalape\u00f1o pickling liquid, and a pinch of salt. Start on low speed and slowly increase speed to high. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, about 2 minutes, adding water a few drops at a time as necessary to thin to desired consistency. Season to taste with more salt.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nPress mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, using the bottom of a ladle to get it through. Cheese sauce can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 1 week. To reheat, microwave in 30 second increments, stirring in between, or reheat in a small pan on the stovetop, stirring constantly, and adding extra water to loosen sauce as necessary.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nSpecial equipment\nHigh-powered blender\nand\nfine-mesh strainer\nCheese Dips\nDairy-free\nVegan"
