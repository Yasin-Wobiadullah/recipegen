Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd broccoli rabe to boiling water and cook until thickest parts of stalks are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain well. Add rabe to skillet, toss well, and return to medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally and lowering heat as necessary to prevent scorching, until rabe is very tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Serve right away, or continue to cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for up to 20 minutes longer before serving (it just gets better and better).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBroccoli Rabe\nItalian\nGarlic\nVegetable Sides",
