Add the carrots and cook, stirring, until lightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add onion and celery. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are soft but not brown, about 7 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Add white rice flour and cook, stirring until flour just begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the water in a slow, steady stream.\nAdd the chicken thighs and chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, skim surface of any scum, then lower heat to a bare simmer. Cook, uncovered, skimming a few times, until chicken is completely tender, about 1 1/2 hours (add extra water or chicken stock as necessary to keep chicken and vegetables submerged).\nRemove the chicken from the soup with a slotted spoon and place on a clean cutting board. Allow to rest until cool enough to handle, then shred meat with fingers or two forks, discarding the bones and any excess fat or gristle. Shred or chop chicken into bite-sized pieces and return to soup. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm.\nFor the Dumplings:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the white rice flour, cornstarch, sweet rice flour, parsley, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and xanthan gum. Add the milk and eggs and stir to combine.\nBring soup to a bare simmer. Scoop the dough, about 2 tablespoons at a time, onto the top of the soup. You will get about 15 dumplings. The dumpling batter will cover the top of the soup and touch. This is normal.\nAs soon as you\u2019ve added the last dumpling, cover the pot. Set heat to low, and cook for 20 minutes without opening cover. A cake tester, skewer, or toothpick inserted into the center of a dumpling should come out clean. Spoon into individual bowls or plates and serve hot. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to four days.\nNotes\nFinely chopped chives or tarragon also make for tasty dumplings.\nRead More\nEinat Admony's Chicken Soup With Gondi (Iranian Chicken and Chickpea Dumplings) Recipe\nSopa de Alb\u00f3ndigas de Pollo (Nicaraguan Chicken Meatball Soup) Recipe\nMasa Ball Soup (Corn Dumplings in Chicken Soup) Recipe\nChicken and \"Slick\" Dumplings Recipe\nChicken Mains\nGluten-free Mains",
