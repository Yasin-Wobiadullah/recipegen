Seal and shake. Let steep for 19 days at room temperature. On day 20, add the cloves, then seal and shake. Let steep for an additional day.\nLiz Clayman\nBring sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat stirring to dissolve. Let this simple syrup cool. Strain the contents of the jar through a fine mesh strainer and then through a coffee filter. Discard the solids. Combine the strained mixture with the simple syrup in a jar or bottle. Shake and let it rest for a minimum of one day before use. Store in a sealed container at room temperature for up to one year (it's best within three months).\nLiz Clayman\nNotes\nDried bitter orange peels are available at homebrew shops or herb specialists, but you can also order them online. If you're feeling like playing mad scientist, try new herb or spice combinations like adding cinnamon or vanilla. Your homemade orange liqueur does not need to be refrigerated. It can last for a year, but is best when used within a few months.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer, coffee filters\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines\nOrange",
