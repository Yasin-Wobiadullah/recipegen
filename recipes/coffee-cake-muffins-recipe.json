Line muffin tins with muffin liners or grease with cooking spray.\nMake the streusel:\nCombine flour, dark brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl, and using a fork or your fingers mash into a paste that resembles wet sand. Set aside.\nFor the Muffins:\nIn a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and whisk until combined.\nIn a separate bowl mix together butter, oil, and sugar with an electric mixer until evenly incorporated. Add eggs one at a time, beating in between additions until mixture is smooth and all ingredients are incorporated. Add sour cream and mix until just incorporated. Gently mix wet ingredients into dry ingredients until mixture forms a thick batter.\nDivide half the batter between the muffin cups, then top with half the streusel mixture. Cover the streusel with the remaining batter, then finish by topping the muffins with the remaining streusel.\nBake muffins until a toothpick inserted comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove muffins from oven and let stand for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Serve warm.\nSpecial equipment\nmuffin tin, muffin tin liners\nBreakfast & Brunch\nMuffins\nMother's Day",
