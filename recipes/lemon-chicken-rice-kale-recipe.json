Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add the chicken and cook until well-browned on first side, about 6 minutes, then turn and cook until browned on the second side, about 5 minutes longer. Remove with tongs and set aside.\nTurn the heat down to medium and add the shallots, stirring so they don\u2019t burn, until just softened, about 30 seconds. Add the cumin, lemon zest, and saffron, and stir until fragrant, another 30 seconds. Stir in the kale, then add the broth and rice and stir together. Lay the chicken carefully on top and adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, then cover and cook until the chicken and rice are done, 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with the lemon juice and serve.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nOne-Pot Wonders: Lemon Chicken and Rice With Kale\nWhite Rice\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nQuick Dinners",
