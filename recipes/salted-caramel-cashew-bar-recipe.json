Line a 13- by 9-inch baking pan with foil. Grease foil with butter. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together butter and sugar until fluffy and light in color, about 4-5 minutes. Beat in egg, then vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture in two additions, scraping down the sides of the bowl each time.\nPlace dough in prepared pan. Using either floured hands or a piece of plastic wrap, press dough evenly into the bottom of the greased baking pan. Let chill in refrigerator for 20 minutes.\nBake crust until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove crust, but keep oven on. Let crust cool completely. While crust is cooling, make topping.\nPlace sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Heat undisturbed until bottom layer of sugar begins to melt, then stir until sugar is fully melted and smooth in texture. Cook without stirring until sugar has turned a light brown color. Pour in heavy cream, being careful of it splattering. Stir constantly until mixture is smooth again, about 5 minutes. Turn down heat and stir in butter, vanilla, and salt. Take mixture off heat and stir in cashews. Pour mixture into pan. Bake for 15 minutes.\nLet mixture cool for at least 2 hours or until set. When firm to the touch, cut into bars. Bars can be kept in the refrigerator for easier cutting.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n, 13- by 9-inch\nbaking pan\n, foil,\nsaucepan\nRead More\nPistachio Millionaire's Shortbread With Coriander Butterscotch Recipe\nCaramel Pecan Squares Recipe\nHello Dolly Bars Recipe\nKaju Katli Recipe\nDessert Bars\nBaking\nCashews"
