Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add onions and cook until outer layers are soft, about 1 1/2 minutes. Drain onions and run under cool water until cold enough to handle. Peel onions with your fingers and discard peels.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPlace onions in a medium saucepan and add heavy cream, stock, and bay leaf. Heat over medium-high heat until simmering, then lower heat to maintain a very gently simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cream has reduced to a rich sauce, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, discard bay leaf, stir in parsley, and serve. If sauce breaks and turns greasy, stir in 2 tablespoons of water and shake pan vigorously over high heat until it comes back together.\nNotes\nFrozen pearl onions can be used in place of fresh. To use frozen onions, cook direct from frozen, skipping step 1.\nRead More\nHow to Peel Pearl Onions\nEasy Roasted Cipollini Onions\nRoasted Shallots With Buttery Sweet-Tart Glaze\nVegetable Sides\nOnions\nThanksgiving Side Dishes\nEaster Side Dishes\nChristmas Sides",
