Season with salt and stir in black pepper. Fold in carrot, shallot, ginger, and green chili. Set aside.\nFor the Tadka:\nIn a small saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add 1 or 2 mustard seeds to the oil: If the oil is hot enough, the seeds will pop and rise to the surface; if it isn't, heat it a little more, then try the test again.\nOnce the oil is hot enough, add the rest of the mustard seeds along with the caraway seeds and cook, swirling gently, until the seeds stop popping and start to darken slightly, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat immediately, then add the chili powder and cayenne and swirl to incorporate. Pour the hot tadka over the raita. Stir just enough to partially incorporate the tadka into the raita, then serve.\nSpecial equipment\nBox grater\nor\nMicroplane\nNotes\nYou can substitute an equal quantity of red or yellow onion. Keep the green chili seeds if you want more heat; remove them if you don't. Avoid white mustard seeds, which don't have as strong a flavor as black or brown.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe raita can be refrigerated in an airtight container, with or without the tadka stirred in, for up to 3 days.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Science of Tadka: An Essential Technique for Blooming Spices\nCondiments & Sauces\nIndian\nYogurt & Cultured Dairy\nCarrots\nMilk"
