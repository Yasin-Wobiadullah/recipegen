In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1/3 cup water.\nPlace wonton wrappers on a work surface and cover with a moist kitchen towel. Working one wonton at a time, lay out a wonton wrapper and place 1 heaping teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture in center. Moisten the edges of the wrappers with a fingertip dipped in the egg wash mixture.\nFold one corner of the wrapper over to create a triangle. Moisten the two side corners of the triangle with egg wash and cross them over the center of the wonton. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat until all of the wontons have been sealed, and cover with a lightly dampened kitchen towel. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nToss the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon in a paper bag. Set aside.\nIn a microwave safe bowl, combine the dulce de leche, Nutella, and heavy cream. Cover with a paper plate and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Stir well. Continue to microwave and stir in 15 second intervals until pourable and smooth. Keep warm.\nHeat oil in a Dutch oven, wok, or deep fryer to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Add wontons to the oil in batches of 4 and fry, turning and agitating constantly until just beginning to turn golden, about 30 seconds (see note). Place the fried wontons on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. Transfer to the bag with the cinnamon sugar and toss to coat. Transfer wontons to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat until all of the wontons are cooked.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nServe immediately with Nutella dipping sauce.\nSpecial Equipment\nMicrowave\n;\nDutch oven\n,\nwok\n, or\ndeep fryer\nNotes\nThe wontons continue to crisp and brown slightly after they are removed from the oil, so take them out just before they reach the perfect golden color.\nRead More\nCrunchy Fried Chocolate Wontons Recipe\nOnde-Onde (Malaysian Sweet Palm-Sugar Dumplings) Recipe\nRasgulla (Indian Milk Dumplings in Sweet Syrup) Recipe\nTang Yuan (Glutinous Rice Balls) Recipe\nDesserts\nPastries\nFrying\nChocolate",
