Add the butter and salt. Process until the crumbs have the consistency of wet sand, loose but can be pressed into a shapes, about 15 seconds.\nPour the pulverized mixture into the springform pan and use your fingertips to press it into the bottom and sides to form a crust that rises two inches from the floor of the crust. Chill for at least 20 minutes. While the crust chills, twist to separate the remaining cookies and set aside.\nUsing an offset spatula, spread a 1/2 inch layer of the softened ice cream on the bottom of the crust. Cover with cookies, then a thin layer of ice cream, and repeat. Place the remaining cookies over the top. Freeze for 3 hours to solidify. 10 minutes before serving, release from the springform pan and allow the pie to sit out. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\n9-inch springform pan with 3 inch sides\nIce Cream\nChocolate\nPies"
