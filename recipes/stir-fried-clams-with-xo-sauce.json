Add clams and let stand 30 minutes. Lift clams from water and discard purging water; if there is sand in the bottom of the bowl, rinse it out and repeat this process until clams no longer release sand into the water (usually 2 to 3 purging cycles). Discard any clams that are gaping open and refuse to close when prodded.\nIn a large skillet or wok, heat vegetable oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic, white scallion parts, ginger, and Thai chili, and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are lightly golden and just begin to soften, about 5 minutes.\nAdd clams and Shaoxing wine, cover, and increase heat to high. Cook, checking every 30 seconds or so and transferring clams as they open to a large heatproof serving bowl, until all clams have opened, about 5 minutes. Taste the cooking liquid for seasoning; if it is especially salty, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the salinity is brought back into balance.\nAdd XO sauce to skillet, and stir until XO is heated through and well-incorporated. Spoon sauce over the clams, and then scatter reserved green scallion parts over top. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge skillet or\nwok\nNotes\nDry sherry, or in a pinch even a dry white wine, can be substituted for Shaoxing wine.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe clams can be purged and stored in the refrigerator up to 1 day in advance. The rest of the recipe comes together very quickly and, as with most fresh shellfish dishes, is best enjoyed immediately.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make XO Sauce, the Cook\u2019s Condiment\nHors D'Oeuvres\nClams\nChinese\nSeafood Stir-Fry"
