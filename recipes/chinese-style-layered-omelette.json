When the pan is hot, add just enough egg mixture to coat bottom of pan, swirling to ensure complete distribution. Cook until the bottom is completely set and the top is just barely set with just a trace of runniness; slide omelette onto serving plate. Top with sprinkling of sliced scallions and 1 teaspoon (5ml) of soy sauce; if using a 10-inch skillet, use 1.5 teaspoons (7ml) soy sauce.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRepeat process with remaining egg mixture, topping each layer with sliced scallions. If using an 8-inch skillet, drizzle one of the middle layers with 1 teaspoon soy sauce and drizzle the final 1 teaspoon of soy sauce over the top. If using a 10-inch skillet, drizzle remaining 1.5 teaspoons soy sauce over top. Serve immediately with piping-hot steamed white rice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch nonstick skillet or 8-inch nonstick skillet\nNotes\nWhile you can add anything you like to the egg mixture or between each layer\u2014such as thinly sliced saut\u00e9ed button mushrooms or chopped poached shrimp\u2014it is best to keep additions as simple as possible. Flowering garlic chives are an excellent addition to the egg mixture and can be found at large Asian or Chinese-American grocery stores.\nOmelettes\nEggs\nChinese\nVegetarian Mains\nScallions"
