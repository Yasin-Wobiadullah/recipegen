  "full_text": "Easy Grape Jam\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n35 mins\nCook\n65 mins\nActive\n45 mins\nTotal\n100 mins\nServes\n32\nto 40 servings\nMakes\n4\nto 5 half pint jars\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\npounds\nof flavorful\ngrapes\n,\nConcord\nor otherwise (about 2 quarts)\n1\ncup\nwater\n1 1/4\ncups\ngranulated sugar\n3\ntablespoons\nlow sugar pectin\n1/4\nto 1/2\ncup\nlime or\nlemon juice\n(see note)\nDirections\nPrepare boiling water bath canner and sterilize 5 half-pint jars by boiling them for 10 minutes. Wash lids and rings and bring to a simmer in a separate, small saucepan of water. Turn off heat and allow jars, lids, and rings to sit in hot water until you need them.\nWash and stem grapes, removing any split or compromised ones. Don't worry if small stems remain on the fruit, since they will be strained out along with the seeds. In a nonreactive, heavy-bottomed saucepan bring grapes and water to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.\nSimmer grapes, periodically stirring and crushing, until they've begun to lose their shape and you can see seeds floating in the mix, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.\nSet a food mill (with the smallest sieve in place) over a large, heatproof bowl or pitcher, and pour grapes and cooking liquid through. Mill until all that remains are the seeds, skins, and stems. You will have about 4 cups (32 ounces) of grape pulp.\nIn the same, nonreactive saucepan, stir grape pulp together with sugar, pectin, and citrus juice and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until mixture registers 220\u00b0F (104\u00b0C) on a candy or instant-read thermometer.\nTurn off heat and skim any foam with a spoon. Ladle jam into prepared jars, leaving a quarter inch of head space. Wipe the rims of the jar lids with a clean kitchen or paper towel and seal.\nPlace sealed jars back into the canning kettle. When all jars are added, make sure that the water level clears the jar lids by at least 1 inch. Add more water if necessary, and, over high heat, bring the water back up to a boil. Once the water boils, set a timer for 10 minutes.\nAfter 10 minutes, turn off heat, and allow jars to sit in water for 5 additional minutes. Then, using a jar lifter, remove the jars to a cooling rack.\nOnce jars have reached room temperature, remove rings and test that all lids have sealed properly. If any have not sealed, store them in the refrigerator. Label and store sealed jars in a cool place out of direct sunlight.\nSpecial Equipment\nFive half-pint-sized canning jars with lids and rings,\nequipment for boiling-water bath canning\n,\nfood mill\nNotes\nIf your grapes are very sweet, use a full 1/2 cup of citrus juice. More tart grapes, like Concords, only require 1/4 cup.\nRead More\nJam Making 101: The Secrets to Getting Jam to Set Like a Pro\nWater Activity and the Science of Preservation\nJams & Jellies\nGrape"
