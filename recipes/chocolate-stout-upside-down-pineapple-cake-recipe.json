Trim pineapple into 18 spears, 4- by 1/2-inches. If using fresh pineapple spears, trim them to approximately that size.\nPour melted butter into a 13- by 9-inch baking pan tilting to distribute evenly. With pastry brush, grease sides of pan with some of the butter. Sprinkle butter evenly with brown sugar, then, arrange pineapple spears in 2 parallel rows.\nFor the Chocolate-Stout Cake:\nBring stout to boil in small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent bubbling over. Cook until reduced to 1 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir in butter and cocoa powder. Cook, stirring, until mixture is homogenous.\nWhisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt together in large bowl. Whisk stout mixture into flour mixture.\nStir baking soda into buttermilk until completely dissolved and whisk into batter. Whisk in eggs and vanilla. Scrape batter into prepared pan, spreading evenly over pineapple. Bake until tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean, about 35 to 45 minutes.\nTransfer cake to cooling rack and cool 10 minutes, then, invert directly onto rack and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Serve.\nSpecial equipment\n13- by 9-inch baking pan, pastry brush, small saucepan, whisk, cooling rack\nThis Recipe Appears In\nLet Them Eat: Chocolate-Stout Pineapple Upside-Down Cake\nCakes\nBaked Fruit\nChocolate\nPineapple"
