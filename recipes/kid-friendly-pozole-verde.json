Transfer the pumpkin seeds to a bowl and set them aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd chicken, tomatillos, onion, peppers, chicken stock, oregano, and a large pinch of salt to the Dutch oven. Stir everything to combine, pushing down the chicken pieces until they are mostly submerged. Bring the broth to a boil over high heat then reduce it to a bare simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken and vegetables are completely tender, about 40 minutes.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nUsing tongs, transfer the chicken to a large plate or bowl and set aside. Add pumpkin seeds and cilantro to the Dutch oven.\nUsing a hand blender directly in the Dutch oven, or working in batches with a countertop blender, pur\u00e9e soup in batches. (If using a countertop blender be sure to start on the lowest speed and slowly ramp it up to avoid the danger of hot soup exploding out of the top). Return the soup to the Dutch oven and add the canned, drained hominy. Keep it warm on the stovetop.\nWhen the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones and shred the meat into bite-sized pieces with your fingertips. Stir the picked chicken back into the soup.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTo Serve:\nLadle the hot soup into bowls and serve, letting your dining companions garnish their soup however they\u2019d like at the table with diced avocado, diced radish, thin-sliced hot chiles, chopped cilantro, and diced white onion\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nblender\nor\nimmersion blender\nNotes\nIf you prefer no heat in your pozole, use one 7-ounce can of mild green chiles instead.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab Junior: Dakota's Red Beans and Rice\nThe Food Lab Junior: Kid-Friendly Bibimbap\nThe Food Lab Junior: Kid-Friendly Dumpling\nHow I Got My Toddler Interested in Food and Cooking\nSoups\nMexican\nChicken Legs\nPumpkin Seeds\nChicken Mains",
