Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap to contain the fine dust, close lid, and process until zest disappears. Add butter and lemon oil, if using, and pulse to form a smooth dough. With flour-dusted hands, roll dough into a 10-inch log about 1 inch thick. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours or up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBaking the Cookies:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Slice chilled dough into 1/4-inch rounds and arrange on parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving about an inch between each cookie. Bake until firm and just barely golden around the edges, about 12 minutes.\nTo Finish:\nWhen they are cool enough to handle, but still slightly warm, gently flip the cookies upside down. Sift about 1 ounce of powdered sugar on top, then flip right side up and sift another 1 ounce on top. Once cool, enjoy with hot tea or as a garnish for ice cream and sorbet. Store leftovers at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nNotes\nThis dough will not tolerate any more than a few drops of liquid, so take care when experimenting with extracts, juice, or liquors.\nCookies\nBaking\nLemon\nMemorial Day\nChristmas Cookies",
