Gently stir in scallions until just combined. Let mixture sit for 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nIn a 10-inch carbon steel skillet or crepe pan (a nonstick skillet will work too, but the pancakes won't crisp as well), heat 1 teaspoon (5 ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Holding pan off heat, pour 1/4 cup batter into pan and tilt pan in circular motion to distribute batter evenly, filling in any empty spots. Return pan to heat and cook, rotating pan occasionally to ensure even browning, until well browned on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Using spatula, flip pancake and cook until second side is browned and pancake is cooked through, 30 to 60 seconds longer. Transfer pancake to cutting board or wire rack to cool.\nRepeat Step 2 with remaining batter. Serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch carbon steel skillet or crepe pan (a nonstick skillet will work too, but the pancakes won't crisp as well)\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThese pancakes are best served and eaten immediately.\nRecipes By Diet\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nScallions",
