Pulse 4 to 5 times, then turn the processor on and process until the dough forms a shaggy ball, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Emily Dryden\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured sheet of plastic wrap and lightly flour your hands. If making crescent cookies, gently form a disk 5 inches in diameter. If making sliced cookies, form dough into a 3- by 4-inch rectangle. Dust surface with flour and wrap tightly. Lightly press with a rolling pin to smooth, then lightly tap the disk or rectangle's edges on the counter. The smoother the edges, the less prone they will be to cracking later on. Chill until the dough registers 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour. The dough may be frozen for 3 months; defrost overnight in the refrigerator to proceed.\nMeanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Stack 2 baking sheets and line the top one with parchment paper.\nFor the Filling:\nIn a small bowl, combine walnuts, 2 tablespoons sugar, honey, orange or lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg.\nFor Crescent-Style Rugelach:\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 9-inch circle, using a dinner plate and paring knife to trim edges. Spread filling over surface of dough using an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle bread crumbs evenly over filling. Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut disk into 16 equal wedges. Starting from the wide end of each long triangle, roll up and press on the pointy end to seal. Place seam side down on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining triangles, working quickly and placing cookies about 2 inches apart. Transfer baking sheet to the freezer for at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Alternatively, freeze hard and transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 6 months; defrost in the refrigerator overnight to proceed.\nSerious Eats / Emily Dryden\nFor Sliced Rugelach:\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 4- by 12-inch rectangle. Spread filling over surface of dough using an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border along the two 12-inch edges. Sprinkle bread crumbs evenly over filling. Starting at one 12-inch edge, tightly roll dough into a spiral. Aim to make 3 full revolutions, pressing seam firmly to seal. Place roll on baking sheet and freeze or refrigerate for at least 30 and no more than 45 minutes. (If chilled for longer, allow dough to warm very slightly at room temperature, so it will not crack when sliced.) Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut roll into 12 cookies, each the shape of an\nisosceles trapezoid\n. Keep the smaller edge of the trapezoid no less than 1/2 inch in length, and the larger edge no more than 1 1/2 inches in length. Place seam side down on baking sheet and transfer to freezer for at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Alternatively, freeze hard and transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 6 months; defrost in the refrigerator overnight to proceed.\nTo Finish and Bake:\nMix remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon sugar together in a small bowl. Brush cookies' surface with egg wash using a small pastry brush. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mixture. Bake cookies until browned and flaky, about 22 to 25 minutes. Some filling may squish out; that\u2019s okay. The bottoms of the rugelach should be caramelized, not blackened. Transfer the cookies (still on the parchment) to a rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Store in an airtight container, layered between sheets of wax paper, for up to 3 weeks, or freeze for up to 1 month.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nrolling pin\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n, two\nrimmed baking sheets\n,\noffset spatula\n, pastry brush,\nwire rack\nNotes\nIt\u2019s absolutely normal for the filling to squish out when the cookies bake, but if there are burnt puddles surrounding the cookies, leave a bigger border at the edge of the dough. The dough, unbaked cookies, or baked cookies may all be frozen.\nCookies\nHanukkah Desserts\nHanukkah\nBaking\nWalnuts",
