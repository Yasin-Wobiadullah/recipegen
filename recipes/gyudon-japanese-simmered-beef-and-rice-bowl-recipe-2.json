Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.\nAdd beef and cook, stirring until beef is cooked through and liquid has reduced down to an intensely flavored broth, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger and simmer for 1 minute longer. Adjust seasoning with salt and sugar to taste.\nDivide rice between 2 to 3 bowls and top with beef and sauce mixture. Garnish each bowl with a poached egg (if using), sliced scallions, beni-shoga, and togarashi. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nHomemade\ndashi\nis nice, but not necessary for this simple dish, which has so many other strong flavors. Look for thinly shaved beef at Japanese markets, ask your butcher to shave it for you, or use frozen shaved steak intended for Philly cheesesteaks. The beef can be cooked directly from the freezer if using frozen; just add a few minutes to the cooking time, and make sure to carefully stir the beef and break it apart as it thaws.\nBeni-shoga\nis bright red pickled hot ginger.\nTogarashi\nis Japanese chili powder, which comes in both\nichimi\n(chilies only) and\nshichimi\n(chilies blended with other dried aromatics) versions. Either will work on this dish. All of these ingredients can be found in any Japanese market or well-stocked Western supermarket.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nGyudon (Beef and Rice Bowl) Is Japan's Most Foolproof Dish\nJapanese"
