Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until the lentils are very soft, about 40 minutes. Add the chestnuts and simmer for 20 more minutes.\nCarefully puree the soup in a blender. (You'll probably have to do this in batches.) When done, return the soup to the pot to warm it back up.
