Stick the cloves into the onion halves and add to pot along with coriander seed, peppercorns, bay leaf, rosemary, celery, and halved garlic head. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt and enough water to cover all ingredients (about 5 quarts; 4.75L).\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nBring to a simmer and cook until meats are beginning to become tender, 1 to 2 hours. Add chicken legs and back and continue cooking until all cuts are tender enough to be easily pierced by a fork. Top up with water if needed at any point, to keep the meats submerged. The exact time it takes for all the cuts to become tender will depend heavily on the beef you have. They may not all cook at the same rate; if any become tender well before the others, transfer the finished piece to a pot or heatproof bowl with enough broth to keep it moistened, and set aside. Return to the pot with the broth when all the other cuts are tender.\nTransfer to a refrigerator overnight.\nThe next day, remove solidified rendered fat from surface of broth and return pot to the heat. Add bone-in, skin-on chicken breast and bring broth to 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C); adjust heat to maintain a temperature around 150 to 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C), until thickest part of chicken registers 150\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats/VickyWasik\nTransfer all the meats to a work surface. Remove and discard bones from short ribs and carve into slices. Remove and reserve bones from beef shanks and carve shank meat. Peel outer layer of skin off tongue and discard, then trim any gristle and slice. Discard the chicken back and all the herbs, spices, and aromatic vegetables. Carve the chuck roast and chicken breast.\nArrange all the carved meats on a large platter, along with the oxtails, chicken legs, and reserved shank bones (this is the osso buco, and it has delicious marrow in it).\nMoisten the meats with some of the warm broth (the rest of the broth can be seasoned with salt and served in soup bowls as part of the meal, or reserved to be enjoyed as broth at another time). Serve the bollito misto right away, sprinkling flaky or coarse sea salt on top and the\nsalsa verde\nand\nsalsa rossa\nalongside.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nThe meats listed here are just suggestions. Feel free to omit any you don't want or can't find, replacing them with more of some of the others (or make a smaller batch of boiled meats, as this recipe serves many people). If you can find cotechino sausage, a type of pork sausage from Northern Italy, feel free to poach it and add it, sliced, to the platter.\nItalian\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nPoached Chicken\nStovetop Beef"
