  "full_text": "Red Lentils with Paprika and Ajwain Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n75 mins\nTotal\n80 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n6\ntablespoons\nniter kibbeh\n,\nghee\n, butter, or oil, divided\n2\nmedium-large\nonions\n, roughly chopped\n1\n(\n3-inch) piece\nginger\n, peeled and roughly chopped\n6\ncloves\ngarlic\n, peeled\n1\nteaspoon\najwain\n2\ntablespoons\nsweet Hungarian paprika\n, divided\n2\ntablespoons\nhot or\nsemi-sweet paprika\n, divided\n1\npound\n(\n2\ncups\n)\nred lentils\nSalt\nDirections\nMelt 4 tablespoons of niter kibbeh in a large pot over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, combine the onions, ginger, and garlic in a food processor into a loose paste. When the fat is hot and shimmering, add the paste. Stir to prevent sticking, but let the paste develop a deep, rich brown color.\nAdd the ajwain and half of each of the paprikas. Stir so the fat coats the spices, and cook for about a minute, till the now-red paste darkens in color.\nAdd the lentils and five cups of water. Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Let the lentils stew, covered, for about an hour, or until they\u2019ve completely fallen apart. When about 3/4 of the way through, salt them well. Stir occasionally and add water if needed to prevent sticking.\nWhen the lentils are completely tender, add the rest of the niter kibbeh and the paprika, and stir to combine. This will refresh some of the aromatics lost in the long stewing; the ajwain won\u2019t need any refreshing. Serve with rice or flatbread.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Ajwain Seed\nLentils\nIndian\nVegetarian Sides\nBeans Sides"
