In a deep 10-inch frying pan or pot over medium-high heat, stir sugar, 3/4 cup water, and lemon juice until sugar is dissolved. Add orange slices and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer 5 minutes. Uncover and simmer gently, keeping slices in a single layer and turning occasionally, until they\u2019re slightly candied and translucent and liquid has consistency of a thin syrup, about 20 minutes (there should be about 1/2 cup liquid in pan; if less, add enough hot water to make that amount and shake pan to mix water into syrup). Let cool in pan. Cover and chill at least 15 minutes.\nMake cheesecake:\nPreheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Pour cracker crumbs into a 9-inch springform pan (with side at least 2 1/4 inch high); add butter and mix. Press mixture evenly over bottom and 1/2 inch up sides of pan.\nIn a large bowl, with a mixer on medium speed, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in flour, sour cream, and liqueur just until incorporated. Pour into crust-lined pan.\nBake until center barely jiggles when cake is gently shaken, 60 to 70 minutes. Run a thin-bladed knife between cheesecake and pan rim. Cool completely at room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and chill until cold, at least 3 hours.\nRemove pan rim. If any moisture has collected on top of cake, gently blot dry with a paper towel. Gently lift candied orange slices from syrup, reserving syrup, and blot dry. Arrange slices, slightly overlapping, over top of cheesecake.\nBring reserved syrup to a boil over high heat. Stir occasionally until syrup is deep golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully stir in orange juice (mixture will bubble up). Let cool to room temperature and generously brush over orange slices (you may have extra syrup).\nCut cake slices with a serrated knife, running knife under hot water and wiping clean after each slice.\nCakes\nCheesecakes\nOrange",
