Fill shaker with ice and shake well for 10 seconds; strain into a chilled highball glass and top with two ounces of chilled soda water (or more, to taste).\nFor a longer, colder drink, fill the chilled highball glass with crushed ice, and strain the drink over ice before adding the soda water. You may wish to add less soda to this version, as the ice will provide additional dilution.\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines",
