Carefully lower eggs into pot and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer), and continue cooking for 8 minutes. Drain, then fill pot with cold water. Let stand, then peel and quarter eggs.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, in a medium pot of simmering water, poach finnan haddie until just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Drain and let stand until cool enough to handle, then remove and discard any skin and bones and flake fish. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a medium bowl, wash rice in several changes of water until water is no longer cloudy. Drain well and set aside. In a measuring cup, stir the 2 teaspoons salt into stock until dissolved, then set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a medium Dutch oven, heat butter over medium heat until melted. Add onion, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in garam masala, turmeric, cardamom pods, bay leaf, and drained rice and cook, stirring often, until rice is very lightly toasted, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd stock, scraping down sides of pot to ensure all grains of rice are submerged. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until liquid is fully absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork (if rice is at all damp, keep uncovered to allow steam to escape while gently fluffing occasionally).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nGently fold in flaked smoked fish and parsley, seasoning with salt, if needed. Mound kedgeree onto a serving platter or plates, garnishing with quarted eggs and lemon wedges. Serve warm or room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nMedium (4- or 5-quart) Dutch oven\nNotes\nFor those in the United States, I recommend the finnan haddie from\nStonington Seafood\nin Maine. Feel free to substitute other smoked fish, such as smoked trout or hot-smoked salmon, if desired; many can work in this dish. Any fish that is hot-smoked (and thus cooked) does not need to be poached before adding to the rice; simply remove any skin and bones, if necessary, and flake.\nHomemade chicken stock will always have better flavor than store-bought, though this dish's spice and smoked fish flavors are prominent enough that store-bought works just fine. This recipe calls for 2 1/4 cups broth for the 2 cups of basmati rice, which is a ratio of 1.125 to 1. Many other recipes claim that the correct ratio of liquid to basmati rice is 1.5 to 1, which I've found to produce rice that's far too soupy and wet. That said, even in my own testing with different brands of basmati rice, I've found the ratio to not work exactly the same in all cases, at times producing rice that's slightly wetter or drier despite the fixed ratio. I recommend taking note of how your rice turns out after making an initial batch, then making slight adjustments, if necessary, of more or less liquid to get the perfect texture.\nBritish\nThe Latest\nWhite Rice\nRice & Grains\nFish"
