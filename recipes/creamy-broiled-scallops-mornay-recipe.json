Heat olive oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are golden brown but not quite cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to a small plate.\nAdd butter to now-empty skillet and melt over low heat. Whisk in the flour, and cook until pale golden brown, about one minute. Add the milk in a thin steady stream while whisking. Continue whisking with the pan over medium heat until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and when you run your finger down the back of that spoon, the mixture stays separated, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add piment d'Espelette or cayenne, nutmeg, and 3 tablespoons Gruy\u00e8re and whisk to combine. Set aside.\nLightly oil two small but wide ovensafe dishes. Mix the scallops and the mushrooms together, half of each in each dish, and season with salt and pepper. Spread in an even layer across each dish. Pour half of the Mornay sauce over each dish, and top with a tablespoon or so of extra grated Gruy\u00e8re. Broil for until browned and bubbling and scallops are cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, allow to cool slightly, sprinkle with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFrench in a Flash: Creamy Broiled Scallops Mornay\nScallops\nFrench\nCremini & Button Mushrooms\nSeafood Mains\nQuick Dinners",
