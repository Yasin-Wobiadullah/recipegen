Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add half of the chicken skin side down. Cook until well browned, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate, leave oil in pan, and repeat with second batch of chicken.\nPour off all but 1 teaspoon fat in pan. Add pasta pieces to pan and toast until dark golden brown, stirring frequently. Add rice, bay leaf, half tablespoon oil, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.\nStir in chicken broth, saffron, turmeric, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to simmer, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook, without stirring, for 12 minutes. Adjust heat as necessary to keep mixture at low simmer.\nRemove lid and nestle chicken pieces into rice.
