  "full_text": "Huevos Rancheros With Broiled Tomato Salsa Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n2 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\npound\nplum tomatoes\n2\nserrano chilies\n, stemmed and seeded (see note)\n6\ntablespoons\nvegetable oil\n1/4\ntsp\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n1\ncup\nwhite onion\n2\nclove\ncloves garlic\n1 1/2\ntablespoons\ncider vinegar\n4\nlarge\nlarge eggs\n4\ncups\nflour\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to upper third position and heat broiler. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place tomatoes and chilies on sheet, drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat and arrange in single layer. Broil until tomatoes and chilies begin to char, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring once halfway through cooking. Note that all broilers are different and attention should be paid to the vegetables as they cook.\nTransfer baking sheet to cooling rack and allow to cool 5 minutes. Transfer tomatoes and chilies to food processor and pulse until a chunky, salsa-like consistency is reached.\nHeat additional 2 tablespoons oil in medium skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase heat to medium-high and add tomato-chili mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Stir in vinegar and continue cooking until sauce is thick but still juicy, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer sauce to bowl and cover to keep warm.\nThoroughly wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add eggs and season with salt and pepper. Once whites begin to turn opaque and set, reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook until egg yolks reach desired consistency, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer eggs to plate, cover with sauce, and serve with warmed tortillas.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nFried Eggs\nRoasting\nTomato\nQuick Breakfast",
