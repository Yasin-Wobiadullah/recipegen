In a large measuring cup, combine wheat bran and boiling water. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir in Greek yogurt and eggs. Meanwhile, combine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, baking soda, nutmeg, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until the butter is incorporated, then add bran mixture and continue only until the batter is well combined. With a flexible spatula, scrape the bowl and fold the batter once or twice to make sure it's well mixed from the bottom up, then fold in the raisins if using.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDivide the batter between 12 lightly greased muffin cups, about 4 ounces (1/2 cup; 115g) each. This is enough to completely fill each cup with a little mountain of batter, but do not be alarmed; it will rise significantly but spread very little overall. If you like, sprinkle with flaxseed, and bake until puffed and firm, about 18 minutes. Serve warm, and store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer, nonstick or aluminum muffin pan\nNotes\nAvoid Greek yogurt thickened with gum, gelatin, or pectin. Look for brands that contain only milk and active cultures; this recipe was tested with both Fage and Chobani.\nRead More\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Whole Grains\nQuick Breakfast\nMuffins\nEaster\nMother's Day\nFather's Day",
