  "full_text": "The Secret Ingredient (Dijon Mustard): Moules Dijonnaise Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nSoaking Time\n15 mins\nTotal\n35 mins\nServes\n2\nto 4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\npounds\nmussels\n1\nspoonful\nall-purpose flour\n2\ntablespoons\nolive oil\n2\nshallots\n, diced\n1\nskinny leek\n, finely sliced into half-moons\nKosher salt\nFreshly cracked\nblack pepper\n4\ncloves\ngarlic\n, grated\n1\ncup\ndry white wine, such as\nSauvignon Blanc\nA small bunch of\nfresh thyme\n(about\n.2\nounces\n)\n1/4\ncup\nDijon mustard\n1/4\ncup\nwhole grain mustard\n1\ncup\nheavy cream\nDirections\nPlace the mussels and flour in a huge bowl, and cover with cold water. Leave the mussels to soak while you prepare the rest of the ingredients, and they will disgorge any sand they might be saving up in their bellies. Finally, drain and rinse the mussels. Throw out any that are open.\nIn a large, wide braising pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. When the oil ripples, add the shallots and leek, and season with salt and pepper. Saut\u00e9, stirring often, until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, but not golden: about 3 minutes. Lower the heat, and add the garlic, stirring it around with the other vegetables for about 45 seconds. Then add the wine, and the thyme, and season the mixture with salt and pepper. Cover the pot, keep it over low heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.\nAdd the mussels, and raise the heat to medium-high. Keep the pot covered. The mussels are cooked when they\u2019ve all opened. It takes about 5 minutes. Discard any that remain stubbornly closed.\nTurn off the heat, and stir in the mustards and the cream, until well combined into the broth. Taste the broth for seasoning, and adjust as needed. Serve right away, with a big baguette to tear apart and dip into the broth.\nMussels\nFrench\nStovetop Seafood\nSeafood Mains",
