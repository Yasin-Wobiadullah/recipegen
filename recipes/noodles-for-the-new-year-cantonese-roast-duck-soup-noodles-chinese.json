Drain, rinse in cold water, and set aside to drain again.\nPour broth and water into a saucepan and add the wine and ginger. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the greens and cook until they are just wilted and tender; do not overcook. Add the duck\u2014about 3 to 5 pieces per person\u2014and 2 or 3 tablespoons of the sauce that the shops pack with the duck. Cook until the broth just returns to a boil. Remove from the heat and add salt to taste.\nRinse the cooked noodles with a kettle of boiling water to warm and loosen. Drain thoroughly, and divide the noodles evenly between four large noodle bowls. Top each bowl with some of the greens, pieces of duck, and a teaspoonful of the scallion. Remove and discard the ginger from the broth, if desired. Ladle the hot broth over the toppings and noodles and serve immediately.\nNotes\nDon't let the noodles sit too long in the hot broth because they will absorb the liquid and lose their chewy texture.\nNoodle Mains\nDuck\nNoodles\nDuck Mains\nSoups",
