When dairy begins to bubble, add lemongrass, cover, shut off heat, and let steep for 2 hours. Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a 1 quart liquid measure. Discard lemongrass.\nWhile dairy is steeping, toss minced kumquats with 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl until sugar begins to dissolve. Let sit on counter for 10 minutes, toss again, then refrigerate overnight.\nIn another heavy medium saucepan, whisk egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup sugar together until lighter in color and slightly thickened. Slowly pour in strained dairy, whisking constantly, about 1/4 cup at a time until half of dairy is integrated into eggs. Pour in remaining dairy and whisk to combine.\nCook over medium heat, whisking frequently, until a custard forms on the back of a spoon and a finger swiped across the back leaves a clean line. Stir in salt to taste, then strain custard into an airtight container and chill overnight.\nThe next day, churn ice cream according to manufacturer's instructions. Drain kumquats from syrup, reserving syrup for another use. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and quickly fold in kumquats. Chill in freezer for at least 4 hours before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nNotes\nQuality lemongrass can be found at Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. Look for stalks with moist papery exteriors that bend when flexed, a sign of freshness.\nThis Recipe Appears In\n10 Ice Cream Recipes That Use Fall and Winter Fruit\nPSA: You Have 4 Days Left To Eat Kumquats\nIce Cream"
