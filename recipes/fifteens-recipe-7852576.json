Using a rolling pin, pound biscuits until finely crushed (some larger pieces are okay). Transfer to a large bowl. Add cherries and marshmallows. Pour over condensed milk and stir until well combined and the crushed cookies, cherries, and marshmallows are thoroughly coated in condensed milk.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nOverlap 2 pieces of plastic wrap on a clean work surface to form an 18- by 15-inch rectangle with the long edge facing you. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of the desiccated coconut in a 12- by 4-inch rectangle in the center of the plastic wrap rectangle. Using a silicone spatula, scrape biscuit mixture on top of the coconut. Using the plastic wrap to squeeze and shape, carefully roll biscuit mixture into a tight 12- by 3-inch log. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 cup desiccated coconut all over the shaped cookie log, pressing to adhere until the log is fully coated. Tightly roll up log with the plastic wrap. Wrap with another layer of plastic wrap, twisting the ends to seal. Chill until firm, at least 4 hours or up to 3 days.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nRemove log from refrigerator, and unwrap. Slice log crosswise into 15 slices. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nFifteens can be made up to 3 days in advance. Keep tightly wrapped, unsliced, and refrigerated.\nIrish\nThe Latest\nDesserts\nCondensed Milk",
