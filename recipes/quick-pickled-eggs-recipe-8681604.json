Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves, 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer until liquid reduces and darkens slightly, 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCarefully pour hot brine, along with bay leaves and peppercorns, over eggs, garlic, and dill. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCover with a lid and refrigerate until eggs taste and smell vinegary and become beige, for at least 3 days and up to 2 weeks. Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nVariations\nTo make onion-pickled eggs:\nPeel a small (approximately 130g; 4 1/2 ounce) white onion. Slice into thin rings. Layer with the hard-boiled eggs, then proceed with the recipe as written.\nTo make jalape\u00f1o-pickled eggs:\nTrim and de-seed 1 jalape\u00f1o pepper (about 1 ounce; 30g). Thinly slice pepper 1/4-inch crosswise. Layer peppers with hard-boiled eggs and proceed with step 2 above. (For spicier eggs, add 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes to the brine.)\nSpecial Equipment\n1-quart heat-proof jar, medium saucepan\nNotes\nYou can make quick-pickled eggs in any lidded glass jar or heat-proof food storage container.\n8 large hard-boiled eggs fit comfortably in a 1-quart jar, but if you are using smaller eggs, you might have room for 1 to 2 more. Avoid cramming too many eggs into the jar to provide adequate space for the brine to fully surround the eggs.\nThe recipe can easily be doubled. To pickle 16 eggs, use a 2-quart heat-proof jar or two 1-quart containers.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can\neat the eggs after 24 hours, but for maximum flavor, refrigerate for at least 3 days before serving.\nThis is a quick pickling recipe, and is not intended for canning or long-term preservation. Store quick-pickled eggs in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.\nEggs\nThe Latest\nVegetarian\nPickling\nBoiled Eggs",
