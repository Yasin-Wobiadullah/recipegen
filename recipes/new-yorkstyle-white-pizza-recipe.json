Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add cream, lower heat to medium-low, and cook until cream thickens and reduces slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in thyme, and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool completely, at least 30 minutes, before using.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nFor the Ricotta Mixture:\nIn a medium bowl, stir together ricotta, salt, thyme, and pepper. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nFor Assembling and Baking the Pizza:\nShape the dough ball using the toss-and-spin method, stretching it to a diameter of about 12 inches. The dough should be about 1/4-inch thick and slightly thicker toward the edge. Transfer the dough to a peel or an inverted sheet pan that has been dusted with flour.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nSpread prepared white sauce in a thin, even layer over the surface of the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch border uncovered. Spread ricotta mixture evenly over the white sauce.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nCarefully slide the pizza from the peel onto the baking steel. Bake until the crust is crisp and slightly charred on the edges and the cheese is bubbling and just beginning to caramelize, about 8 minutes. (The underside of the crust should be brown and crisp, not white and soft.)\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nRemove the finished pizza from the oven and garnish it immediately with the parsley. Let the pizza cool for about 3 minutes before slicing and serving. If you want a \u201csnappier\u201d crust, let the pizza cool completely, then return the individual slices to the hot oven for recrisping.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nSpecial Equipment\nSmall heavy\nsaucepan\n,\nbaking stone\nor\nsteel\n,\npizza peel\nor\nbaking sheet\nRead More\nNew York-Style Pizza Recipe\nPizza with Pesto, Ricotta, and Mozzarella Recipe\nPizza With Fresh Clams, Garlic, Mozzarella, Romano, and Basil Recipe\nClassic Tarte Flamb\u00e9e (Alsatian Pizza With Fresh Cheese, Onions, and Bacon) Recipe\nPizza\nRicotta",
