Add beans, bay leaves, and 8 cups (2L) water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are completely tender and liquid is reduced to a rich consistency, about 3 hours. Stir in sugar to dissolve, stir in vinegar, season to taste with salt and pepper, discard bay leaves, and serve.\nTo Cook in a Pressure Cooker:\nHeat vegetable oil in a pressure cooker on medium-high heat until shimmering (if using an electric pressure cooker, set it to \"saut\u00e9\" and allow to preheat).
