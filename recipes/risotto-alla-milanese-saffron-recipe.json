Agitate rice with fingers or a whisk to release starch. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer set over a 2-quart liquid cup measure or large bowl. Allow to drain well, shaking rice of excess liquid.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nHeat oil in a heavy 12-inch saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add rice and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until all liquid has evaporated and rice sizzles and takes on a nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add onion and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pan is nearly dry, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nGive reserved stock a good stir and pour all but 1 cup over rice. Add saffron and a large pinch of salt, increase heat to high, and bring to a simmer. Stir rice once, making sure no stray grains are clinging to side of pan above the liquid. Cover and reduce heat to lowest possible setting.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nCook rice for 10 minutes undisturbed. Stir once, shake pan gently to redistribute rice, cover, and continue cooking until liquid is mostly absorbed and rice is tender with just a faint bite, about 5 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nRemove lid. Stir remaining 1 cup of stock to distribute starch, then stir into rice. Increase heat to high, add butter, and cook, stirring and shaking rice constantly until butter has melted and rice is thick and creamy; add more stock or water as necessary if risotto becomes too dry. Off heat, add cheese and stir rapidly to thoroughly incorporate. Fold in heavy cream, if using. Season with salt. Serve immediately on hot plates, passing more cheese at the table.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n, large\nsaut\u00e9 pan\n(about 12 inches wide)\nNotes\nChicken stock adds a deeper, meatier flavor, while vegetable stock creates a lighter-tasting risotto; I recommend chicken unless you want to keep the dish vegetarian.\nWhipped cream is not a traditional ingredient in Milanese risotto, but it adds an ethereal lightness and creaminess that's hard to top. Feel free to omit it.\nRead More\nPerfect Risotto\nRice & Grain Mains\nItalian\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop\nRice & Grains",
