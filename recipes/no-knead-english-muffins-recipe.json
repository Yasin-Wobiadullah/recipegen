Add milk, honey, and egg white, stirring with a flexible spatula until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic and set aside until spongy, light, and more than doubled, 4 to 5 hours at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). (The timing is flexible depending on your schedule.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Second Rise:\nThickly cover a rimmed aluminum baking sheet with an even layer of cornmeal. With a large spoon, dollop out twelve 2 2/3\u2013ounce (75g) portions of dough; it's perfectly fine to do this by eye. If you'd like, pinch the irregular blobs here and there to tidy their shape. Sprinkle with additional cornmeal, cover with plastic, and refrigerate at least 12 and up to 42 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Griddle and Serve:\nPreheat an electric griddle to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) or warm a 12-inch cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. When it's sizzling-hot, add half the butter and melt; griddle muffins until their bottoms are golden brown, about 8 minutes. Flip with a square-end spatula and griddle as before. Transfer to a wire rack until cool enough to handle, then split the muffins by working your thumbs around the edges to pull them open a little at a time. Toast before serving and store leftovers in an airtight container up to 1 week at room temperature (or 1 month in the fridge).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n;\nelectric or cast iron griddle\n, or\n12-inch cast iron skillet\n; square-end spatula;\nwire rack\nNotes\nThis recipe was developed and tested with King Arthur's bread flour and classic whole wheat flour. While English muffins can be adapted to any brand, differences in starch content and milling practices may necessitate an adjustment in hydration. Stone-ground whole wheat may require as little as 10 ounces milk (1 1/4 cups; 285g), while white whole wheat may accommodate a splash more.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStore leftover English muffins in an airtight container up to 1 week at room temperature, or 1 month in the fridge.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nYeast Breads\nMuffins\nEaster\nMother's Day"
