Use a slotted spoon to gently place the eggs in the water, and cook them for 10 minutes (set a timer). Drain the eggs and run them under cold water until they\u2019re fully cool.\nLightly tap each egg against the counter to crack the shell all over, then peel them and pat them dry. Halve them lengthwise with a sharp knife.\nScoop the yolks into a small food processor. Add the mayonnaise and blend until smooth, then add the vinegar, creme fraiche, and mustard and blend again. Have a taste and season with salt.\nFor really pretty eggs, feed the mix into a pastry bag (alternatively, you can jerry-rig one with a large resealable plastic bag; snip off a corner before piping).\nPop it into the fridge for 30 minutes. Put the egg whites on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and put them in the fridge as well. Pat the whites dry with a kitchen towel and pipe or spoon an equal amount of the yolk mixture into each white. Top each one off with a sprinkle of the chives and chervil and a dusting of cayenne or paprika. If you like, add a sprinkle of sea salt and a drizzle of olive oil and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nSmall food processor\nDeviled Eggs\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nBoiled Eggs\nQuick Snacks"
