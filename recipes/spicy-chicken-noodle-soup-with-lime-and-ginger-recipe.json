Discard skin and set breasts aside. Remove legs from chicken and set aside. Using a heavy knife or cleaver, roughly chop the body into fine pieces. Transfer the chicken body and legs to a large saucepan. Add ham, ginger, garlic, lemongrass, cilantro stems, mint stems, and scallion whites. Cover with water and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce to low and simmer, skimming scum from surface and topping up with hot water as necessary, until rich and flavorful, about 45 minutes total. Add chicken breasts to pot for last 10 minutes of cooking.\nStrain broth through a fine mesh strainer into a 2 quart liquid measuring cup. Remove cooked chicken legs and breasts to a plate and set aside. Discard remaining solids. Add enough hot water to broth to equal two quarts. Rinse pot and return broth to it. Add onion, carrots, cabbage, and Thai chile and bring to a simmer. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes longer, adding noodles in for last 5 minutes of cooking time (or according to package directions).\nMeanwhile, when chicken is cool enough to handle, roughly shred breast and leg meat into bite-sized pieces, discarding skin and bones.\nWhen noodles and vegetables are soft, add fish sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, and shredded chicken to pot. Season to taste with salt (if necessary). Serve immediately, garnishing each bowl with picked mint leaves, cilantro leaves, and scallion greens.\nNotes\nMake sure to carefully wash your cutting board and hands after chopping the Thai chile. You can use 1 jalape\u00f1o or 1 serrano chile in place of the Thai chile.\nRead More\nKhao Piak Sen (Lao Chicken Noodle Soup) Recipe\nReal-Deal Khao Soi Gai (Northern Thai Coconut Curry Noodle Soup with Chicken) Recipe\n30-Minute Pressure Cooker Pho Ga (Vietnamese Chicken Noodle Soup) Recipe\nThe Ultimate Chicken Noodle Soup Recipe\nSoups\nWhole Chicken\nNoodles\nGinger\nQuick Dinners"
