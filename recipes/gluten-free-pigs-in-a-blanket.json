  "full_text": "Gluten-Free Pigs in a Blanket Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\nAbout 30 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n5\nounces\n(\n1 1/4\ncups\n)\nwhite rice flour\n3\nounces\n(\n3/4\ncup\n)\ncornstarch\n1\nounce\n(\n1/4\ncup\n)\nsweet rice flour\n2\nteaspoons\nbaking powder\n1\nteaspoon\ngranulated sugar\n1/4\nteaspoon\nsalt\n1/4\ncup\n(\n4\ntablespoons\n)\nunsalted butter\n, chilled and diced\n1/2\ncup\nplus additional\nmilk\nas needed\n2\nlarge\neggs\n, divided\n1\npackage\n(\n16\nounces\n)\ngluten-free cocktail wieners\nDirections\nPreheat the oven to 400oF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the white rice flour, cornstarch, sweet rice flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.\nAdd the butter, and using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work it into the flour mixture until no large pieces remain. The mixture should be coarse, with tiny pebbles of butter distributed thoroughly throughout.\nUsing a wooden spoon, stir in 1/2 cup of the milk and 1 egg. Blend until a dough forms. The dough will be dry and won\u2019t hold together, add a splash (about 2 tablespoon) more milk until dough is firm and forms a ball when rounded between your palms.\nPinch off little balls of dough, about 1 generous teaspoon each. Press the dough evenly around a cocktail wiener to coat the wiener. Leave ends of the wiener exposed. Don\u2019t worry about the dough jacket being perfect. You just want to encase the sausage in dough. Looks don\u2019t matter. Place on the prepared pan. Repeat until all the dough and wieners are used.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the remaining egg and about 1 tablespoon milk with a fork. Using a pastry brush, brush the egg mixture onto each dough wrap.\nBake 15 to 18 minutes, until the dough is light golden brown. Remove from pan and serve hot.\nHors D'Oeuvres\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nSavory\nSausages",
