Pulse 3 to 4 times until incorporated. Add olive oil and water. Run food processor until mixture forms a ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, about 15 seconds. Continue processing 15 seconds longer. Alternatively, combine ingredients in a stand mixer and mix on low speed for 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nTransfer dough ball to a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice by hand until a smooth ball is formed. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper lock bag, seal, and place in the refrigerator. Allow to ferment for at least 1, and up to 5 days.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nAt least 2 hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and divide into 4 even balls. Shape into balls by gathering dough towards the bottom and pinching shut. Flour well and place each one in a separate bowl (cereal bowls or small mixing bowls work well). Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room temperature until roughly doubled in volume.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nMeanwhile, adjust oven rack with pizza stone to top position and place a second rack one position below it. Preheat oven to 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C, or as hot as your oven will allow) for at least 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nTurn a single dough ball out onto floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 12-inch circle, lifting and stretching by hand if necessary. Grease an aluminum baking sheet with 1 tablespoon canola oil. Transfer dough to baking sheet. Spread about 1/2 cup of sauce evenly over entire surface of pie. Sprinkle with 1/4 of parmesan. Spread 1/4 of cheese in even layer over surface. Top with additional toppings as desired.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nPlace in oven on rack immediately under the baking stone. Bake until edges are just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven (close oven). Using a thin flexible metal spatula, carefully separate the pizza's edges from the pan (the pizza should slide around freely). Carefully slide pizza off of pan and onto baking stone. Continue baking until bottom is deep golden brown and cheese is melted and bubbly. Transfer pizza to a cutting board with a pizza peel. Cut into 8 slices, and serve. Repeat steps 5 and 6 with remaining pizzas.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\npizza stone\n,\naluminum pizza pan\nPizza\nSnacks & Appetizers\nGame Day"
