Taste and season with salt if desired. Set aside while preparing cold foam.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Cold Foam:\nIn a small jar or measuring cup, use a hand-held milk frother or immersion blender to whisk half-and-half until light and airy like sea foam and just barely flowing, 30 to 60 seconds. Alternatively, use a personal blender and pulse for a few seconds until light and airy.\nPour pistachio hot chocolate into 2 mugs and top with cold foam. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nVariation\nTurn this into a latte by adding a shot of your favorite espresso to your pistachio white hot chocolate before topping with the cold foam.\nSpecial Equipment\nSmall saucepan, whisk,\nhand-held milk frother\n,\nimmersion blender\n, or personal blender\nNotes\nPistachio cream is available at most major retailers and Italian specialty stores, usually located near the other nut butters and spreads. I recommend looking for a spread that uses pistachios from Sicily, such as Pisti or Pistacchiosa.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis pistachio white hot chocolate is best enjoyed immediately.\nHot Chocolate & Cocoa\nThe Latest\nHolidays & Seasons\nValentine's Day\nWinter Drinks",
