Alternatively, plug in a slow cooker.\nPat short ribs dry with clean towels. Lightly season short ribs on both sides with salt and more generously with black pepper. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add short ribs in a single layer, working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pot. Brown well on all sides, then transfer to a plate and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons (30ml) fat from Dutch oven.\nAdd onion, ginger, garlic, and five-spice powder to Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until onions are slightly softened and fragrant, about 4 minutes.\nAdd strips of orange zest and 1/4 cup (60ml) orange juice along with rice wine or sherry, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, honey, chili paste, hoisin, and chicken stock or water. Stir to combine. Return ribs to Dutch oven along with any accumulated juices. (Alternatively, add ribs, vegetables, and liquid to slow cooker.)\nIf Using a Slow Cooker:\nSet slow cooker to high and cook until meat is tender and frees easily from bones, 6 to 8 hours.\nIf Using a Dutch Oven:\nBring contents to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven. Cook until short ribs are tender, about 3 hours. Check periodically during cooking process and add more stock or water if needed. Remove lid during the last 20 minutes of cooking. The meat should be very tender but not completely falling apart.\nWhen meat is cooked, remove ribs and keep warm in a serving dish. Strain braising liquid into a fat separator (or strain braising liquid, then spoon off as much fat as possible), then pour strained, defatted sauce back into pot. Discard aromatic vegetables. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) orange juice. You should have about 3 cups (720ml) total braising liquid; if not, simmer until reduced to 3 cups. Whisk in just enough of cornstarch mixture to slightly thicken sauce, adding it in 1-tablespoon increments (you may not need the whole amount).\nReturn short ribs and reduced sauce to Dutch oven, coating short ribs well with sauce. Sprinkle with scallions and remaining grated orange zest and serve with\nmashed potatoes\nor\npolenta\n. Leftover ribs can be reheated before serving, or meat can be boned, shredded, tossed with braising liquid, and folded into tacos.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n, slow cooker (optional),\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nMake sure to get the English cut of short ribs, which leaves one large rib bone in each piece of beef; flanken-cut ribs should be avoided, since each piece of beef will have several cross-cut bones in it.\nRead More\nRed Wine\u2013Braised Beef Short Ribs\nBeef Short Rib Rendang\nSichuan Red-Braised Beef\nWhat Are the Best Cuts of Beef for Stew?\nBeef Mains\nChinese\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nSlow Cooker\nShort Ribs"
