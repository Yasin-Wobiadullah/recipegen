Discard the pods. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Working with one vegetable at a time, blanch the favas, peas, asparagus, snap peas, and broccolini in the boiling water for 1 minute, transfer to the ice bath to cool, then transfer to a paper towel-lined tray and pat dry. Remove and discard the skins from each individual fava bean. Set vegetables aside.\nTear bread into small pieces and transfer to the bowl of a food processor, mini-chopper, or blender. Pulse until reduced to fine breadcrumbs.\nHeat butter in a small skillet over medium heat until melted, then add breadcrumbs and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Add half of shallots and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, add half of parsley and half of chives, and toss to combine. Season mixture to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIn a large bowl, whisk together lemon juice, lemon zest, and remaining shallot, parsley, and chives. Slowly drizzle in olive oil, whisking constantly. Add blanched vegetables, toss to combine, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide vegetables between 4 serving plates or bowls, making a small indentation to place the egg.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTransfer poached eggs to skillet with breadcrumbs and turn them carefully to coat in crumbs. Place eggs on top of salad and spoon any remaining crumbs on top. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / J.
