Place cupcake liners in a 12-cup muffin pan. Stir cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Whisk in pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, egg yolk, and vanilla until combined. Add a few dabs of orange food coloring if desired. Set aside.\nHeat butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring, until melted and smooth. Place eggs, sugar, and salt in large bowl and whisk until lightened, about 45 seconds. Whisk in chocolate mixture and vanilla until mixture is glossy and smooth. Add flour, cocoa, and baking powder and then whisk until completely combined.\nDivide brownie batter between the cups, reserving about 3/4 cup. Divide pumpkin batter between the cups. Portion the remaining brownie batter between the cups. Using a butter knife, swirl the batters together (see note).\nBake until edges are slightly puffed and center is just set, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan before removing. These can be eaten room temperature (they will be soft) or chill to fully set. Refrigerate leftovers.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-cup muffin pan\nNotes\nIt's easiest to swirl the batters together before the brownie batter cools and begins to thicken. This recipe will completely fill the cupcake cups. Depending on what size cups you use, you may have a bit of batter left over.\nDesserts\nChocolate\nPumpkin\nHalloween",
