Place bacon in the basket, trying not to overlap (it\u2019s okay if the bacon comes up the sides of the basket slightly). Cook, using tongs to flip halfway through, for 8 to 10 minutes for tender-crisp and 10 to 12 minutes for shattering-crisp bacon. (For thick-cut bacon, cook for 12 minutes for tender-crisp and 14 to 15 minutes for shattering-crisp, flipping halfway through).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer the bacon onto a plate lined with paper towels and allow it to drain. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nAir fryer\n,\ntongs\nNotes\nDepending on the air fryer you have (or how crispy you\u2019d like your bacon), you may have to adjust the cooking time.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe bacon can be made ahead of time and reheated in the air fryer. If you plan to reheat the bacon, undercook the bacon slightly. To reheat bacon in the air fryer, preheat air fryer to 350\u00baF (175\u00baC), place bacon in basket, and heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes.\nBacon\nThe Latest\nBreakfast & Brunch\nPork",
