Using sharp kitchen shears, remove the backbone by cutting along either side of it. Turn chicken over and lay out flat. Press firmly on breast to flatten the chicken. For added stability, run a metal or wooden skewer horizontally, entering through one thigh, going through both breast halves, and exiting through the other thigh. Tuck wing tips behind back. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nCombine salt, brown sugar, black pepper, chile powder, ground coriander seeds, and garlic in a small bowl and massage with fingertips until homogenous. Spread mixture evenly over all surfaces of chicken.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil\nthe grilling grate. If using charcoal, place hardwood chunks directly on coal.

Close grill and cook until center of thickest part of chicken registers 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 35 to 45 minutes. Brush top of chicken with barbecue sauce. Cover and continue cooking for 5 minutes until sauce is beginning to dry. Brush with more sauce, cover, and continue to cook until thickest part of breast registers 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes longer. Using tongs and a flexible metal spatula, carefully flip the bird and place it skin side down directly over the coals. Brush back of chicken with more sauce. Continue to cook, covered, until brown, crisp, charred in spots, and thickest part of breast registers 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 7 to 10 minutes longer. If bird threatens to burn before temperature is achieved, carefully slide to cooler side of grill, cover, and cook until done. Remove from grill, let rest 10 minutes, carve, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nSpecial Equipment\nCharcoal grill\n,\nchimney starter\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nskewer\nNotes\nThis recipe calls for a large chicken.
