Gently swish with your hand, then drain through a fine-mesh strainer. Shake well to remove any lingering water, then return poh\u00e9 to the empty bowl. Let sit, gently stirring poh\u00e9 occasionally with a metal fork to separate grains and prevent clumping and being careful not to break grains, until grains are soft enough that, when a grain is pressed gently between thumb and forefinger, it breaks, about 15 minutes. If poh\u00e9 is too dry, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of water over top and mix in gently, then rest poh\u00e9 about 5 minutes longer before checking texture again. Once softened, gently stir in in 1/4 teaspoon turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon sugar.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nWhile poh\u00e9 rests, in a 6-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until just smoking, about 1 minute. Keep a lid/screen handy. Reduce heat to low and test the oil with one mustard seed. If it pops right away, the oil is ready; if not, return heat to medium-high for 1 additional minute and retest. When ready, quickly add the remaining mustard seeds to the saucepan and cover with the lid/screen. The mustard seeds will pop, making a sound like popping corn until the popping stops, about 20 seconds. Immediately uncover pan, reduce heat to low, and quickly stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon turmeric, asafetida, and green chiles to oil. Increase heat to medium and immediately add onion and curry leaves, if using, and cook until onion is softened, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nStir in the vegetable of your choice and increase heat to medium\u2013high. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Cover pot, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender (or potatoes: 10 to 12 minutes; for cauliflower: 7 to 8 minutes; for green peas and tomatoes: 2 to 3 minutes).\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nGently stir in softened poh\u00e9, then cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until grains are heated through and everything is tinged in yellow, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nStir in lime juice and cilantro. Season to taste with salt, lime juice, and/or sugar, if needed. . Transfer to serving bowls, sprinkling poh\u00e9 with cilantro and coconut, if using. Serve with plain yogurt on the side, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer, 6\u2013quart saucepan with lid or splatter screen\nNotes\nPoh\u00e9 can be purchased at South Asian grocers. Make sure to buy thick poh\u00e9 (poha) so that when it is rehydrated, it does not disintegrate. Do not use hot water to rinse and rehydrate the poh\u00e9, as that will also make it fall apart.\nAsafetida can be found at most Indian grocers. It\u2019s also available to purchase online. I recommend the powder sold in small jars, rather than large plastic containers, because they absorb the aroma. You will smell an onion-garlic aroma from the asafoetida when you open the container. Keep it tightly shut between uses, otherwise the smell will pervade your entire kitchen. While it adds a distinctly assertive garlic-and-onion flavor to the poh\u00e9, you can omit it if unavailable, though the result will be less aromatic.\nDo not use a nonstick pan or a plastic or wooden stirrer when making poh\u00e9. The nonstick pan is has a dark interior that makes it difficult to see the spices when cooking, increasing the risk of scorching them, while plastic or wooden spoons are more likely to break the poh\u00e9 or make it clump up.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPoh\u00e9 can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day. To reheat, microwave poh\u00e9 with 1 added tablespoon of water in a bowl, covered, until hot.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nThe Latest\nWhite Rice\nIndian",
