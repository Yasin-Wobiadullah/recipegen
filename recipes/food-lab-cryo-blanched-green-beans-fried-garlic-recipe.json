Once they are completely frozen, after about 3 hours, transfer them to a zipper-lock freezer bag, squeeze out any excess air, seal, and return to the freezer; they should be good for at least a few months and can be cooked directly from frozen. To proceed with this recipe, thaw green beans for about 30 minutes, then dry thoroughly with paper towels.\nFor the Fried Garlic (if using):\nWhile green beans are thawing, line a rimmed baking sheet with 6 layers of paper towels. Place garlic in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 8 to 10 times, scraping down sides and redistributing garlic as necessary, until it is chopped into pieces no larger than 1/8 inch across.\nCombine chopped garlic and oil in a wok or medium nonstick saucepan. Place over high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is completely soft, about 20 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is light golden brown, about 8 minutes. Do not let garlic get beyond golden brown, or it will become very bitter. About 15 to 20 seconds before you think the garlic is done, transfer it immediately to a fine-mesh strainer set over a heatproof bowl or saucepan; set garlic oil aside to cool and reserve for another use.\nTransfer fried garlic to the paper towels. Lift up one end of top layer of towels and roll garlic off onto the second one. Blot with first towel to absorb excess oil, then repeat, transferring garlic from one layer of paper towels to the next, until only one layer remains. Season well with salt and allow to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Once it has cooled, transfer garlic to an airtight container and store at room temperature for up to 3 months. (You will not need the full yield of fried garlic for this recipe.)\nTo Finish the Green Beans:\nHeat olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add beans and cook, without stirring, until lightly blistered on first side, about 1 minute. Add sliced garlic and cook, stirring and tossing, until garlic is light golden brown. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle with additional olive oil, if desired, and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons fried garlic, if using. Serve.\nNotes\nInstead of cryo-blanching the fresh green beans, you can blanch them in 4 quarts of salted water for 3 minutes, then drain.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nfood processor\n,\nwok\nor medium nonstick saucepan, fine-mesh strainer,\n12-inch skillet\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: How to Cryo-Blanch Vegetables\nGreen Beans\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop Vegetables\nGarlic",
