Meanwhile, whisk orange juice, olive oil, and agave nectar together in a large bowl. Add butternut squash, onion, garlic, and whole sage sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Stir until the squash and onion are evenly coated then transfer mixture onto 2 foil-lined rimmed baking sheets. Place sheet trays in the oven and roast until squash is completely tender and browned around the edges, about 40 minutes total, rotating pans half way through cooking.\nRemove the squash mixture from the oven, discard sage sprigs, and allow to cool. Transfer mixture to the work bowl of a food processor, add blue cheese, and process until completely smooth, about 30 seconds. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large plate, spread into an even layer, then place uncovered in refrigerator and allow to cool completely, at least 45 minutes.\nWhen ready to roll, divide dough into four even sections. Working one section at a time, with remaining sections tightly wrapped in plastic, roll dough through machine until sheet is just under 1/16th of an inch thick (typically second-to-last setting). Cut sheet in half to create 2 pieces of dough roughly 15 inches long and 5 inches across.\nIf using a ravioli mold:\nPlace first sheet of dough over metal base. Gently and evenly press plastic mold down to make depressions in dough. Remove and fill each depression with approximately 1 tablespoon filling. Rap mold once or twice to remove any air bubbles. Place second sheet of dough over surface and pat down. Run rolling pin over dough until ridges beneath become visible. Flip the mold over and gently peel it away. If ravioli remain stuck, rap edge of mold on table. If ravioli do not separate easily, use fluted ravioli cutter to complete perforation. Cover ravioli with towel to prevent drying. Repeat with remaining dough and continue to step 6.\nIf working by hand:\nFold first sheet along its midline to make a light crease and re-open. Place 6 heaping tablespoons half inch apart along length of lower half. Moisten upper half with pastry brush dipped in water and fold over, pressing down to remove air bubbles and create a seal around filling. Using fluted ravioli cutter or kitchen knife, cut between filling for 6 even squares. Cover ravioli with towel to prevent drying. Repeat with remaining dough.\nAt this point, ravioli can be frozen: place ravioli on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and freeze completely. Transfer to a freezer bag, press out as much air as possible, and store in freezer for up to 2 months.\nTo cook ravioli, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a large saucepan, melt butter over low heat. When butter begins to bubble, add chopped sage and stir until butter is brown and sage is crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Off heat, squeeze in lemon juice. Season with salt and set aside. Cook ravioli by submerging in boiling water and cooking for 3 minutes (ravioli should float). Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of cooking liquid. Transfer ravioli and liquid to pot with browned butter. Heat over high heat, gently folding and tossing until a rich, emulsified sauce is formed, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nPasta machine, ravioli maker (optional), ravioli stamp or wheel\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Perfect Ravioli From Scratch\nThe Science of the Best Fresh Pasta\nItalian\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Pasta\nBlue Cheese\nStuffed Pasta",
