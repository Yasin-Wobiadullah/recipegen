Place a weight or wet paper towel on top to help submerge the peppers. Let stand until peppers are fully softened, 30 minutes to 1 hour. If the peppers are very stubborn (as thick-skinned \u00f1oras can be), you may need to tear a small hole in them to let water penetrate inside.\nDrain peppers and discard stems and seeds. Using a paring knife, carefully scrape the flesh from the skins. Discard skins.\nIn a 3-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onion, green pepper, red pepper, leek, and scraped rehydrated chile flesh (if using), season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring, until vegetables have released their liquid and are beginning to brown lightly on the bottom of the pan, about 10 minutes.\nLower heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring and scraping frequently, until sofrito is sweet to the taste and a deep golden brown color, about 45 minutes longer. You should have about 2 cups. You can refrigerate the sofrito in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nFor the Paella:\nMake sure your grill is on a level surface.\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over the coal grate. Set cooking grate in place and set a 17-inch paella pan on top of that.\nAdd oil to paella pan, pushing it around with a long metal spatula (a stainless-steel wok spatula can work well here) to coat the entire surface, and heat until oil is lightly smoking.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSeason chicken and pork all over with salt, then add to pan and cook, turning, until deeply browned on both sides, about 8 minutes (see note). Transfer pork to a platter and leave chicken in the pan, pushing the chicken pieces to the outer edge.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd chorizo to the pan and cook, stirring, just until fat starts to render. Add tomato pur\u00e9e, sofrito, paprika, and saffron, and cook, stirring and scraping until tomato sauce is moderately browned, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd stock (or water) and bring to a rolling boil. Season lightly with salt. Sprinkle in rice all over, making sure all grains are submerged and none are stuck on top of the pieces of chicken. Using your spatula, gently swirl the liquid around to distribute the rice evenly. Return to a boil.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNestle clams and mussels in the liquid and cook, without stirring, for 8 minutes. Add shrimp to the paella pan and return the pork to it as well, nestling the pieces down into the cooking rice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAt this point, depending on the heat of your grill, you will likely want to raise the paella higher aloft to increase its distance from the heat source and lessen the chances that it burns below (unless your grill has gotten so tepid that the paella is barely simmering, you'll want to do this). To do it, lift the paella pan carefully off the grill and set either wadded-up aluminum foil or, for an even higher lift, bricks, on the grill grate (it helps to have another person aid you during this step).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSet the paella pan back on the grill and continue cooking until the rice is just al dente and the liquid has fully been absorbed, about 8 minutes longer; turn the clams, mussels, shrimp, and pork once during this time to heat them through on both sides. If the liquid cooks off and the rice isn't done enough, add more boiling-hot stock or water in small additions until the rice reaches the desired doneness. You can also use a spoon to carefully dig into the paella and check the bottom of the pan to make sure nothing is burning.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen the rice is perfectly cooked and the liquid is fully absorbed, remove from heat and let rest 10 minutes before serving with lemon wedges.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n17-inch paella pan\n,\nlong metal spatula\n, aluminum foil and/or 3 or 4 bricks,\ncharcoal grill\n,\nchimney starter\nNotes\nSpanish dried \u00f1ora peppers add an earthy note to the sofrito; ancho chiles are a close approximation, though they have more heat. You can also omit the peppers entirely.\nPlease note that it's imperative you follow all the doneness cues in this recipe; the times are rough estimates since the actual timing of each step will vary heavily depending on the heat of your grill. This means that if your meat browns in a fraction of the stated time, you must move on to the next step and not adhere to the estimated time; if it takes longer, you must allow it to proceed beyond the estimated time (or boost the heat of your grill).\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe sofrito can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to five days; this recipe should yield more than the paella requires, so feel free to use the remainder as a base for braises, sauces, and other long-cooked dishes.\nRead More\nGrilled Chicken and Pork Paella\nArroz al Horno Valenciano (Spanish Baked Rice)\nSpanish\nSummer Mains\nRice & Grains\nGrilling\nChicken"
