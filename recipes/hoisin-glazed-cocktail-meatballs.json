Place all the meatball ingredients into a large mixing bowl and, using your hands, mix together until blended (but don\u2019t overmix).\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nWith wet hands (to keep the meatballs from sticking), form 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoon-sized meatballs. (Using a 1/2 ounce portion scoop makes this easier but you can also do it by eye.) Place balls about an inch apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake meatballs until just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nFor the Glaze:\nMeanwhile, combine all glaze ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, and cook until mixture is slightly thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside and let cool.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nTo Serve:\nBrush glaze onto meatballs and top with scallions and sesame seeds. Serve with extra hoisin glaze on the side for dipping.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nThe meatballs can be formed and cooked in advance. To serve, reheat for 10 minutes in a 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) oven, then brush with glaze. For best results, use pork and beef, though they can be made with 100% beef if you like. Meatballs and glaze recipes can be scaled up or down with no changes.\nHors D'Oeuvres\nChinese\nRoasting\nGround Beef\nPork"
