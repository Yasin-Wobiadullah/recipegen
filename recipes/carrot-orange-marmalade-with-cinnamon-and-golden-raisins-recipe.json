Wash the oranges and remove rind in quarters. Scrape away as much of the white pith as possible. Thinly slice rind lengthwise, then roughly chop crosswise into smaller pieces. Transfer rind to a large pot and add baking soda, and 2 1/2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, coarsely chop oranges and remove any seeds. Transfer oranges to a food processor and pulse until orange pieces are broken up but still chunky, about 8 pulses. Add oranges and carrots to pot with the rind and bring to a simmer. Simmer, covered, 10 minutes.\nMeasure the mixture. You should have about 6 cups. If you have less, add a bit more water. If you have more, discard the extra.) Stir in raisins, lemon juice, calcium water, cinnamon, and butter, and return to a boil. Stir in sugar-pectin mixture and return mixture to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly. Boil hard for 1 minute.\nRemove pot from heat and skim any foam from the surface of the marmalade with a cold metal spoon. Ladle marmalade into hot sterilized jars and process them in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.\nJams & Jellies"
