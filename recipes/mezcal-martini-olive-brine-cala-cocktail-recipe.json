If you can't find them, consider halving the olive brine and adding more to taste, as salt levels vary drastically. If you don't have Mandarine Napol\u00e9on, you can substitute Cointreau or Pierre Ferrand Dry Cura\u00e7ao. Bar Keep Fennel Bitters are available where cocktail bitters are sold, and online. If you can't find them, the drink is also tasty with orange bitters instead.\nMezcal\nMexican\nCinco de Mayo\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
