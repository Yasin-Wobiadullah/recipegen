  "full_text": "The Best Fried Chicken Recipe Ever?\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n80 mins\nBrining and Marinating Time\n16 hrs\nTotal\n17 hrs 25 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\nkosher salt\n(do not use table salt for brining)\n2\nquarts\nwater\n1\n(\n3-pound)\nchicken\n, cut into\n8\npieces\n1\nquart\nbuttermilk\n1\npound\nlard\n1\nstick\nunsalted butter\n1/2\ncup\ncountry ham pieces\n, or 1 thick slice country ham cut into 1/2-inch strips\n1\ncup\nall-purpose flour\n2\ntablespoons\ncornstarch\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n1/2\nteaspoon\nground black pepper\nDirections\nTo make the brine: Stir kosher salt into cold water until dissolved. Place chicken parts in a nonreactive bowl or pot; add enough brine to cover completely. Refrigerate 8 to 12 hours.\nDrain the brined chicken and rinse out the bowl it was brined in. Return chicken to the bowl, and pour the buttermilk over. Cover and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Drain the chicken on a wire rack, discarding the buttermilk.\nMeanwhile, prepare the fat for frying by putting the lard, butter and country ham into a heavy skillet or frying pan. Cook over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, skimming as needed, until the butter ceases to throw off foam and the country ham is browned. Use a slotted spoon to remove the ham carefully from the fat.\nJust before frying, increase the temperature to medium-high and heat the fat to 335 degrees. Prepare the dredge by blending together the flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl or on wax paper. Dredge the drained chicken pieces thoroughly in the flour mixture, then pat well to remove all excess flour.\nUsing tongs, slip some of the chicken pieces, skin side down, into the heated fat. (Do not overcrowd the pan or the cooking fat will cool. Fry in batches, if necessary.) Regulate the fat so it just bubbles, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on each side, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Drain thoroughly on a wire rack or on crumpled paper towels, and serve.\nFried chicken is delicious eaten hot, warm, at room temperature or cold.\nChicken Mains\nFried Chicken\nWhole Chicken",
