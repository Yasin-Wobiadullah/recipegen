In a medium bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together sour cream, buttermilk, eggs, 3 tablespoons melted butter, and canola oil. Pour wet ingredients into bowl with dry ingredients and whisk until completely combined. Stir in cheese and jalape\u00f1os.\nUsing pot holders, carefully remove hot pan from oven. Place 1 tablespoon butter in skillet and swirl to completely melt and coat inside of pan. Pour in cornbread batter and place in oven. Bake until skewer inserted into middle of cornbread comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 5 minutes, then carefully turn out to wire rack and let cool an additional 10 minutes. Serve immediately. Reheat any leftover cornbread before serving again.\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron skillet\nNotes\nSeeding the jalape\u00f1os results in a mild heat. For a spicier cornbread, the seeds can be left in. For an even less spicy cornbread, pepper jack can be substituted for regular Monterey Jack cheese or cheddar.\nRead More\nMaple and Walnut Cornbread\nOrange and Cranberry Cornbread\nRoasted Pepper Cornbread\nCheddar, Bacon, and Scallion Cornbread\nCheese\nCornbread\nThanksgiving Side Dishes"
