Drain in a colander, rinse under cold running water, and let drip dry. Set aside. (If they being to clump or stick, run under cold water again to loosen.)\nSerious Eats / Shao Z.\nMeanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, stir together soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, water, grated ginger, sesame oil, hot oil, and toasted sesame seeds. Set dressing aside in the refrigerator to chill.\nIn a saucepan of simmering salted water, poach shrimp until just cooked through, about 3 minutes.

Remove from skillet, let cool 1 minute, then roll and thinly slice into strips.\nSerious Eats / Shao Z.\nTo serve, place chilled drained noodles in serving bowls. Top the noodle with shrimp, corn, scallion, ham, tomato, crab stick, and sliced egg. Add a dollop of hot Japanese mustard in the middle. Divide dressing into 4 small bowls and serve. To eat, pour dressing on top of the noodles at the table, toss to combine, and enjoy right away.\nNotes\nRamen noodles are often available at stores with well-stocked Asian sections, usually in the refrigerator or freezer section (they're sometimes sold alone, and sometimes sold with a soup flavor pack included). If you can't find ramen noodles, you can substitute yakisoba or soba noodles; the dish won't be the same, but it'll still be tasty. Alternatively, you can transform\nangel hair pasta into a worthy ramen substitute using Daniel's method\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe noodles and toppings can be prepared hours ahead of time. Simply refrigerate and assemble when ready to serve.\nRead More\nClassic Cold Soba Recipe\nBibim Guksu (Korean Cold Mixed Noodles) Recipe\nChinese Cold Noodle Salad with Sesame Dressing Recipe\nItalian Seafood-Salad Pasta Salad With Vietnamese Noodles Recipe\nMul Naengmyun (Cold Korean Noodle Soup) Recipe\nRamen\nJapanese\nHam\nShrimp\nNoodle Mains",
