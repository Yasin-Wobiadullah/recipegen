Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Scatter two-thirds of onions, carrots, celery, and thyme sprigs across pan. Place a wire rack directly on top of vegetables.\nUsing a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, combine paprika, cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, dried thyme, and dried oregano. Chop or crush to a powder.\nPat turkey dry with paper towels. Rub turkey all over with spice rub. Rub 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil all over turkey, then season liberally on all surfaces with salt and black pepper. (If using a brined, salted, or kosher turkey, omit salting step; see note.) Tuck wing tips behind back. Place turkey on top of rack, arranging so that it does not overlap the edges, pressing down on breastbone to flatten breasts slightly.\nTransfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into deepest part of breast registers 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) and thighs register at least 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), about 1 hour 20 minutes.\nWhile turkey roasts, make jus. Roughly chop reserved neck, backbone, and giblets. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a 3-quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, about 5 minutes longer. Add chicken stock, remaining thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Simmer until reduced by half, about 40 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a 2-quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from surface of broth. Season jus to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm.\nWhen turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and discard. Whisk juices into jus.\nCarve turkey and serve with jus.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\n,\nspice grinder\nor\nmortar and pestle\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nFor best results, dry-brine your turkey by\nfollowing the instructions here\n. If dry-brining, omit any extra salt added to the turkey in step 3.\nRead More\nSpatchcocked (Butterflied) Roast Turkey With Gravy Recipe\nThe Best Simple Roast Turkey With Gravy Recipe\nPorchetta-Flavored Spatchcocked Turkey Recipe\nChinese Red-Sauce-Glazed Spatchcocked Turkey Recipe\nCajun-Style Smoked Turkey Recipe\nThe Food Lab's Definitive Guide to Buying, Prepping, Cooking, and Carving Your Holiday Turkey\nThe Right Way to Brine Turkey\nTurkey Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nRoasted Turkey\nWhole Turkey\nThanksgiving Turkeys"
