Toast pecans on a half-sheet pan until golden brown, about 10 minutes, then let cool completely. (The pecans may be toasted in advance and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for several weeks.) Meanwhile,\npeel, trim, and core\nthe pineapple and measure 5 ounces (about 2/3 cup; 140g) fruit into the jar of a blender, or a tall, narrow jar if using an immersion blender. If you like, reserve the pineapple scraps to make\nfresh pineapple syrup\n. Peel banana and measure out 3 ounces fruit (about 1/3 cup; 85g) to add along with the pineapple. Blend until smooth. Use pur\u00e9e immediately or refrigerate up to 3 days and bring to about 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) before use.\nFor the Cake:\nCombine sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves, baking soda, nutmeg, eggs, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and whip until thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add melted butter in a steady stream, then reduce speed to low and add flour. Once smooth, add fruit pur\u00e9e and mix only until well combined. Fold in toasted pecans with a flexible spatula, scraping the bowl along the bottom and sides to ensure batter is well mixed throughout. Transfer batter to a lightly greased 10-inch cast-iron skillet.\nBake until the cake is well risen and golden brown, about 45 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center will have a few crumbs still attached when removed, and your fingertip will leave a slight indentation in the puffy crust. Transfer to a heat-safe surface or a wire rack and cool until no trace of warmth remains, at least 90 minutes. (The time will vary depending on the cast iron's gauge and the type of cooling surface.)\nTo Finish:\nTop the cake with about 2 cups of your favorite cream cheese frosting or buttercream, along with a scattering of toasted pecans. Enjoy immediately or leave at room temperature until ready to serve, up to 24 hours at cool room temperature. After cutting, wrap leftover slices individually and store at cool room temperature up to 2 days more.\nSpecial equipment\nImmersion blender\n,\nstand mixer\n,\n10-inch cast iron skillet\nNotes\nThose who don't like cream cheese frosting can reserve the pineapple core and scraps to make\nfresh pineapple syrup\n. This in turn can be made into a pineapple variation on\nLemon Chantilly\n, for a bright and tangy topping without cream cheese.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFresh Pineapple Is the Key to This Cast Iron Skillet Hummingbird Cake\nCakes\nBanana\nPineapple\nPecans",
