Knead and squeeze salted sprouts, softening them and releasing their liquid, about 2 minutes. Juice tangerine, reserving half of peel for zesting later, and add juice to salted sprouts. Toss to coat, cover, then transfer to refrigerator for at least 15 minutes and up to 4 hours.\nIn a small bowl, combine shallot, Dijon, vinegar, and finely grated zest of reserved tangerine peel. Whisk in olive oil, season with salt and pepper, then set aside.\nIn a small skillet, toast hazelnuts over medium-high heat, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until skins are just beginning to take on a light roasted, campfire smell, about 4 minutes. Let cool slightly. Transfer nuts to a zipper-lock bag, then gently crush under the weight of a heavy pan or skillet to form large broken chunks.\nRemove salted sprouts from refrigerator. Knead and squeeze once more, then drain and squeeze well to remove any excess moisture. Transfer to a serving bowl. Toss with remaining shredded raw Brussels sprouts and toasted hazelnuts. Whisk dressing, then drizzle all over salad. (Add just enough dressing to lightly coat everything in the salad bowl; you may have a small amount left over.) Season with salt and pepper, then add crumbled goat cheese, toss gently to combine, and serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nMandoline slicer\nNotes\nWhen toasting the hazelnuts, be careful not to burn them or darken them to the point of developing an unpleasant flavor. Stir and shake the pan constantly until the nuts are lightly toasted.\nBrussels Sprouts\nSalads\nVegetarian\nFall\nFall Salads"
