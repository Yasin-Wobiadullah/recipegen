Transfer spices to a granite mortar and pestle or spice grinder along with white peppercorns and salt. Allow to cool slightly, and peel and discard husks from cardamom pods. Grind to a fine powder. If using a spice grinder, transfer mixture to a granite mortar and pestle.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd half the serrano chiles to the mortar and pound until slightly broken down, making sure to keep the pestle as close to the chiles as possible to avoid splattering chile juices over yourself. Add remaining serrano chiles and pound to a coarse paste, about 3 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nPounding thoroughly between each addition to break down and incorporate ingredients into the paste (3 to 4 minutes of pounding per addition) add in the following order: Thai chiles; makrut lime zest (if using); galangal; lemongrass; coriander root; shallots and garlic; and shrimp paste. It should take about 25 minutes total to pound ingredients into a very fine paste. Use right away or transfer curry paste to an airtight container, covering paste with plastic wrap pressed directly onto its surface to prevent it from drying out, and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nGranite mortar and pestle\nNotes\nThai or Chinese white cardamom can be found in Southeast and East Asian markets or online. Its flavor is both more floral and subdued than green cardamom's.\nGalangal is a rhizome and an integral part of basic red curry pastes. If you are in the US, it's usually best to peel it before slicing as most of what we get is mature galangal, which is very tough to work with. While galangal looks like ginger, they are not interchangeable, as their flavors are very different.\nFresh makrut limes can be hard to find in the US. You can order them online, though they are a seasonal product and may not always be available (note that they are often sold under a different name that we avoid using, as it is a\nderogatory term in some contexts\n); you may also be able to find them in the freezer section at Southeast Asian markets. Makrut lime zest freezes well. If you cannot find makrut lime, you are better off omitting it, as the more common Persian lime and other citrus are not good substitutes.\nThe roots of fresh coriander (a.k.a. cilantro) provide a slight herbal note to curry pastes, but unfortunately they're hard to find in the US, as they are often cut off from the stems before cilantro is brought to market (though local farmers markets in the summer and fall often have coriander with the roots still attached). Coriander roots can be found at Southeast Asian markets. If you can't find the herb with the roots still attached, you can either use the tender stems of fresh cilantro, which won't make too much of a difference in this particular curry, or omit it altogether. And, to clarify, although they are called coriander \"roots,\" Thai cooks usually also use some of the tender green stem.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nCurry paste can be refrigerated in an airtight container, with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the paste to prevent it from drying out, for up to 1 week, or frozen for up to 3 months.\nThai\nThe Latest"
