Whisk in cream and milk until yolk mixture is fully incorporated.\nPlace pot over medium-low heat and cook, whisking frequently, until a custard forms on a spoon and a finger swiped across the back leaves a clean line, or until custard temperature reaches 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C). Stir in salt and vanilla.\nSerious Eats / Max Falkowitz\nStrain custard through a fine mesh strainer and chill in either ice bath or refrigerator until it is very cold, about 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Churn in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions, then serve right away or transfer to an airtight container and chill in freezer for 1 hour to let custard firm up slightly. Serve custard within 2 hours of it being made (see note).\nSerious Eats / Max Falkowitz\nOptional:\nTo make concrete-style drinks, finely chop up ingredients like M&M's, heath bars, cookies, or pretzels and store in freezer, then add to ice cream machine during last 2 minutes of churning. Serve right away in a glass or cup with a straw and a long spoon.\nSerious Eats / Robyn Lee\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant-read thermometer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n,\nice cream maker\nNotes\nFor the softest, creamiest results, eat the custard within two hours of churning. This recipe can be easily doubled, but take caution to only make as much custard as you'll serve in one sitting.\nRead More\nSoft and Rich Chocolate Frozen Custard Recipe\nNew England\u2013Style Frozen Custard Recipe\nAn Illustrated Tour of Ice Cream Styles Around the World\nIce Cream\nHeavy Cream"
