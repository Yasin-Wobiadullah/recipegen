Cook bacon in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until fat renders and bacon crisps, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour bacon fat out into a small bowl. Return 2 tablespoons to pan and place pan in oven. Reserve an additional 2 tablespoons fat and discard the rest or save for another use.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together sour cream, buttermilk, eggs, 3 tablespoons melted butter, and 2 tablespoons reserved bacon fat. Pour wet ingredients into bowl with dry ingredients and whisk until completely combined. Stir in bacon, cheese, and scallions.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nUsing pot holders, carefully remove hot pan from oven. Pour in cornbread batter and place in oven. Bake until skewer inserted into middle of cornbread comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 5 minutes, then carefully turn out to wire rack and let cool an additional 10 minutes. Serve immediately. Reheat any leftover cornbread before serving again.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron skillet\nNotes\nThis recipe results in a sweet and savory cornbread. For less sweetness, the sugar can be cut by half.\nRead More\nMaple and Walnut Cornbread\nOrange and Cranberry Cornbread\nJalape\u00f1o Jack Cornbread\nRoasted Pepper Cornbread\nSides\nCornbread\nCheddar Cheese\nBacon\nCornmeal",
