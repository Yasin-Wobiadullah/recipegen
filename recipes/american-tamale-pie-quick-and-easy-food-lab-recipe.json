Heat butter in a 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium heat until melted. Continue to cook, swirling pan gently until butter is nutty-smelling and solids are a toasty brown. Transfer to a heatproof cup or bowl and reserve for Brown Butter Cornbread Crust.\nReturn pan to high heat. Add beef and cook, stirring and breaking up with a wooden spoon or a potato masher until starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add chile powder, cayenne (if using), cumin, and coriander. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nAdd corn, black beans, tomatoes, and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, then stir in cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened into a rich stew-like consistency, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in scallions and cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nFor the Brown Butter Cornbread Crust:\nIn a large bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, baking powder, and baking soda. In a second bowl, combine eggs, sour cream, and buttermilk and whisk until homogenous. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in reserved browned butter. Whisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients until homogenous.\nUsing a large spoon, place small dollops of the cornbread batter mixture on top of the beef filling, then use the back of the spoon to spread it into an even layer. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until pale golden brown and a skewer inserted into the cornbread comes out clean, about 20 minutes.\nLet cool 15 minutes, then serve with sour cream.\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron skillet\nRead More\nTamale Pie With Braised Skirt Steak, Charred Corn, and Brown Butter Cornbread Crust\nChili\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nGround Beef\nQuick Dinners"
