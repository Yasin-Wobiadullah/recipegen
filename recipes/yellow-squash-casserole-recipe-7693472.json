Lightly grease a 2 1/2-quart baking dish with unsalted butter and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nIn a 10-inch nonstick pan or cast iron skillet set over medium-low heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Scrape onto a plate and set aside. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in skillet and, working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, add the squash and cook, stirring to coat in butter, until squash begins to soften around the edges, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking until squash is tender, about 8 minutes. Transfer cooked squash to a bowl and set aside. Repeat with remaining squash, adding 2 tablespoons butter for each additional batch.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nIn a large bowl, whisk together sour cream, eggs, and cream cheese until well-combined. Using a silicone spatula, fold in the cheddar and mozzarella. Drain cooked squash of any pooled liquid, then add to sour cream mixture with reserved onion and garlic. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour squash mixture into prepared baking dish and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nFor the Topping:\nIn a medium bowl, toss crushed Ritz crackers with the melted butter.
