Sprinkle pork belly all over with sugar-and-salt mixture, then shake off any excess. Place in a zip-top bag and store in the refrigerator at least 8 and up to 24 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the\nTare\n, at Least 8 and up to 24 Hours Before Cooking:\nCombine kombu and water for the tare in a covered container and store in the refrigerator at least 8 and up to 24 hours.\nFor the Broth\n: Place chicken in a pressure cooker and cover with 6 1/4 cups (1.5L) water. (No matter what, be sure not to exceed the max-fill line of your cooker.) Rinse cured pork belly of salt and sugar, then add to pot, nestling it on top (the pork belly does not have to be submerged). Cover pressure cooker, bring to low pressure, and cook for 40 minutes. Allow pressure cooker to depressurize naturally.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large heatproof bowl, combine leek, onion, carrot, garlic, and ginger. Using tongs and a spatula, carefully transfer pork belly to a plate or rimmed baking sheet. Carefully pour broth through a fine-mesh strainer into the bowl of chopped vegetables. (Reserve all chicken bones and meat for a second broth, if desired; see notes.) Stir broth once, then add the kombu for the broth and stir again. Let broth steep for 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStrain broth into a large, clean mixing bowl, then decant into pint or other storage containers. (Reserve chopped vegetables and kombu for a second broth, if desired; see notes.) Cover containers and place in refrigerator.\nFor the Tare:\nTransfer kombu and its soaking water to a medium saucepan and bring to a bare simmer over medium-high heat. Remove from heat and add katsuobushi flakes. Let dashi steep 3 minutes.\nStrain dashi into a small mixing bowl through a cheesecloth- or coffee filter\u2013lined fine-mesh strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. You should have about 1 1/2 cups (350ml) of dashi. If you have less than that, top up with water to make 1 1/2 cups (350ml).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a saucepan, combine dashi with sake and soy sauce and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer and cook until reduced by half, or until you have about 2 1/4 cups (525ml) of liquid. Transfer to a heatproof container and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Aroma Oil:\nScoop off the top layer of congealed fat from the broth and place it in a saucepan over medium-low heat. (Don't worry if some broth gets in there, too.) You should have about 1/2 cup (120ml) rendered fat; if you do not, either add a handful of small pieces of solid fat trimmed from the cooked pork belly and cook it in the rendered fat until it renders enough additional fat to make 1/2 cup (120ml), or supplement with a neutral oil like vegetable oil. (If you add extra fat from the belly, there's no need to remove it until you strain in the next step.)\nWhen the fat is hot, add sliced garlic and minced ginger. Saut\u00e9 until fragrant, but not brown. Place lemon zest in the bottom of a fine-mesh strainer set over a heatproof bowl. Pour the hot aroma oil through the strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much fat as possible; discard solids. Set aroma oil aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Assemble the Ramen Bowls:\nBring a large pot of unsalted water to boil over high heat. Place broth in a separate pot and bring to a simmer over high heat; try not to let the broth boil, as boiling will make it more opaque. Set out containers of tare, aroma oil, and freshly ground white pepper, along with appropriate measuring spoons and serving bowls, and make sure all garnishes and toppings are close at hand.\nLadle 5 ounces (150ml) boiling water into each serving bowl to warm it. After 30 seconds, place noodles in the pot of boiling water and stir vigorously with chopsticks or tongs to prevent sticking.\nDiscard water in serving bowls. Place 2 tablespoons (30ml) tare, 2 teaspoons (10ml) aroma oil, 1/8 teaspoon white pepper, and a pinch of sliced scallions in the bottom of each serving bowl. Add about 1 1/2 cups (350ml) hot broth to each bowl.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen noodles are cooked, drain them thoroughly using a fine-mesh strainer or noodle basket, shaking off as much excess water as possible, then place a serving of noodles in each bowl of hot broth. Stir noodles with chopsticks or tongs, then lift and fold noodles over. Garnish with sliced pork belly, more scallions, ajitsuke tamago (if using), and whatever other toppings you have at hand. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric or stovetop\npressure cooker\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n, noodle basket (optional)\nNotes\nThis recipe is meant to be used in conjunction with our\nmiso tori paitan recipe\n\u2014the chicken used to make this broth, as well as the kombu and vegetables that are steeped in the broth, can and should be used to make the\nniban tori paitan broth\nin that recipe.\nIt's preferable that the pork belly be skinless. If the skin is on, remove by chilling the pork belly thoroughly and carefully slicing off the skin with a sharp knife. The skin can be placed in the pot, if you like, but it can also be discarded or used for another purpose.\nCutting up the chicken helps with the extraction of flavor and gelatin, particularly given the short cook time for the broth.\nChilling the cooked pork belly thoroughly will make cutting it into serving portions far easier. If it is a particularly fatty piece of meat, or particularly soft, freeze the belly for about 15 minutes before portioning. The appearance and flavor of the cooked pork belly is vastly improved by torching or broiling prior to serving.\nIf you choose to buy store-bought noodles, we recommend the No. 20 Kaedama from Sun Noodle. You can also ask at your favorite local ramen shop if they will sell you noodles; try to buy long, thin, wavy noodles for this recipe.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe broth, tare, and aroma oil will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Frozen, they will keep for up to 3 months, although the tare's flavor will degrade slightly (the broth and aroma oil will hold up better). The pork belly, if wrapped well in plastic wrap, will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator; tightly wrapped and placed in a freezer bag, it will keep for up to 3 months in the freezer with little to no decline in quality.\nRead More\nHomemade Ramen Noodles\nPressure Cooker Pork Belly Chashu\nMiso Tori Paitan Ramen (Creamy Chicken Broth Ramen)\nChicken Paitan Broth ( Tori Paitan Dashi)\nRamen\nJapanese\nPressure Cooker\nWhole Chicken\nPork Belly",
