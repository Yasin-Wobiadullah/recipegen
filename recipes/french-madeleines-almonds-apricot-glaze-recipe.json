Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until foaming subsides and butter starts to smell nutty and milk solids are a deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour brown butter into a heatproof container and set aside to cool.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk 1 egg with the sugar until pale yellow and thickened slightly, about 2 minutes. Add flour, baking powder, and salt, and whisk until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining egg until the batter looks smooth. Add milk to the cooled (but still melted) brown butter and drizzle the mixture into the batter, whisking continuously. Whisk in the vanilla and almond extracts. Cover and set the batter aside for 50 minutes at room temperature, then refrigerate for 10 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 390\u00b0F and adjust oven rack to middle position. Butter a madeleine pan and divide the batter evenly among the molds, filling them almost to the top. (There\u2019s no need to smooth the batter, as it will even out as it bakes.) Sprinkle the shaved almonds on top. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 9 to 11 minutes.\nRemove madeleines from the oven and immediately invert the hot pan over a cool baking sheet or a wire rack, gently rapping the pan to dislodge the madeleines. (Waiting for the madeleines to cool even slightly will make it difficult to remove them from the pan.) Set the madeleines aside to cool slightly.\nFor the Glaze:\nCombine jam and water in a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until the jam loosens and melts into the water. Remove from the heat. Using a pastry brush, brush the shell-side of the madeleines with the glaze.\nServe warm or at room temperature. Madeleines taste best on the day they\u2019re made, but you can keep them, stored in an airtight container, for up to 2 days.\nSpecial equipment\n16-cup madeleine pan\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMadeleines: Fancy French Cookie-Sized Cakes That Are Easy to Make at Home\nCakes\nFrench\nBaking\nApricot\nAlmonds"
