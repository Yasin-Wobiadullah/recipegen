Halve or quarter and juice one grapefruit; set aside others for juicing later. Pour juice into a sealable container and refrigerate. Cut juiced grapefruit rind into 1-inch chunks. Toss with sugar in a large nonreactive mixing bowl, cover tightly with plastic, and let stand at room temperature, stirring once every 45 minutes or so, until sugar has completely dissolved, about 3 hours. (You can let the mixture stand up to 12 hours, if desired.)\nMeasure reserved grapefruit juice and juice additional grapefruits to yield 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) of fresh juice. Add to sugar mixture along with lemon juice and stir well, then strain through a nonreactive fine-mesh strainer or piece of cheesecloth into a glass or ceramic container. At this point, the concentrated grapefruit syrup can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.\nWhen ready to serve, add sparkling water to concentrated grapefruit syrup. Adjust to taste with additional sparkling water, grapefruit, or lemon juice; bear in mind that a tart soda tastes best when mixed with beer.\nFor Each Radler:\nAdd beer and Grapefruit Soda to a 16-ounce pint glass. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nCheesecloth or nonreactive\nfine-mesh strainer\n, 2-quart pitcher\nNotes\nOur favorite version of this radler starts with pilsner, but feel free to experiment with other types of beer.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make a Radler (Shandy), a Great Citrus-Beer Drink to Beat the Heat\nBeer\nGrapefruit\nFather's Day\nSummer Drinks",
