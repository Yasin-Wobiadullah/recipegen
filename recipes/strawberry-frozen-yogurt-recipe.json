Cook, stirring occasionally, until juices leave the berries and begin to simmer, about 4 minutes, then reduce heat to low. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until juices thicken slightly and berries are very tender, about 7 minutes.\nTransfer to a blender or food processor (or use an immersion blender in saucepan) and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer. You should have about 2 cups of strained strawberry pur\u00e9e.\nTransfer pur\u00e9e to a bowl and whisk in yogurt until well combined. If base tastes too sweet, add lemon juice to taste, starting with 1/4 teaspoon, bearing in mind that sweetness and acidity will both be slightly muted when chilled. Chill in refrigerator until very cold, about 3 hours.\nChurn in ice cream machine according to manufacturer's instructions. Enjoy immediately as soft serve, or firm up in freezer for 2 to 3 hours. Once set, frozen yogurt will be firm; defrost on counter for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream machine\n,\nblender\nor\nfood processor\n,\nvegetable peeler\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nWhen removing lemon zest with a vegetable peeler, take care not to remove too much of the white pith underneath.\nRead More\nRaspberry-Campari Frozen Yogurt Recipe\nBlackberry Brown Sugar Frozen Yogurt Recipe\nThe Best Strawberry Ice Cream Recipe\nStrawberry Sorbet Recipe\nIce Cream\nAmerican\nStrawberry",
