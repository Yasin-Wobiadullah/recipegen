In a medium or large pot of salted boiling water, cook spinach until lightly wilted but still vibrantly green, about 30 seconds. Immediately transfer spinach to prepared ice bath to rapidly chill.\nOnce spinach is fully chilled, drain it; empty the ice bath bowl, wipe it dry, and set aside. Using clean hands, wring out as much water from spinach as possible, doing your best not to mangle and tear the greens. Transfer to cutting board, and cut into bite-size pieces. Set aside.\nIn the now-empty large bowl, whisk together rice wine vinegar, doenjang, honey, fish sauce, black pepper, and garlic. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in sesame oil until emulsified.\nUsing clean hands, fold spinach into dressing, separating any clumps and gently massaging dressing into greens until spinach is evenly coated all over, about 30 seconds. Add scallions and sesame seeds, and using hands, fold into spinach until well-combined, about 15 seconds. Taste, and adjust seasoning with additional salt if needed. Divide between small individual serving bowls, or transfer to airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\nNotes\nMature spinach, whether curly or flat-leaf, is critical for this dish. Avoid baby spinach at all costs, which turns mushy when cooked.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe marinated spinach can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before serving.\nRead More\nCelebrate the Sides With a Korean-American Banchan Thanksgiving\nOi Muchim (Korean Marinated Cucumber Banchan)\nGamja Bokkeum (Korean Sweet Soy-Glazed Potatoes)\nGaji-Namul (Korean Marinated Eggplant Banchan)\nSpinach\nKorean\nVegetarian Sides\nVegetable Sides\nQuick Sides"
