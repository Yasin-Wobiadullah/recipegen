Place the stomachs in a large bowl and add 3 tablespoons of white vinegar. Wash the stomachs in the water and vinegar by vigorously rubbing the folds of the stomachs against one another. Rinse and repeat.\nIn the meantime, bring a pot of water to boil. Place the pre-washed stomachs in the water and boil for 5 minutes, until the water turns white and cloudy and scum rises to the top. Remove the stomachs from the dirty water and rinse them again under cold running water.\nLet the stomachs cool for a minute or so. Chop the stomach into 1/2-inch squares and place them into a medium soup pot.\nAdd the rest of the ingredients for simmering. Fill the pot with water to completely cover the pieces of stomachs by 2 inches.\nSimmer for 3 to 4 hours, until the pieces of stomachs are tender. Every half hour or so, monitor the pot to make sure that the water hasn't boiled all the way down, adding more water as necessary. Towards the end, taste a piece of the stomach and adjust the salt as needed. Remember that you'll be serving the stomach with plenty of garnishes, so it needs to be aggressively flavored but not too salty.\nStrain stomach from liquid and brown in batches in a cast iron skillet with a small amount of oil. Serve with your choice of tortillas and garnishes.\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron skillet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nLeftovers may be kept in the refrigerator for up to a week and reheated. Freeze for longer storage.\nRead More\nTacos de Lengua Recipe\nTacos de Castac\u00e1n Con Queso (Yucatecan Pork Belly and Cheese Tacos) Recipe\nPork Sorpotel (Goan Pork Offal Stew) Recipe\nStewed Pork Bung (Large Intestine)\nTacos\nMexican\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork\nCinco de Mayo"
