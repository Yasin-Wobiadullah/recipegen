Toss broccoli with 2 tablespoons olive oil and spread in an even layer on 2 rimmed baking sheets. Transfer to oven and roast until broccoli is tender and browned, about 25 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nIn a Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon coriander seed and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nAdd roasted broccoli, buttermilk, and just enough stock to barely cover vegetables. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat. Working in batches if necessary, transfer vegetables and liquid to a blender. Starting on the lowest speed and gradually increasing to the highest speed, blend broccoli until a smooth puree forms. Drizzle in 4 tablespoons total olive oil while blender is running and return to a clean pot. Add as much of the remaining vegetable stock as necessary to thin to a creamy soup consistency. Season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nMeanwhile, lower oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). In a mixing bowl, toss pepitas with 2 tablespoons olive oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander, cumin, mustard seed, and turmeric. Season with salt. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and roast until fragrant, about 10 minutes. Let cool.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nScrape toasted spiced pepitas into a mixing bowl and stir in parsley, lemon zest, and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.\nWarm the soup, then spoon it into bowls. Top with spiced pepitas and some of their oil. Serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nblender\n,\n2 rimmed baking sheets\nNotes\nAs a shortcut, you can substitute the spices used for the pepitas with an equal amount of store-bought curry powder. If the store-bought curry powder is salted, be sure to taste pepitas before adding salt.\nRead More\nBroccoli Cheese Soup Recipe\nCreamy Cauliflower and Bacon Soup Recipe\nThe Best Potato-Leek Soup Recipe\nClassic Creamy Carrot Soup Recipe\nHow to Make Creamy Vegetable Soups Without a Recipe\nVegetarian Mains\nRoasting\nButtermilk\nPumpkin Seeds\nBroccoli",
