Drain and squeeze out excess water from mushrooms. Chop mushrooms into small pieces. (You should have about 2 tablespoons chopped mushrooms.)\nSerious Eats/ Vy Tran\nIn a large bowl, combine pork, chopped mushrooms, scallions, 1 tablespoon shallot, half of the garlic, salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, and freshly ground pepper. Mix well with spoon or hands and set aside for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats/ Vy Tran\nWhile the meat mixture sits, with a sharp knife, cut 6 tomatoes in half crosswise. Use a small metal spoon to gently scoop out pulp, seeds, and juice into a bowl. Chop pulp and remaining 1 tomato and add to bowl with seeds and juice. Dry insides of now-empty tomato halves with paper towels.\nSerious Eats/ Vy Tran\nUse a small metal spoon to scoop pork mixture into tomato halves and press firmly, making sure to get filling into crevices.\nSerious Eats/ Vy Tran\nIn a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tomatoes, meat-side down, and sear, without moving, until the meat forms a golden-brown crust, about 5 minutes. Using a thin spatula, carefully remove tomatoes from pan and transfer to a large plate, meat-side up.\nSerious Eats/ Vy Tran\nLower heat to medium. Add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and remaining shallot to skillet and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomato pulp, 1/2 cup water, fish sauce, and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats/ Vy Tran\nTurn heat down to medium-low, add tomatoes back to pan, meat-side up. Simmer partially covered, occasionally spooning sauce over the tomatoes with a metal spoon, until pork filling is cooked through and registers at least 140\u2109 (60\u2103), 8 to 14 minutes. Tomatoes should be soft but maintain their shape. Use a thin spatula to carefully transfer cooked tomatoes to a serving platter.\nSerious Eats/ Vy Tran\nIncrease heat to medium and cook sauce until glossy and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Spoon sauce over tomatoes. Garnish with cilantro and freshly ground pepper, and serve with jasmine rice.\nSerious Eats/ Vy Tran\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge nonstick skillet, thin spatula\nNotes\nDehydrated wood ear mushrooms can be found in most Asian food markets.\nIt\u2019s important to use tomatoes that are all roughly the same size to ensure a similar rate of cooking. If you\u2019re using larger tomatoes, the cooking time will be slightly different. I recommend vine on tomatoes, such as Beefsteak, Cherokee purple, Ozark Pink, or Berkeley Tie-dye pink.\nFor the fish sauce, I recommend using 3 Crab or Red Boat brands.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe filling can be made 2 days ahead and stored in a lidded container in the fridge.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nRecipes By Ingredients\nVietnamese\nSummer Mains",
