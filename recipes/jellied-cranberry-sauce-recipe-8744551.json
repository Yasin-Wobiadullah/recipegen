  "full_text": "Jellied Cranberry Sauce\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n60 mins\nChilling Time\n4 hrs\nTotal\n5 hrs 5 mins\nServes\n16\nMakes\n2 Cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3 cups fresh or\nfrozen cranberries\n(12 ounces;\n340\ng)\n1 1/4 cups (\n300\nml)\nwater\n1 1/4\ncups\ngranulated sugar\n(8 3/4 ounces; 250g)\n1\nteaspoon\ngrated\norange zest\nand/or grated fresh ginger (optional)\nDirections\nPlace two small plates in the freezer to chill. In a large saucepan, combine cranberries and water. Bring to boil over medium-high heat.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nReduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula, until cranberries soften and skins burst, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSet a food mill over a large heatproof bowl. Process cranberry mixture through food mill, discarding skins. (If you don\u2019t have a food mill, transfer mixture to a blender and blend until smooth, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl.)\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nReturn cranberry pur\u00e9e to now-empty saucepan. Stir in sugar and orange zest and/or ginger (if using) and stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot often, until mixture thickens and reaches 217 to 221\u00b0F (103 to 105\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 10 to 15 minutes\n(mixture may spatter as it cooks down; reduce heat to medium-low if needed). Skim and remove any foam that rises to the top while cooking. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nTo test if jelly is set,\nspoon about 1 teaspoon sauce onto chilled plate. Return to freezer for 1 minute to cool to room temperature. Run your finger through mixture on plate; if clear trail is left behind without closing up and mixture wrinkles when pushed, then the sauce is set. If not, return mixture to boil and continue to cook until thickened, 2 to 5 minutes, then repeat plate test with remaining chilled plate.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nPour cranberry sauce into 2-cup mold, small 2-cup capacity bowl, or a clean, empty 15-ounce can.\nLet cool at room temperature until just warm, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nCover sauce with plastic wrap and transfer to refrigerator. Chill until firm, at least 4 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nWhen ready to serve, remove plastic wrap, then run a small offset spatula or butter knife down sides of mold to gently loosen sauce from edges of mold and break suction. Place a flat plate or platter on top of mold. Invert quickly to release sauce, rapping plate or platter sharply on counter if\u00a0needed to release. (If cranberry sauce still sticks in mold, re-invert, gently loosen sides, and try again.) Slice if desired and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge saucepan, rubber spatula, food mill (or blender and fine-mesh strainer), instant-read thermometer, 2-cup jelly mold (or small bowl or clean, empty 15-ounce can)\nNotes\nIf you\u2019re using frozen cranberries, there\u2019s no need to thaw them before cooking.\nWarm spices like cinnamon, allspice, cloves, or cardamom also pair well with cranberry sauce. If you\u2019d like to add a spice to this dish, either in combination with the orange or ginger or alone, start by adding 1/4 teaspoon of a ground spice at the beginning of step 4, taste at the end of that step, and add more as desired. Spice blends like pumpkin pie spice, apple pie spice, five-spice powder, or garam masala would all be fun here as well.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe sauce can be made through the end of step 7 and refrigerated for up to 4 days before serving.\nCondiments & Sauces\nThe Latest\nHolidays & Seasons\nThanksgiving Side Dishes\nThanksgiving",
