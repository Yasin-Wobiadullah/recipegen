Whisking constantly, drizzle in all but 1 tablespoon melted butter.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nWhisk liquid ingredients into dry ingredients just until thoroughly mixed; avoid over-mixing.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nPour remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter into preheated skillet and carefully swirl to coat bottom and sides. Scrape batter into prepared skillet, smoothing the top gently with a rubber spatula. Bake until cornbread is lightly browned on top and a skewer inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nLet cool for about 15 minutes in skillet, then serve warm. (Cornbread does not keep well and will lose its texture as it cools, so it's best to eat it while it's still fresh.)\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nNotes\nA lot of industrial cornmeal is made from underripe corn and then ground using modern methods for a very consistent grind. That kind of cornmeal does not make a good Southern-style unsweetened cornbread. For best results here, use a high-quality, fresh stone-ground cornmeal, such as from\nAnson Mills\n,\nOld Mill of Guilford\n, or\nNora Mill\n; these cornmeals do not need additional sugar. If you use a more mass-market source, consider adding the optional sugar to help balance the flavor.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch cast iron skillet\nRead More\nThe Real Reason Sugar Has No Place in Cornbread\nCornbread\nSoul Food & Southern\nSides\nThanksgiving Side Dishes\nChristmas Sides"
