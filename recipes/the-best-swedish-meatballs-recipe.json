Let stand until bread is completely softened and most of the milk has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in a small skillet, melt 2 tablespoons (30g) butter over medium-high heat. Add half of minced onion and cook, stirring, until onion is golden and tender, about 7 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a food processor, combine ground beef, ground pork, soaked bread and any remaining milk, cooked onion, remaining raw onion, 4 teaspoons salt, eggs, white pepper, and allspice. Starting on low speed and increasing to medium-high, beat mixture until ingredients are thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dipping your hands in water as needed to prevent meatball mixture from sticking, roll roughly tablespoon-sized portions of meatball mixture into balls slightly smaller than golf-ball size. Transfer to lined baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSet a rack over a clean baking sheet and heat oven to 200\u00b0F (90\u00b0C). Heat about 1/2 inch oil in a wide skillet to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Working in batches, lower meatballs into oil and fry, turning until well browned all over, about 2 minutes. Transfer browned meatballs to rack and keep warm in the oven.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a medium saucepan, melt remaining 3 tablespoons (45g) butter over medium-high heat until foamy. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking, until raw flour smell is gone, about 3 minutes. Whisk in chicken stock, bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 3 minutes. Whisk in soy sauce and cider vinegar. Season with salt and white pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd meatballs to gravy and stir to coat. Simmer until meatballs are heated through. Serve right away with buttered potatoes and lingonberry jam, or speared with toothpicks as an hors d'oeuvre.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\nor\nfood processor\n, wide skillet,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\n,\nprobe\nor\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nMincing the onion will produce fine pieces for a more textured result, while grating will produce softer bits of onion that blend into the mix. Grating, however, can create bitter flavor in the onion. Once fully cooked, those bitter flavors tend to dissipate, but it is a risk worth considering.\nChristmas Appetizers\nNorthern European\nGround Beef\nPork\nBeef Mains"
