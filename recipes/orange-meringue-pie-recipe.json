Lightly prick chilled pie shell all over bottom in \u00bd-inch intervals. Line pie shell with a double layer 14-inch square of parchment paper or aluminum foil, covering edges to prevent burning. Fill with sugar, pie weights, or dried beans.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nTransfer to a parchment or foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake on lowest rack for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375\u2109 (190\u2103). Carefully remove liner and pie weights from par baked crust and bake the now uncovered crust until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside and let cool.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nFor the Orange Filling:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk egg yolks and 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces; 50g) sugar until pale yellow and light, about one minute; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nIn a medium saucepan, combine the orange juice and zest. In a separate bowl whisk the cornstarch and remaining 3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces; 148g) sugar until combined and add to the juice in saucepan. Cook the orange juice mixture over medium heat, whisk constantly, until it begins to thicken and bubble, 7 to 8 minutes. Turn off the heat. Whisking constantly, slowly pour juice mixture into yolk mixture to temper. Return tempered yolk mixture to the saucepan.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nReturn the saucepan to medium heat. Cook, whisking continuously, for an additional two minutes once bubbling, then remove from heat. Whisk in butter until fully combined and melted.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nStrain the filling through a fine-mesh strainer directly into the baked and cooled pie shell and scrape filling off the underside of the strainer into the shell. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nFor the Meringue:\nFill a medium saucepan one quarter full with water and bring to a simmer over medium heat.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nIn a stand mixer bowl, combine egg whites, 1/2 cup sugar, and cream of tartar and place over the saucepan with simmering water. Heat, whisking constantly, until sugar is dissolved and egg whites are warm to the touch (about 160\u2109 (70\u2103), 2 to 3 minutes. Test by rubbing between your fingers. Transfer bowl to stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Starting on low speed, whip egg whites, gradually increasing speed to high, until stiff and glossy peaks form, 8 to 10 minutes. Add vanilla, and mix until combined.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nFor Assembling the Pie:\nRemove the plastic from the top of the chilled filling.\u00a0Spoon the meringue evenly around the edge and then center of pie, attaching the meringue to the pie crust (to prevent shrinking while under the broiler). Using back of spoon, create attractive swirls and peaks in meringue.\nAdjust oven to broiler setting. Broil the pie on the upper-middle rack until the tips of the meringue are toasted and browned, about 2 minutes. (see notes) Let cool for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial equipment\n9-inch pie plate, medium saucepan, fine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nMake the meringue right before serving so that it doesn't form a rubbery skin on top.\nClosely monitor the pie while broiling the meringue.\nPies\nBaking\nPie Dough\nOrange",
