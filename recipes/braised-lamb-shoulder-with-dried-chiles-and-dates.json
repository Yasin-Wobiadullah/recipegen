Using kitchen shears, cut guajillo and morita chiles into strips, discarding all seeds and stems. Toast chiles in a dry skillet until fragrant. Transfer to the canister of a blender.\nIn the same dry skillet, toast cumin and coriander seeds and add to the blender canister.\nAdd tomatillos, garlic, dates, 1 tablespoon (12g) salt, and 1/2 cup (120ml) water to the canister and blend until smooth. Set chile pur\u00e9e aside.\nUsing a\nchef's knife\n, deeply score the fat cap on the lamb shoulder, cutting all the way through the fat but not into the meat below. Season lamb with remaining 1/2 tablespoon (6g) salt and place in a Dutch oven, fat side up.\nPour chile pur\u00e9e over lamb shoulder, spreading it to coat evenly. Cover Dutch oven and bake until lamb is tender and falls easily from the bone, about 5 hours. Carefully lift lamb from Dutch oven and transfer to a work surface. Skim fat off the sauce in the Dutch oven. Pull meat off bones, discard bones, then return meat to pot and mix with sauce. Serve with tortillas or over rice, with garnishes such as diced cucumbers, diced avocado, sliced radishes, and/or Cotija cheese, as desired.\nSpecial equipment\nBlender\n, Dutch oven\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThis Easy Braised Lamb Takes Spicy-Sweet Inspiration From Mexico\nLamb Shoulder\nLamb\nMexican\nDairy-free Mains\nBraised & Stewed Lamb"
