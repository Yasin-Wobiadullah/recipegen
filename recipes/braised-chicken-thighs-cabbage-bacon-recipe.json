Season chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 4- to 5-quart straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook without moving it until well-browned and crisp, about 8 minutes total, lowering heat if it starts to smoke excessively. Flip chicken and brown lightly on second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a large plate and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji-L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd bacon to pan and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain off all but 1/4 cup (60ml) rendered fat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened and starting to brown, about 4 minutes. Add cabbage and cook, stirring, until softened and starting to brown, about 4 minutes. Add mustard and vinegar and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan. Add chicken stock, sugar, bay leaves, and thyme sprigs, and bring to a simmer.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nNestle chicken back into saut\u00e9 pan, leaving the skin above the liquid but submerging most of the meat. Transfer pan to oven and cook uncovered, until chicken is totally tender and liquid has reduced by about half, about 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nRemove from oven and transfer chicken to a serving platter. Stir butter into saut\u00e9 pan and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, spooning cabbage and sauce into shallow bowls and topping with chicken.\nSpecial Equipment\nStraight-sided\nsaut\u00e9 pan\nRead More\nCrispy Braised Chicken With White Beans and Chile Verde Recipe\nEasy Skillet Braised Chicken with Peppers and Paprika Recipe\nChicken Yassa (Senegalese Braised Chicken with Caramelized Onions) Recipe\nChicken Scarpariello (Braised Chicken With Sausage and Peppers) Recipe\nChicken Mains\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Thighs\nBacon\nCabbage"
