Have large bowl of ice water ready. Place geoduck inside pot and boil briefly until skin of the trunk turns a shade darker, about 20 seconds. Using tongs, place the geoduck in ice water to stop cooking. Peel off skin by tugging it off the meat (a dry dishtowel can help to get a grip). Using a small boning knife, gently pry open shell and cut the meat away from the shell edges. Discard the sack next to the body.\nTo Serve the Trunk Sashimi-Style:\nSlice trunk thinly on a bias and dip in soy sauce and wasabi, or ponzu sauce.\nTo Saut\u00e9 the Body Meat:\nSlice thinly on a bias. Heat butter in a 10-inch stainless steel skillet over medium heat until foaming subsides and butter is slightly browned. Add geoduck slices and wine and saut\u00e9 for 5 to 10 seconds, until slices are just beginning to turn opaque. Season with salt to taste and serve immediately.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nGeoduck\nClams",
