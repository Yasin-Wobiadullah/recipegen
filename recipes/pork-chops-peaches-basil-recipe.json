Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add pork chops and cook until first side is nicely browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the internal temperature registers 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil. Do not wipe out skillet.\nLower heat to medium-low and add peaches, lemon zest, sugar, salt, and dried chile flakes. Stir gently until peaches begin to soften but retain their shape, 2 to 3 minutes.\nDivide spinach between 2 plates and put pork chops on top. Pour any juices from plate back into skillet and add butter and lemon juice. Cook, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan and swirling pan until butter is melted and incorporated into the sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in half of basil. Divide peaches between 2 plates and then pour pan juices on top and sprinkle with remaining basil. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch skillet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nWhen buying peaches for this recipe and for grilling, you want to make sure that they aren't overly ripe as they will completely fall apart during the cooking process. You don't want ones that feel like baseballs either, as they will not be sweet enough. Instead, feel for ones that give slightly when squeezed.\nPork Mains\nStovetop Pork\nPeach\nPork Chop",
