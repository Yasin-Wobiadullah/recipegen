Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.\nDecrease mixer speed to low and add flour mixture in three batches, alternating with milk mixture, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Increase speed to medium and beat mixture just until combined, about 15 seconds.\nSpoon batter over pears and spread evenly.
