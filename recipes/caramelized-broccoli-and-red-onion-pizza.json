Flour well and place each one in a separate medium mixing bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room temperature until roughly doubled in volume.\nToss broccoli, onion, pepper flakes, and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large bowl. Season with salt to taste. Set aside.\n1 hour before baking, adjust oven rack with pizza steel to top position and preheat oven to 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C). When ready to bake, turn single dough ball out onto lightly flour surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer 1-inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles into a 12 to 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.\nSpread approximately 2/3 cup of sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2 to 1-inch border along edge. Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce. Spread 1/3 of broccoli and onion mixture over surface of pizza. Switch oven to broiler, then slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until crust is golden brown and puffed, and broccoli is charred in spots, 4 to 8 minutes. Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately. Repeat with remaining 2 dough balls, remaining sauce, and remaining cheese, reheating baking steel in between pies as necessary.\nSpecial Equipment\nPizza peel\n,\nbaking steel\nor\nstone\nRead More\nOutdoor Pizza Oven Charred Broccoli Rabe and Anchovy Pizza\nGrilled Pizza With Grilled Broccolini, Chiles, and Garlic\n11 Essential Tips for Better Pizza\nItalian-American\nVegetarian Mains\nBread\nBroccoli\nOnions"
