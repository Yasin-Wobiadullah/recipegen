Stir in the chopped kimchi, scallion segments, shrimp, and salt. Add a little more water if needed. Set batter aside.\nIn a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar or honey, and sesame seeds. Set dipping sauce aside.\nPreheat oven to its lowest heat setting. In a large skillet, heat about 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet and spread it into a 4-inch circle. Repeat until pan is full but not crowded. (Alternatively, you can make one large 8-inch pancake per batch). Cook until the edges turn golden and crispy, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancakes, add a little more oil, if needed, and cook for about another 2 to 3 minutes until cooked through. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding oil as needed.\nArrange cooked pancakes in a single layer on a baking sheet and keep in warm oven until ready to serve. Serve whole or cut into wedges, garnished with scallions, and with dipping sauce and quick-pickled radishes on the side.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMake Killer Shrimp Pancakes With the Brine in Your Kimchi Jar\nHors D'Oeuvres\nKorean\nStovetop\nShrimp"
