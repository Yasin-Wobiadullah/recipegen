Increase heat to high and cook, stirring just enough to prevent scorching on bottom of pot, until berries are foamy, about 10 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring more frequently and lowering temperature as foam begins to subside, 10 to 20 minutes longer. Cook until most of the fruit is disintegrated and bubbles have slowed down and become glossy, about 10 more minutes (times can vary depending on fruit).\nTest for doneness: Turn off heat and set a small spoonful of jam in the freezer for 5 minutes. Jam is done once it holds together and doesn't run off the spoon when tilted; if jam is too runny, return to low heat and continue to cook, stirring frequently and repeating doneness test every 5 minutes, until jam passes test.
