Grease an 18- by 24-inch sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray (you can also use two, slightly overlapping 12- by 24-inch sheets of aluminum foil); set aside.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nIn a 12-inch cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onion, bell pepper, and carrots, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nIn a large bowl, combine pork, cheese, breadcrumbs, eggs, oyster sauce, fish sauce, black pepper, soy sauce, salt, cayenne, and cooled vegetable mixture. Using your hands or a sturdy silicone spatula, mix until thoroughly combined, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nOn a work surface, position prepared aluminum foil with one longer side lying parallel to the edge of the surface. Transfer meat mixture to center of foil and, using your hands, shape into an 8- by 15-inch rectangle. In the center of the rectangle, place eggs horizontally in a single line. Position sausage links horizontally in a single line directly above eggs, making sure that the eggs and sausage are touching one another.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nWorking with the longer side closest to you, lift the edge of the aluminum foil and gently begin to roll the meat (which will release from the foil), folding the meat over the eggs and sausage and enclosing them in the middle of the embutido. Continue rolling, using foil to lift and roll embutido, to form a tight log. Wrap aluminum foil tightly around embutido, then fold in the ends. Wrap embutido with another sheet of aluminum foil, folding in ends.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nTransfer embutido to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until juices leak outside of foil and caramelize on baking sheet, and internal temperature registers 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nTransfer embutido to a cutting board and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes. Using a sharp knife, cut into 1 1/2-inch-thick slices and carefully remove aluminum foil.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nTransfer sliced embutido to a large serving platter. Serve immediately with white rice and sweet and sour sauce alongside.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n.\nNotes\nCane vinegar can be found in Filipino and Asian markets, as well as online.\nBanana ketchup can be found at Filipino and Asian markets, as well as online. If you can\u2019t find banana ketchup, you can substitute with tomato ketchup.\nChinese sausage can be found in Asian markets and online.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe sweet and sour sauce can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nEmbutido can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month. To freeze a whole embutido, follow recipe through step 7 and allow to cool to room temperature before freezing (keep it wrapped in aluminum foil); thaw before reheating. To reheat, slice embutido, remove aluminum foil, and gently heat in the microwave before serving.\nFilipino\nRoasted Pork\nPork\nPork Mains\nThe Latest",
