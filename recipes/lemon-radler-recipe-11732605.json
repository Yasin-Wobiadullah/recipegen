Halve and juice; pour juice into a sealable container and refrigerate. Cut rinds into 1-inch chunks. Toss with sugar in a large nonreactive mixing bowl, cover tightly with plastic, and let stand at room temperature, stirring once every 45 minutes or so, until sugar has completely dissolved, about 3 hours. (You can let the mixture stand up to 12 hours, if desired.)\nAdd 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) of reserved lemon juice. Stir well, then strain through a nonreactive fine-mesh strainer or piece of cheesecloth into a glass or ceramic container. At this point, the concentrated lemon syrup can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.\nWhen ready to serve, add sparkling water to concentrated lemon syrup. Adjust to taste with additional sparkling water or lemon juice; bear in mind that a tart lemonade tastes best when mixed with beer.\nFor Each Radler:\nAdd beer and Sparkling Lemonade to a 16-ounce pint glass. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nCheesecloth or nonreactive fine-mesh strainer, 2-quart pitcher\nNotes\nCrisp pilsner makes for an especially refreshing radler, but you can also use your favorite hefeweizen or even a bitter IPA.\nDrinks\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nLemon\nSummer Drinks"
