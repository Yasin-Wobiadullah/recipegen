Increase speed to medium-high and beat whites until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add the sugar and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes.\nAdd egg yolks and beat just until combined. Decrease speed to low and add flour mixture in three batches, alternating with milk. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with rubber spatula as necessary. Add vanilla and beat just until combined. Fold in coconut with rubber spatula.\nScrape batter into ungreased 13- by 9-inch baking dish and smooth out top. Bake until cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes, rotating cake halfway through baking. Transfer cake to cooling rack and cool in pan completely, 1 to 2 hours. Once cooled, poke cake all over with fork or skewer and run a paring knife along the edges just to separate the cake from the sides of the baking dish.\nFor the Coconut Milk Bath:\nWhisk coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and cream together in large bowl. Pour mixture evenly all over cake (See notes). Transfer to refrigerator and chill at least 2 hours.\nFor the Toasted Meringue Topping:\nStir sugar, water, and corn syrup in heavy-bottomed medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and boil syrup until it registers 240\u00b0F on candy thermometer, 8 to 10 minutes.\nWhile syrup boils, in large bowl, beat egg whites and salt with whisk attachment on medium-low speed until whites begin to loosen and froth, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and beat whites until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes.\nWith mixer running on medium-high speed, slowly and carefully add syrup to egg whites. Beat until outside of bowl is cool to the touch and whites are thick and glossy, about 7 minutes. Fold in toasted coconut.\nSpread topping on cooled cake with a spatula, pulling up on meringue to create decorative peaks. Torch meringue to lightly toast. If you don\u2019t have a torch, adjust oven rack to upper third and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Bake until golden, about 5 minutes.\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric mixer, rubber spatula, 13- by 9-inch baking dish, medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, candy thermometer, torch (optional, See Recipe Step 10)\nCakes\nCentral American\nMexican\nBaking\nCoconut"
