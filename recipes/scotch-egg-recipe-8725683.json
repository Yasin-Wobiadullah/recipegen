Carefully lower 4 eggs into pot and cook for six and a half minutes. Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer eggs to ice bath and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under cool running water; set eggs aside.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nIn a medium bowl, combine 1/2 cup (30g) panko breadcrumbs, parsley, chives, thyme, nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Add ground pork and, using a clean hand, gently mix, teasing apart ground meat with your fingers, just until mixture comes together and no unincorporated breadcrumbs and herbs remain. Avoid mixing any more than necessary.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nForm pork mixture into 4 portions (about 3 1/2 ounces or 100g each); set aside on a large plate or 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nSet 3 wide, shallow bowls on a work surface. Add 3/4 cup flour to (100g) the first bowl, 3 eggs to the second bowl; and 2 cups (100g) panko breadcrumbs to the third bowl. Using a fork, whisk eggs.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nCover your kitchen counter with a 9- by 13-inch piece of plastic wrap. Place 1 portion of the ground pork mixture on top of the plastic wrap and, using wet hands, flatten meat into a 5-mm thick, 5-inch wide patty.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nIn a large saucepan, heat 2 quarts of oil over high heat until the oil registers 338\u00baF (170\u00baC) on an instant-read thermometer.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nMeanwhile: Dredge 1 boiled egg in flour, shaking off excess. Place egg in center of the sausage patty. Using the plastic wrap, lift sides of patty to wrap it around the egg until egg is completely encased in ground pork, using your fingers to gently shape the meat evenly around the egg and seal. Dredge wrapped egg in flour, shaking of excess. Transfer scotch egg to egg dish, and, using your right hand, turn to evenly coat. Lift and allow excess egg to drain, then transfer to bread crumb mixture. With your left hand, scoops breadcrumbs over scotch egg, then gently press, turning to ensure a good layer of crumbs on both sides. Return egg to large plate or 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet and repeat with remaining eggs.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nWorking in batches, carefully use a slotted spoon to gently lower 2 eggs into the pan. Temperature will drop; adjust flame to maintain oil temperature as needed. Cook until golden brown, crisp, pork is fully cooked and no longer pink, and registers 160\u00baF (71\u00baC) on an instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and season with salt right away. Repeat with remaining eggs.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nUsing a serrated knife, halve eggs. (The yolk should be jammy and slightly more set than a soft-boiled egg.) Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot, spider skimmer or slotted spoon, large plate or 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet, plastic wrap, instant-read thermometer\nNotes\nScotch eggs can be served cold or at room temperature. The pork will be firmer when cold, making it easier to pick up and eat as a snack. However, the breadcrumbs will be softer.\nThe recipe can be doubled if desired.\nIf you don\u2019t own a kitchen scale, do your best to divide the meat into equal portions.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nEggs can be boiled, peeled, and refrigerated in an airtight container 1 day in advance.\nScotch eggs can be prepared up to step 8 and refrigerated in a paper towel-lined airtight container for up to 2 days. When ready to fry, proceed with step 8.\nIf eaten cold or room temperature, scotch eggs can be fried up to 2 days beforehand and stored in a paper towel-lined sealed container in the fridge. Eat them straight out of the fridge, or leave them at room temperature for 30 minutes before eating.\nTo reheat fully cooked scotch eggs, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Bake eggs until warmed through or they have an internal temperature of 145\u00baF (63\u00baC), about 10 minutes.\nBoiled Eggs\nThe Latest\nSnacks & Appetizers\nPork\nBritish",
