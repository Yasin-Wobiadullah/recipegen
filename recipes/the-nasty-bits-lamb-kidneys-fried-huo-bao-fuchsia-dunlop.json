  "full_text": "The Nasty Bits: Lamb Kidneys Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nTotal\n20 mins\nServes\n2 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\npound\nlamb kidneys\n, about\n2 or 3\nkidneys\n1\ntablespoon\nrice wine\n1/2\nteaspoon\ncornstarch\n1/2\nteaspoon\nchile pepper\u00a0or\nchile pepper flakes\n1/2\nteaspoon\ncurry powder\n1/4\nteaspoon\nturmeric\n1/2\ncup\noil\n, for\npassing through\nDirections\nRemove the kidneys from the fat. Using a paring knife, cut away the rest of the fat and gristle in the middle of the kidneys, taking care to keep the organs as whole as possible. Slice off thin, 1/4 inch-thick slices of the kidneys that are approximately 3/4 to 1 inch in length.\nWith your knife slanted at a 45\u00b0 angle, lightly score the surface of the kidneys in one direction, then in the other direction perpendicular to the first cuts. You should have a crosshatch pattern when finished.\nMix the slices of kidney with the rest of the ingredients for the marinade.\nIn a wok, heat the oil to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for deep frying. Add a few slices of kidney at a time so as not to cool down the oil. Deep-fry for 40 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes, depending on the size of your slices. Serve immediately while the slices are hot and crispy.\nLamb\nDairy-free Mains\nStir-Fry\nLamb Mains",
