Transfer to refrigerator and allow the mixture to rest for about ten minutes.\nHeat oil in a large heavy-bottomed non-stick skillet over high heat until shimmering. Lower heat to medium-low. With a tablespoon scoop out prawn mixture into hands and shape into rounds (wet your hands with some water so the mix doesn't stick). Lower gently into the hot oil, standing a little away from the pan. Fry until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes total, flipping occasionally. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat until all patties are cooked. Serve immediately with coriander chutney, kachumbar (salad), or with spicy tomato sauce as a starter or with a main meal as a side.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor (optional)\nSnacks & Appetizers\nIndian\nFrying\nShrimp\nPotatoes"
