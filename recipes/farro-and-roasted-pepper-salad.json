Add farro, reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and cook according to the directions on the packaging, anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. When done, drain in a colander or sieve, rinse under cold water, and set aside to drain.\nMeanwhile, using a small pairing knife, cut around the stem of each pepper, removing the stem along with all the seeds. Set a grill pan over high heat. Place peppers on the grill pan and cook, flipping occasionally, until totally black on all sides, 20 to 30 minutes. When done, transfer to a bag and set aside for a few minutes to steam. Once cool, remove the blackened skin, and cut the flesh into 3/8-inch-wide slices.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine cooked farro, red pepper slices, olives, thyme, scallions, most of the feta, and dressing. Toss gently, and season to taste with salt. Serve with remaining feta and a sprinkle of paprika.\nGrain Salads",
