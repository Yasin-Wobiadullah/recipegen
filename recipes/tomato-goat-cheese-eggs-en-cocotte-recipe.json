In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and rosemary and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 4 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Discard rosemary sprig.\nGrease 4 (4-ounce) ramekins with olive oil. Lightly sprinkle salt on the bottom and side of each ramekin. Scoop enough tomato mixture to form a thin, even layer on the bottom of each ramekin. Form a circular depression in the center of the tomato mixture in each ramekin. (This will help cradle the egg yolk and keep it centered.)\nGently slide an egg into each ramekin. Arrange crumbled goat cheese around each egg, then season with salt and pepper. Place ramekins in a baking dish and transfer to oven. Carefully pour enough boiling water into baking dish to submerge ramekins 3/4 of the way. Bake eggs en cocotte until whites are just set and yolks are still jiggly, about 15 minutes. Very carefully remove baking dish from oven.\nUsing a very thin metal spatula and tongs, lift each ramekin out of the hot water. Set ramekins on a clean kitchen towel to dry bottoms, then transfer to plates. Drizzle with fresh olive oil and serve right away with toasts.\nSpecial equipment\n4 (4-ounce) ramekins, baking dish\nThis Recipe Appears In\nEggs en Cocotte: An Easy (But Often Forgotten) Egg Breakfast\nBaked Eggs\nSavory\nGoat Cheese\nTomato\nBreakfast & Brunch",
