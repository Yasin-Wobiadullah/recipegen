Add reserved beans, meat, vegetables back to pot, stirring to combine. Stir in 1 to 2 cups of stock or water to reach desired consistency. Return to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, then cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and ham is heated through, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nDivide soup among warmed bowls, sprinkle with parsley and pepper, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nSpecial Equipment\n4-quart saucier\n,\nlarge Dutch oven\n,\nimmersion blender\nor\ncountertop blender\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.\u00a0 The soup will thicken after being refrigerated.
