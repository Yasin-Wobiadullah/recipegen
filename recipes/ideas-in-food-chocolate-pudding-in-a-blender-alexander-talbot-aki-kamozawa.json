Bring the mixture to a boil, then remove it from the heat. Turn the blender containing the egg and tapioca mixture back on low. Quickly and carefully, pour the hot milk mixture into the blender and increase the speed to medium. The heat will cook the egg yolks and allow the tapioca to thicken to the consistency of thick mayonnaise.\nWith the blender running, add the chocolate in stages so it is emulsified\ninto the pudding. When all the chocolate is added, strain the\npudding into a serving bowl (or six individual bowls), and let it cool\nto room temperature before transferring to the refrigerator to cool\ncompletely.\nSpecial equipment\nblender\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nChocolate"
