Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water, and using a colander, drain spaghetti.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nWhile pasta is cooking, make the sauce:\nIn a large cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add sausages and cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly brown on all sides, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nAdd onion and garlic, and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring constantly, until onion and garlic are tender and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add bell peppers, mushrooms, ketchup, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Cook, stirring frequently, until ketchup thickens and darkens slightly, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nAdd reserved pasta water, butter, and black pepper. Using tongs, transfer spaghetti directly into simmering sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, until pasta is al dente and sauce has thickened so it coats noodles and isn't watery, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Divide among two to three bowls or plates, and top each portion with a fried egg (if using), cheese, parsley (if using), and hot sauce to taste.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nNote\nIf you can\u2019t get mini Japanese smoked sausages, American-style mini smoked sausages, such as Lit'l Smokies. You can also use two regular hot dogs or extra-thick-cut bacon.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nJapanese\nPastas\nEast Asian",
