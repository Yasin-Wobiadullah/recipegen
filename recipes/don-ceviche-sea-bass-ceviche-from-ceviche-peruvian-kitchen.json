Stir and then leave to infuse for 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a sieve into another bowl. Add salt and amarillo chili paste and mix well. This will keep for 4 hours in the fridge.\nTo make the ceviche:\nRinse the onion and then leave it to soak in iced water for 10 minutes. Drain thoroughly, spread out on a paper towel or a clean kitchen towel to remove any excess water and then place in the fridge until needed. This will reduce the strength of the onion and help to keep the slices crisp.\nCut the fish into uniform strips of around 1 1/4 by 3/4 inch (3 by 2 cm). Place in a large bowl, add a good pinch of salt, and mix together gently with a metal spoon. The salt will help open the fish\u2019s pores. Leave this for 2 minutes and then pour over the tiger\u2019s milk and combine gently with the spoon. Leave the fish to \u201ccook\u201d in this marinade for 2 minutes.\nAdd the onion, cilantro, chili, and sweet potato to the fish. Mix together gently with the spoon and taste to check that the balance of salt, sour, and chili is to your liking. Divide among serving bowls and serve immediately.\nHors D'Oeuvres\nPeruvian\nFish"
