In the bowl of a food processor, grind hazelnuts to form a smooth and creamy paste. Combine hazelnut paste, butter, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With mixer running, add egg and continue beating only until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour all at once, and mix to form a stiff dough. If not tempering the chocolate, fold chopped pieces into the dough now.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPortion the Dough:\nDivide in 2-tablespoon portions and round each one into a smooth ball. (Portioned dough can be refrigerated in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70\u00b0F or 21\u00b0C, and proceed as directed.)\nTo Bake:\nArrange portions on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving 2 inches between cookies to account for spread. Bake until puffed and pale gold around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 12 minutes. Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Finish the Cookies:\nWhen the cookies have cooled to room temperature, drizzle with tempered milk chocolate. Once the chocolate has set, transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax or parchment paper between each layer and store up to a week at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, stand mixer, half sheet\nNotes\nThis recipe can also be made with an equal weight of toasted almonds and a teaspoon of almond extract added along with the vanilla.\nCookies\nBaking\nChocolate\nHazelnuts",
