Transfer about 1/3 of marinade to a small saucepan.\nSerious Eats/ Melati Citrawireja\nAdd chicken pieces to large bowl with marinade and toss to evenly coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours.\nSerious Eats/ Melati Citrawireja\nMeanwhile, cook reserved marinade in saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it reduces by half, becomes thick and glossy, and coats the back of a spoon, about 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside.\nSerious Eats/ Melati Citrawireja\nThread the chicken pieces onto skewers, packing them tightly as you go.\nSerious Eats/ Melati Citrawireja\nFor a Charcoal Grill:\nOpen bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled 3/4 with charcoal briquettes (4 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over bottom of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\nFor a Gas Grill:\nTurn all burners to high, cover grill and heat until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.\nClean and oil cooking grate. Arrange skewers on the grill and cook, turning as needed for even browning, until chicken is nicely charred, cooked through, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of each chicken piece registers at least 175\u00b0F (76\u00b0C), 8 to 12 minutes for thighs and 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), 6 to 10 minutes for breasts. Transfer to a serving platter. Using a pastry brush, brush hot chicken with reduced glaze and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats/ Melati Citrawireja\nSerious Eats/ Melati Citrawireja\nSpecial Equipment\nSmall saucepan, 4 to 6 (10- to 12-inch long) wooden or metal cooking skewers, charcoal or gas grill, grilling tongs, chimney starter if using charcoal grill, pastry brush\nNotes\nFor best results, look for a mild-to-medium-spicy harissa to balance heat without overpowering the other flavors. I recommend mild harissa and prefer the brand Mina.\nI prefer using chicken thighs in this recipe, but boneless, skinless chicken breasts will also work.\nIf using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes before threading the chicken on and grill immediately after threading.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe marinade can be prepared and refrigerated in an airtight container up to 7 days ahead.\nThe glaze can be cooked and then refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 7 days ahead; gently reheat before brushing on the cooked chicken.\nThe chicken can be marinated for up to 8 hours.\nLeftover cooked skewers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\nGrilled Chicken\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nChicken Mains\nGrilling"
