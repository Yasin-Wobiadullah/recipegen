Blend until a rough pur\u00e9e is formed, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats/Melissa Hom\nDivide chicken and marinade between two gallon-sized zipper-lock bags, or place in a large baking dish and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place whole allspice berries and bay leaves in a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and fill with water. Refrigerate chicken and bay leaves at least 10 hours and up to 1 day.\nSerious Eats/Melissa Hom\nWhen ready to cook, remove chicken from bags, allow excess marinade to drip off, and transfer to a large plate.\nLight one half chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and pile the coals against one wall of a kettle grill. Alternatively, set the leftmost burners of a gas grill to medium-high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil\nthe grilling grate. Set bottom and lid vents to half-open.\nSerious Eats/Melissa Hom\nDrain bay leaves and allspice berries in a fine-mesh strainer. Spread 2/3 of bay leaves evenly over the cooler side of the grill (it's ok if some allspice berries fall through) in a pattern just large enough to fit the chickens. Lay the chickens over the bay leaves skin side up with the legs pointed towards the hotter side of the grill. Place 1/3 of remaining bay leaves over hot side of grill and immediately cover, with the vent above the chicken. Cook for 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats/Melissa Hom\nOpen lid and place half of remaining bay leaves and allspice berries on hot side of grill directly above the coals. Immediately cover and cook for another 15 minutes. Open lid, add 15 new coals to the pile of hot coals, then place remaining bay leaves and allspice berries on hot side of grill directly above the coals. Cover and continue to cook until the coolest part of the chicken breast registers 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats/Melissa Hom\nUncover grill and wait 5 minutes until coals are hot again (if using gas grill, increase heat to high). Carefully lift the chicken off the bay leaves and transfer it to the hot side of the grill skin side up. Using tongs, drop the bay leaves into the grill directly onto the coals or burners so that they smoke. Cook the chicken until lightly charred, about 3 minutes. Flip chicken and continue to cook until skin is crisp and charred and coolest part of breast registers 150\u00b0F to 155\u00b0F (66\u00b0C to 68\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 4 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer to a large platter, allow to rest 5 minutes, and serve.\nSerious Eats/Melissa Hom\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nfood processor\nor\nblender\nNotes\nScotch bonnet peppers are extremely hot. Handle with caution and consider wearing latex gloves. Wash knife, cutting board, and all surfaces immediately after working with them. Do not touch your face or any sensitive areas until you've thoroughly scrubbed your hands. If they are unavailable, substitute habanero peppers. You can use a mix of ripe and unripe chiles to add flavor.\nTo split a chicken, start by using sharp poultry shears to remove the backbone by cutting along both edges of the spine. Next, flip the bird over and flatten it slightly by pressing down. Cut the bird in half along the center of the breastbone with a sharp knife. Your butcher should be able to do this for you. You can also substitute four chicken leg quarters if you prefer more dark meat (I do).\nThis recipe can easily be doubled. To double, use twice the amount of chicken but the same amount of marinade. Cook all four chicken halves on the grill at the same time.\nGrilled Chicken\nJamaican\nWhole Chicken\nChicken Mains\nMemorial Day"
