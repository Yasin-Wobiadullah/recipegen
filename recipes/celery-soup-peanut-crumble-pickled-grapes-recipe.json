Remove from heat and let cool. Place grapes in a nonreactive heatproof bowl and pour pickling liquid on top. Lay a paper towel directly against surface to submerge grapes. Let grapes marinate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and preferably overnight.\nSerious Eats / Emily Dryden\nMeanwhile, for the Peanut Crumble:\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). In a medium mixing bowl, combine peanut butter, butter, flour, confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, salt, dill, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Using your hands, rub together until mixture is thoroughly combined and forms small clumps.\nSpread crumble mixture evenly on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment or foil. Bake, tossing once during baking, until crumble is evenly golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.\nSerious Eats / Emily Dryden\nMeanwhile, for the Celery Soup:\nIn a Dutch oven or large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat until foamy. Add onion, celery, celery root, apple, and a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.\nAdd vegetable stock or water and simmer until vegetables are completely tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in reserved celery leaves.\nSerious Eats / Emily Dryden\nWorking in batches, ladle vegetables and broth into a blender pitcher, making sure not to fill pitcher more than halfway. Blend soup, starting at low speed and gradually increasing speed to high, until totally smooth. If needed, strain soup through a fine-mesh strainer before returning to pot.\nTo Serve:\nBring soup back to a simmer and add cream. Season with salt and a few tablespoons of the grape-pickling liquid. Serve hot, garnishing with peanut crumble and pickled grapes.\nSerious Eats / Emily Dryden\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nDutch oven\nor large\nsaucepan\n,\nblender\n(preferably\nhigh-powered\n),\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nTo peel grapes, use a sharp\nparing knife\nto carefully strip away the skin. Feel free to save time by simply cutting skin-on grapes in half.\nRead More\nCreamy Spiced Parsnip Soup\nThe Best Potato-Leek Soup\nHot or Cold Creamy Lettuce Soup\nVegetarian Mains\nGrape\nPeanuts\nCelery Root\nCelery",
