  "full_text": "Fresh Pineapple Ice Cream\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n25 mins\nChurning/Freezing Time\n8 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n8 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n6\nounces\nplain or\nvery lightly toasted\nsugar\n(about 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons; 170g)\n3/4\nounce\ncornstarch\n(about 3 tablespoons; 20g)\n1/4\nteaspoon\n(1g) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight\n2\nlarge\neggs\n(about 3 1/2 ounces; 100g)\n10\nounces\nfresh pineapple pur\u00e9e\n(about 1 1/4 cups; 285g), from about 1 small pineapple (see note)\n2\nounces\nfresh lemon juice\n(about 1/4 cup; 55g)\n8\nounces\nheavy cream\n(about 1 cup; 225g), straight from the fridge\n1/2 to 1\nounce\nlight rum\nor rhum agricole (about 1 to 2 tablespoons; 15 to 30g), optional\n2 or 3\ndrops\nvanilla extract\nDirections\nIn a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, salt, and eggs, followed by pineapple pur\u00e9e and lemon juice. (If you like, save the pineapple core and lemon rind to make a\nno-cook pineapple syrup\n.) Cook over medium-low heat, whisking gently but constantly, until warm, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium and continue whisking until thick and steaming-hot, about 2 minutes longer. When the custard begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for exactly 30 seconds to neutralize a starch-dissolving enzyme found in egg yolks.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStrain through a nonreactive sieve into a nonreactive container, then whisk in cream, rum (if using), and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate or place in an ice bath until no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen the ice cream looks thick and light, shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape ice cream into the chilled container. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until firm enough to scoop, about 4 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion blender\n;\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n;\nnonreactive fine-mesh strainer\n;\nstainless steel mixing bowl\n;\nice cream maker\n;\nflexible spatula\n; nonreactive, freezer-safe container\nNotes\nTo pur\u00e9e a pineapple, trim off the ends, skin, and eyes, cut out the core, and crosscut it into slices, then process with a blender until smoothly pur\u00e9ed. The pineapple can be pur\u00e9ed just before use, or up to 3 days in advance. In the latter case, refrigerate the pineapple pur\u00e9e with the lemon juice in a nonreactive, airtight container until ready to use. If you like, save the leftover pineapple core and lemon rind to make a\nfresh, no-cook pineapple syrup\n.\nRead More\nSpicy Pineapple and Tequila Sorbet\nVirgin Pi\u00f1a Colada Popsicles Recipe\nBoozy Pi\u00f1a Colada Popsicles Recipe\nGrilled Pineapple With Coconut-Condensed Milk-Butter Sauce\nFrozen Jungle Bird Cocktail\nIce Cream\nPineapple\n4th of July\nSummer Desserts",
