  "full_text": "Gluten-Free Flour Tortillas Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n60 mins\nActive\nAbout 40 mins\nTotal\n75 mins\nMakes\n12 tortillas\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2\ncups\n(about\n6\nounces\n)\nwhite rice flour\n, plus additional for kneading and rolling tortillas (see note)\n1/2\ncup\n(about\n2\nounces\n)\ntapioca starch\n2\nteaspoons\ngranulated sugar\n1\nteaspoon\nxanthan gum\n1/2\nteaspoon\nbaking powder\n1/2\nteaspoon\nsalt\n2\ntablespoons\nlard\nor vegetable shortening\n3/4\ncup\ncold\nwater\n, plus more as needed\nDirections\nWhisk together white rice flour, tapioca starch, granulated sugar, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Using your hands, cut shortening into flour with a motion that's similar to snapping. No large pieces of shortening should remain.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nAdd 1/2 cup water. Stir into dough using a wooden spoon. Dough will be dry. Add additional 1/4 cup water. Stir. If dough begins to hold together, stop. If dough remains dry, add water, 2 tablespoons at a time, until it beings to hold together but isn't wet. It's a good idea to feel the dough as you add the water. It should feel damp, not wet.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nTurn dough onto generously white rice floured countertop. Begin to knead dough until it's smooth. It should not stick to your hands nor should it be wet. If the dough seems dry, add a tablespoon of water. If the dough is too wet, knead in additional flour. To test the consistency, pinch off a generous tablespoon and roll it between your palms. The dough should form a ball easily and not stick to your hands. Cover dough with plastic wrap.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nHeat 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Line a tortilla press with a plastic bag that you've cut open on two sides. Flour the plastic bag with white rice flour. Pinch off about two tablespoons of dough. Roll into a ball and place in tortilla press. Flatten dough in the press. Remove. If dough seems thick, peel back the plastic bag from the tortilla, dust with a little additional white rice flour, cover and roll out slightly.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nIncrease skillet heat to high. Heat until skillet begins to smoke lightly. Remove tortilla from plastic bag. Place in hot skillet. Cook for about 3 minutes. Tortilla should be lightly brown. (As your first tortilla cooks, begin pressing out the next tortilla.) Flip and cook for an additional 1 or 2 minutes. Immediately transfer hot tortilla to a plate. Cover with a towel. Repeat process until all dough is used.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nTortillas are best served right away. However, they can be stored overnight in a sealed plastic bag. Heat before serving to soften.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch\ncast iron skillet\nor\ngriddle\n;\ntortilla press\n;\nrolling pin\n(optional)\nNotes\nFor whole-grain tortillas, replace the white rice flour with a gluten-free whole-grain flour, such as brown rice flour, sorghum flour, or a combination.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nCooled tortillas can be stored overnight in a sealed plastic bag.\nRead More\nMexican-Style Flour Tortillas Recipe\nEasy Nixtamalized Corn Tortillas Recipe\n3 Gluten-Free Flour Blends You Can Use in Any Recipe\nStovetop\nGluten-free Sides\nQuick Sides",
