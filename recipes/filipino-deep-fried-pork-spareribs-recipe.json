Pour in marinade, seal tightly, and toss to distribute marinade evenly. Place in refrigerator and marinate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight, turning bag at least once during that time.\nFill a wok or Dutch oven at least 4 inches deep with oil and heat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) over high heat. Working in batches, transfer 1/3 of ribs to a medium bowl (they should be wet and dripping with marinade), add 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and toss until ribs are evenly coated in a sticky, paste-like batter.\nCarefully lower ribs, one at a time, into hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally for even cooking. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season lightly with salt. Repeat with remaining ribs. Serve immediately with vinegar for dipping.\nNotes\nHave your butcher slice the ribs across the bone (it's a task most easily done with a bandsaw).\nFilipino\nFrying\nPork\nPork Mains"
