Cut in half and finely shred.\nSerious Eats / Marisa McClellan\nPlace cut cabbage in large bowl and sprinkle salt on top.\nUsing your hands, knead the salt into the cabbage, squeezing firmly to help release liquid from the cabbage. You can also use a potato masher to pound the cabbage until it begins to break down.\nSerious Eats / Marisa McClellan\nWhen the volume of cabbage appears to have reduced by half, add the caraways seeds and work them in.\nSerious Eats / Marisa McClellan\nPack the salted cabbage into the quart jar in layers, firmly pressing it down each time before adding more (the entire 2 pounds of cabbage should fit into a quart jar).\nSerious Eats / Marisa McClellan\nPress cabbage down firmly in the jar, so that liquid bubbles up over the surface of the jar.\nLoosely cap the jar and place it in a cool, dark spot.\nCheck every other day, removing any bloom and pressing cabbage down if it has floated above the liquid (be warned, it will be a bit stinky. That\u2019s normal).\nAfter two weeks, taste the sauerkraut. If you like the flavor, place the jar in the refrigerator. If you want something a bit stronger, let it continue to ferment until it pleases you.\nSpecial Equipment\nSharp knife\n, quart-sized canning jar\nRead More\nHomemade Sauerkraut Recipe\nLacto-Fermented Dill Pickles Recipe\nThe Science of Lactic Acid Fermentation\nThe Essential Tools You Need for Fermentation at Home\nCondiments & Sauces\nFermentation\nCabbage\nMemorial Day",
