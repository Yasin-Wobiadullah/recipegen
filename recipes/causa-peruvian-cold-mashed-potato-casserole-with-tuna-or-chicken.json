Let cool just slightly, then scoop out the flesh and, using a ricer or food mill, mash the potatoes into a large heatproof mixing bowl.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, if using frozen aji amarillo peppers, in a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add frozen peppers, remove from heat, and let steep 5 minutes. Stem and seed peppers (wear gloves if possible, as peppers are spicy), then blend the flesh without any additional liquid until a smooth and even paste forms. (Extra aji amarillo paste can be stored in the refrigerator with a layer of oil poured on top for up to 2 weeks.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd 3 tablespoons (45ml) homemade or store-bought aji amarillo paste to potatoes, along with the oil, and 4 tablespoons (60ml) lime juice. Season with salt. Fold together until evenly incorporated, then taste. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) lime juice, if desired. Press plastic directly against the surface of the mashed potatoes and refrigerate until chilled.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a medium mixing bowl, stir together tuna (or chicken), onion, and mayonnaise until evenly mixed. Season with salt. Keep chilled.\nWhen ready to assemble, lay down an even roughly 1-inch layer of mashed potatoes in the bottom of a 2-quart casserole dish; alternatively, you can build the causa on individual serving plates using a ring mold to help form it into a neat cylinder.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNext add a roughly 1-inch thick layer of the tuna or chicken salad. If adding other ingredients like diced, poached shrimp or diced avocado, layer them in either above or below the tuna or chicken salad.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTop with a final layer of the mashed potatoes. You can garnish the top of your causa with whatever you want, including pieces of black olive, sliced or diced tomato, fresh minced herbs, sliced or diced avocado, pieces of shrimp, et cetera.\nKeep chilled until ready to serve. The causa in the casserole can be refrigerated overnight.\nSpecial Equipment\nRicer\nor\nfood mill\n, 2-quart\ncasserole dish\nor ring molds\nNotes\nYou can find frozen aji amarillo peppers (in 15 oz bags) in the freezer section of a well-stocked Latin American grocer; 10.5 oz jars of aji amarillo paste are also found at Latin American grocers and\nonline\nas well.\nSides\nPeruvian\nChicken\nTuna\nPotatoes",
