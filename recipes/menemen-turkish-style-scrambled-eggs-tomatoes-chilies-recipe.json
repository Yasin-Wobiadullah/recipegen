Add paprika, oregano, onion, and peppers. Season with salt and a very generous amount of black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until very soft, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until deepened in color. Remove half of mixture and reserve.\nReturn pan to heat and add beaten eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until eggs are just barely set. Immediately remove from heat and gently fold in reserved vegetable mixture. Sprinkle with chives, if using, and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nMedium\nnonstick\nor\ncast iron skillet\nNotes\nIf you have access to Aleppo or Urfa chilies, you can use them in place of the paprika for a more authentic flavor. Chives are not traditional in this dish, but I often like to add them because eggs and chives were made for each other; you can opt to include or omit them.\nTurkish\nDairy-free Breakfast & Brunch\nDairy-free Mains\nStovetop Eggs\nScrambled Eggs",
