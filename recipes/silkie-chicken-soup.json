Remove from heat. Drain, then transfer chicken to a large bowl of cold water until cool. Drain well. Rub chicken all over with Shaoxing wine and 1 tablespoons salt.\nMeanwhile, in a medium heatproof bowl, combine jujubes, shiitakes, goji berries, Chinese yam (if using), angelica root, and lily bulb. Pour 1 2/3 cup (400ml) boiling water all over and let stand until rehydrated, about 15 minutes. If using whole shiitakes, cut into slices after rehydrating.\nClean stockpot or Dutch oven and return silkie chicken to it along with any Shaoxing wine. Add rehydrated aromatics and their soaking liquid along with scallions, ginger, dried scallops, and white pepper. Cover with 4 quarts (4L) cold water and set over medium heat until gently simmering; skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer and cook until chicken is cooked through and meat can be pulled from bones easily, about 45 minutes.\nCarefully remove chicken from pot and transfer to a work surface until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Using your hands, shred meat and skin from chicken and place in a small bowl; refrigerate until ready to use. Return carcass to broth, cover, and cook at a very gentle simmer for a clearer broth, about 3 hours, or a light boil for a creamier broth, about 2 hours. Strain broth, discarding chicken carcass and aromatics.\nReturn stock to cleaned pot and season with salt and/or white soy sauce.\nFor Garnish:\nIn a small heatproof bowl, combine jujubes and goji berries and add enough boiling water to just cover. Let stand until rehydrated, about 2 minutes.\nWhen ready to serve, add shredded chicken meat to broth and reheat until simmering. Divide jujube, goji berry, and scallion garnishes among serving bowls and ladle broth and chicken meat on top. Serve.\nNotes\nSilkie chickens are often sold cleaned, but with their collagen-rich feet and head still attached; leave those parts on for a silkier soup.\nTake care not to confuse dried lily bulb (which is called for in this recipe) with dried lily bud.\nWhite soy sauce is a Japanese, light-colored soy sauce. While not a traditional Chinese ingredient, its light color and flavor work well with the soup.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe broth and chicken can be refrigerated together for up to 5 days. Reheat gently and prepare garnish shortly before serving.\nChinese\nStovetop Chicken\nWhole Chicken\nChicken Mains\nComfort Food",
