Line an 8- by 3-inch anodized aluminum cake pan with parchment (see our explanation and tutorial on\nhow to cut a parchment round\n) and grease lightly with pan spray.\nFor the Cake:\nIn a medium mixing bowl, combine brown sugar, Dutch cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda. Whisk until homogeneous, with no visible clumps of cocoa or baking soda (although a few lumps of brown sugar may remain), about 1 minute. Under-mixing will give the cake an uneven texture and rise, so don't rush this step.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhisk in olive oil, brewed coffee, eggs, and vanilla. When mixture is smooth and well emulsified, add whole wheat flour and continue mixing only until combined. Scrape into prepared pan. Bake until cake is firm but your finger can still leave an impression in the puffy crust, about 25 minutes. (A toothpick inserted into the center should come away with a few crumbs still attached.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCool cake directly in pan for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off parchment, and place cake right side up on a serving platter or cake stand. Serve plain, with a sprinkling of powdered sugar, or with fresh fruit.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk\n,\n8- by 3-inch anodized aluminum cake pan\nNotes\nAs the cake's chocolate flavor comes from Dutch cocoa powder alone, it's important to reach for a high-quality brand that's rich in cocoa butter. Steer clear of low-fat supermarket brands, or those that blend natural and Dutch styles.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nWrapped tightly in plastic, the cake will keep for 2 or 3 days at cool room temperature.\nRead More\nOlive Oil Cake\nVegan Brownies\nCakes\nChocolate\nDairy-free\nDairy-free Desserts\nEaster Desserts",
