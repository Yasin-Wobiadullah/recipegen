Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it registers 225 to 250\u00b0F on an instant-read or deep-fry thermometer (chicken should be gently bubbling). Continue to cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 225 to 250\u00b0F until chicken is cooked through and skin is tender but not crisp or browned, about 20 minutes total. Transfer chicken with a wire mesh spider to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels. Allow chicken to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or cover and rest in the fridge for up to three nights. Proceed with Step 3.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nOven Method:\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 225\u00b0F. Place oil and chicken wings in a large oven-safe Dutch oven. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it registers 200\u00b0F on an instant-read or deep-fry thermometer. Cover pot and transfer to oven. Cook until chicken wings are tender but not browned, 40 minutes to 1 hour (chicken should be tender but not falling apart). Remove pot from oven. Transfer chicken with a wire mesh spider to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels. Allow chicken to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or cover and rest in the fridge for up to three nights. Proceed with Step 3.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nWhen ready to serve, combine butter and Frank's in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter is completely melted. Transfer to a large bowl. Heat oil to 400\u00b0F. Carefully add one third of chicken and cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 375 to 400\u00b0F until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to bowl with sauce, toss to coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and celery. Repeat with remaining batches, serving one batch at a time.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nwok\n, or chicken fryer\nNotes\nThe stove-top method is faster and easier for some folks, but the oven method will get you slightly moister end results.\nChicken wings can be frozen after step 1. To freeze chicken, place on a large plate or rimmed baking sheet, separating each piece. Freeze until solid, then transfer chicken pieces to a zipper-lock freezer bag. Keep frozen for up to 2 months. To cook from frozen, remove as many as you'd like to cook from the freezer and allow them to thaw at room temperature for at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours before continuing with step 2.\nTo serve all the chicken at once instead of in batches, transfer chicken directly from the fryer in step 3 to a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and place in a 200\u00b0F oven while you cook the remaining batches. Toss all the chicken with the sauce at once and serve.\nChicken Wings\nSnacks & Appetizers\nGame Day",
