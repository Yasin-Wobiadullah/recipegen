After roasting, remove from pan to slice open, then remove and discard the stem and seeds. Cover the chilies in boiling water and let soften for 5 minutes. In a blender or food processor, puree the chiles with enough soaking liquid to form a thick paste.\nHeat the skillet again over medium-high heat, then add the olive oil. Saute the onion and garlic until translucent, about 3 minutes. Increase the heat and add the beef, stirring occasionally to pick up browned bits on the bottom of the pan as the moisture evaporates, about 15 minutes. If the meat is excessively fatty (your judgement call), spoon off some of the fat, but leave some for flavor.\nStir in the cumin and cook for 30 seconds. Add the chile paste, red pepper flakes, oregano, bay leaf, jalape\u00f1os, and the remaining teaspoon of salt. Stir to combine well.\nAdd the tomatoes and beer and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the beans and cook for an additional 20 minutes. Add water if needed for consistency. Serve with preferred condiments.\nChili"
