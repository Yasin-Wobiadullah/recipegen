In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat until shimmering, then, working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan, sear fish until lightly golden on each side but not cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side (add more oil if skillet runs dry). Transfer partially cooked fish to a plate and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a 3-quart saucepan, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nAdd diced tomato and cook until softened and its liquid evaporates, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 4 cups water and bring to a boil. Add fish and cook at a gentle simmer, adjusting heat as necessary to maintain simmer, until fish is just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer fish to a serving plate and keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nAdd wedged tomatoes and fish sauce to the broth, increase heat to medium high, and return to a boil. Cook until tomatoes are heated through. Season with salt to taste and add rice vinegar or lime juice, if needed (the broth should be mildly sour, with some subtle sweetness).\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nFor the Dipping Sauce and to Serve:\nIn a small bowl, combine fish sauce and chile and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nTo serve, ladle broth into a large serving bowl, then garnish with dill. Serve hot with fish, rice, and dipping sauce.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch nonstick skillet, 3-quart saucepan\nNotes\nThis recipe is flexible and can accommodate different varieties of fish (carp, tilapia, snapper, salmon, etc.).\nI find Thai fish sauce saltier and more pungent than Vietnamese, which can affect the saltiness of the soup. However, you don't have to specifically source Vietnamese fish sauce just to make this soup, just be aware of the saltiness level if you use Thai fish sauce and adjust accordingly.\nVietnamese\nSoutheast Asian\nSoups\nFish\nAsian"
