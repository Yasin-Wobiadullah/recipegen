  "full_text": "Baking With Dorie: Corniest Corn Muffins Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nTotal\n35 mins\nServes\n12 muffins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nall-purpose flour\n1\ncup\ncornmeal\n6\ntablespoons\nsugar\n2 1/2\nteaspoons\nbaking powder\n1/4\nteaspoon\nbaking soda\n1/2\nteaspoon\nsalt\nPinch\nfreshly grated nutmeg\n(optional)\n1\ncup\nbuttermilk\n3\ntablespoons\n(\n1 1/2\nounces\n)\nunsalted butter\n, melted and cooled\n3\ntablespoons\ncorn oil\n1\nlarge\negg\n1\nlarge\negg yolk\n1/3\ncup\ncorn kernels\n(add up to 1/3 cup more if you\u2019d like), fresh, frozen or canned (in which case they should be drained and patted dry)\nDirections\nGetting ready:\nCenter a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Butter or spray the 12 muffin molds in a regular-size muffin tin, or fit the molds with paper muffin cups.\nWorking in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg. In a large glass measuring cup with a spout or in another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter, oil, egg and yolk. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and, with the whisk or a rubber spatula, gently but quickly stir to blend. Don\u2019t worry about being thorough \u2013 the batter will be lumpy and that\u2019s just the way it should be. Stir in the corn kernels. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin molds.\nSlide the pan into the oven and bake 15 to 18 minutes, or until the tops are golden and a knife inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Pull the pan from the oven and carefully lift each muffin out of its mold and onto a rack to cool.\nServing:\nThe muffins are great warm or at room temperature and particularly great split, toasted and slathered with butter or jam or both (if they\u2019re not in breadbasket at dinner, that is).\nStoring:\nLike all muffins, these are best eaten the day they are made. If you want to keep them, it\u2019s best to wrap them airtight and pop them into the freezer, where they\u2019ll keep for about a month; re-warm in a 300\u00b0F oven, if you\u2019d like, or split them and toast them\u2014do that and they\u2019ll be that much more delicious with butter.\nMuffins\nAmerican\nButtermilk\nCorn\nQuick Breakfast",
