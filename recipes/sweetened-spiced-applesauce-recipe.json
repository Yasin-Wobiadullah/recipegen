This will yield approximately 3 1/2 pounds prepared fruit (16 cups; 1.5kg). Transfer to a 5-quart Dutch oven, along with sugar, salt, apple cider vinegar, orange peel, and cinnamon stick. Stir to combine, then cover and place over medium heat until apples have wilted and begun to bubble in their own juices, about 15 minutes. If this process seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nContinue cooking, stirring from time to time, until apples are fall-apart tender, about 10 minutes more. Remove orange peel and cinnamon stick, then pur\u00e9e to your desired consistency with an immersion blender or food processor (see notes). If desired, thin as needed with apple cider to adjust consistency. For a more intense apple flavor, season with 1/4 teaspoon rose water.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer applesauce to glass jars and refrigerate up to 3 weeks. If freezing, make certain not to overfill the containers, as the applesauce will expand once frozen.\nSpecial Equipment\n5-quart enameled Dutch oven\n, heat-resistant spatula,\nimmersion blender\nNotes\nThe texture of the finished applesauce depends entirely on how it's blended; for best results, use a high-powered immersion blender. I've had excellent results using the All-Clad stainless steel immersion blender.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nApplesauce can be refrigerated up to 3 weeks or frozen. Just make sure if you're freezing to leave at least an inch of headroom, as the applesauce will expand once frozen.\nRead More\nHomemade Caramel Apples\nThe Best Way to Prevent Cut Apples From Browning\nTarte Tatin\nEasy, Old-Fashioned Apple Pie\nApple\nStovetop\nCondiments & Sauces",
