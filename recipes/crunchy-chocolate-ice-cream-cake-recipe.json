  "full_text": "Famous Wafer Chocolate Ice Cream Cake Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nFreezing Time\n3 hrs\nTotal\n3 hrs 10 mins\nServes\n12\nto 14 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nboxes\nNabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers\n10\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n, melted\n2\ntablespoons\ngranulated sugar\n3\nquarts\nchocolate ice cream\n, softened (see note)\nDirections\nPlace wafers from one box of chocolate wafers in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely crushed (see notes). Transfer to a large bowl and stir in butter and sugar until moistened. Press mixture into the bottom of a 9- to 10-inch springform pan.\nSet aside 6 wafers from the second box. Spoon 3 cups ice cream into pan and smooth top. Place 9 wafers on top of ice cream in even layer. Keep alternating 3 cups ice cream and 9 wafers two more times, ending with an ice cream layer on top. (You should have 3 layers of wafers and 4 layers of ice cream).\nCut reserved cookies in half and stick cookie cut side down into ice cream around the top perimeter. Freeze cake until completely solid, about 3 hours. Run a hot wet knife along inside of pan to loosen, and serve. Run a heavy duty knife under hot water before slicing the cake.\nSpecial Equipment\n9 or 10-inch springform pan, food processor\nNotes\nFor the creamiest results, use a high quality ice cream. Chocolate, of course, is not the only ice cream flavor that works here. Customize your cake by using your favorite ice cream flavor (preferably one that will complement the chocolate wafers).\nIf you don't have a food processor, you can crush the wafers by placing them in a zip-lock bag and using a rolling pin to pound the bag.\nRead More\nMocha Mascarpone Icebox Cake Recipe\nIntroducing the Ultimate 4-Layer, Candy-Packed Halloween Ice Cream Cake\nBlackberry Pistachio Icebox Cake Recipe\nIce Cream\nAmerican\nIcebox Cake\nNo-Cook Desserts\nChocolate"
