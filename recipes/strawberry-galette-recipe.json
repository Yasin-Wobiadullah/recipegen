In a large bowl, whisk together sugar and starch. Add berries and toss to coat with dry mixture. Line a sheet pan with parchment and place the dough sheet on top. Pile strawberry mixture in the center, leaving at least 3 inches of dough uncovered on all sides. Fold overhang back up around fruit, encasing it on all sides, folding it into rustic pleats to gather up excess. Chill shaped galette in fridge for 1/2 hour.\nRemove chilled galette from fridge and brush exposed dough with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar if desired. Place the sheet tray on the prepared rack and bake for 20 minutes, turning halfway through. Lower the temperature to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and bake for 20-30 additional minutes, until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling all over. Remove from oven and allow galette to cool completely before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nRolling pin, stand mixer\nThis Recipe Appears In\nPie of the Week: Strawberry Galette\nPies\nBaked Fruit\nStrawberry\nSummer Desserts"
