Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Spray an 8-inch square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.\nIn large mixing bowl, whisk together rice flour, granulated sugar, tapioca starch, baking powder, and salt. In a measuring cup or a small bowl, whisk together buttermilk and lemon zest. Pour buttermilk mixture over dry ingredients. Whisk in vegetable oil and eggs until smooth.\nPour batter into prepared cake pan. Bake until a cake tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes.\nOption 1: Simple Syrup Glaze\nMeanwhile, if making the Simple-Syrup Glaze, combine granulated sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring gently until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low and cook syrup until it thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.\nWhile cake is still warm, poke it all over with a fork. Brush top of cake with syrup and allow to absorb fully, about 5 minutes. Repeat until all syrup is absorbed.\nOption 2: Powdered Sugar Glaze\nIf making Powdered Sugar Glaze, allow cake to cool completely. In small bowl, combine powdered sugar and lemon juice. Stir with a fork until smooth. Icing should be thick but spreadable; if the icing is too thick, add a little more lemon juice. Spread icing on cake and allow to set for 15 minutes before serving.\nStore cake, covered, on the counter for up to 3 days.\nNotes\nSelect one glaze to finish the cake. The simple syrup glaze changes the texture of the cake a little, making it damp, while the powdered sugar icing leaves the coffee cake-like texture intact. If desired, toss together 1 cup washed berries, like blueberries, with 1 tablespoon white rice flour. Stir coated berries into the finished batter and bake as directed.\nSpecial Equipment\n8-inch square baking pan\nThis Recipe Appears In\nGluten-Free All Day Lemon Cake With a Choice of Toppings\nCakes\nGluten-free Desserts\nSheet Cake\nLemon",
