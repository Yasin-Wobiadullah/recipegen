Store in refrigerator in air-tight container for up to two weeks.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nNotes\nThis mayonnaise can be made with vegetable oil in place of the rendered animal fat - though flavor will suffer.\nFor insurance, I add jarred mayonnaise to the food processor at the start, which makes it easier to create a stable emulsion.
