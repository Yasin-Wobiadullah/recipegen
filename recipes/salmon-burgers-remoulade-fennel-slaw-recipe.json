Stir well, then season with salt and pepper. (You can cook a very small amount in a nonstick skillet to check salt levels, and then adjust accordingly). Set in refrigerator.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the R\u00e9moulade:\nIn a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, capers, cornichons, herbs, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and horseradish until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to refrigerator.\nFor the Slaw:\nIn a medium bowl, combine celery root, radicchio, and fennel. Drizzle with just enough olive oil to coat and sprinkle with lemon juice to taste. Set aside.\nFor Cooking and Serving:\nSpread panko bread crumbs in a shallow bowl or pie plate, and arrange a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Divide salmon mixture into 4 even portions and, working one at a time, roll each into a ball, then flatten into a 1-inch thick patty, using your hands to smooth out any cracked edges (they may squirm around on you a little, but keep at it and they'll come together).\nPlace each patty in the bowl of bread crumbs, use your hands to sprinkle more bread crumbs on top, then press down gently to make bread crumbs adhere to the bottom side. Flip patty and press gently once more, then transfer to the parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining salmon.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd oil to a large cast iron skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Carefully lower salmon patties into the oil and cook, turning once or twice, until lightly browned on both sides and medium-rare within (about 115 to 120\u00b0F or 46 to 49\u00b0C on an instant-read thermometer), about 10 minutes; adjust heat as necessary to keep things sizzling without scorching the bread crumbs.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer patties to a paper towel-lined tray and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. Smear an even layer of r\u00e9moulade on the top and bottom halves of each bun. Set a salmon patty on top of each bottom bun. Season slaw with salt and pepper, then mound some on top of each patty. Close sandwiches and serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet\n, thin metal spatula or\nfish spatula\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nEasy Salmon Burgers With Dill Honey-Mustard, Horseradish, and Avocado\nMini Pineapple-Teriyaki-Glazed Salmon Burgers With Avocado\nBurgers\nStovetop Seafood\nSalmon\nSandwiches\nQuick Dinners"
