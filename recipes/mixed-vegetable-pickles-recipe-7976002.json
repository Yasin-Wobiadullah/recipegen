If using, add a large pinch of red pepper flakes and 2 fresh grape leaves to each jar. Top with additional cabbage, packing to compress, until jars are full. Note: You will have leftovers of each vegetable, which can be reserved for another use (such as roasted in the oven).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a large vessel or mixing bowl, stir together water, vinegar, and salt until salt is fully dissolved. Slowly pour the brine into each jar until vegetables are completely submerged. Use a paring knife to remove any large air bubbles by gently sliding it into the jars.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSeal the jars tightly and set on plates to catch any potential overflow. Store the jars at room temperature, away from direct sunlight, until brine ferments and becomes pleasantly sour and refreshingly tangy, about 1 to 2 weeks; throughout the fermentation process, you should notice bubbles forming and the brine becoming cloudy. Discard the pickles if any off aromas or flavors develop or if the pickles become slimy. Surface molds can sometimes grow during fermentation and are typically harmless, though they should be scraped off; that said, it's better to discard the pickle if in doubt about its safety.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nStore pickles in the refrigerator until ready to eat; flavors will continue to meld and improve over time as the pickle sits.\nSpecial Equipment\nTwo 1-quart (1L) glass canning jars\nNotes\nYou can experiment with different vegetable combinations based on the season and your preferences. Enjoy the pickles, and don't forget to savor the brine, as is customary in Turkish cuisine.\nCabbage\nThe Latest\nFood History\nCanning & Preserving",
