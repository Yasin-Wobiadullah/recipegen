Cook, smashing berries with potato masher or whisk, until dark, syrupy mash has formed, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon lemon zest and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Add more sugar to taste, if needed. Compote should be sweet and tart. Set aside.\nFor the Lemon Ricotta:\nCombine ricotta and remaining 2 teaspoons lemon zest in bowl and stir with spoon. Add a few splashes of milk, if necessary, to adjust mixture to a consistency that is not runny but spreads very slowly when you pile it up with a spoon. Set aside.\nFor the French Toast:\nSet wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C). If using very fresh, moist bread, arrange slices in a single layer on rack and cook in oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and cardamom or nutmeg until thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.\nHeat 1 tablespoon (15g) butter in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat, swirling skillet, until foaming subsides, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, soak 2 slices of bread in egg bath, turning, until saturated. Add soaked bread to skillet and cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle top side of bread with sugar, flip, and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer French toast to rack in oven, arranging in a single layer, to keep warm. Repeat with remaining slices of bread and egg bath.\nServe French toast with ricotta and compote spooned on top. Garnish with more lemon zest, if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nPotato masher or whisk; wire rack; rimmed baking sheet; large nonstick or cast iron skillet, spatula\nNotes\nLook for ricotta made without any gums or stabilizers, which produce a shelf-stable product with poor texture and flavor. Or\nmake your own\n.\nRead More\nPerfect Quick-and-Easy French Toast\nOrange-Rum Challah French Toast With Whipped Cream\nHomemade Ricotta\nFrench Toast\nStovetop\nRicotta\nBlackberry\nQuick Breakfast",
