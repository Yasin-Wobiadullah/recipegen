Prepare an ice bath. Working with one vegetable at a time, cook asparagus stalks, asparagus tips, snap peas, fava beans, and zucchini by adding to water and cooking until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes (taste as they cook to confirm doneness). Transfer to ice bath to stop cooking, then drain and transfer to a bowl. Carefully peel skins off of fava beans. Set all vegetables aside while you prepare the risotto.\nAdd mushrooms to a microwave-safe bowl and cover with 1 quart of vegetable blanching water. Microwave on high heat until just starting to simmer, about 5 minutes. Let steep for 10 minutes, then remove mushrooms and carefully dry with paper towels. Reserve mushroom liquid.\nCombine rice and mushroom liquid in a large bowl. Agitate rice with fingers or a whisk to release starch. Strain through a fine mesh strainer set in a 2-quart liquid cup measure or other large bowl. Allow to drain five minutes, stirring rice occasionally. Reserve liquid.\nHeat 3 tablespoons olive oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add rice and cook, stirring and tossing frequently until all liquid is evaporated, oil is bubbling, and rice has begun to take on a golden blond color and nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and shallots and continue to cook, stirring frequently until aromatic, about 1 minute. Give reserved broth a good stir and pour all but one cup over the rice. Increase heat to high and heat until simmering. Stir rice once, cover, and reduce heat to lowest possible setting.\nCook rice for ten minutes undisturbed. Stir once, shake pan gently to redistribute rice, cover, and continue cooking until liquid is mostly absorbed and rice is tender with just a faint bite, about 10 minutes longer.\nWhile rice is cooking, heat remaining tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add dried mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until faintly nutty and crisp in bits, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and transfer to a plate.\nRemove lid from rice and add final cup of liquid. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring and shaking rice constantly until thick and creamy. Fold in vegetables, mushrooms, parsley, and lemon juice and zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add water just until risotto is creamy and loose. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nI prefer using Carnaroli rice for its slight longer grains and firmer texture. Feel free to use any risotto-style rice like Arborio or Vailone Nano.\nFava Beans\nRice & Grains\nAsparagus\nMorel Mushroom\nZucchini & Yellow Squash",
