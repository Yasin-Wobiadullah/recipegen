  "full_text": "Mediterranean Flavors: Roasted Red Pepper Spread Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n30 mins\nCooling Time\n5 mins\nTotal\n45 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nlarge\nred peppers\n, cut in half lengthwise and seeds removed\n2\ncups\npecans\nor walnuts, finely chopped\n1\ncup\nstale bread\ncut into 1/4 inch cubes\n1/2\nsmall\nred onion\n, if you like and aren\u2019t making this in advance\n1\nhandful\nchopped parsley\n3\ntablespoons\nnar ek\u015fisi\nSalt\n1/4\ncup\nextra-virgin olive oil\n; use more or less as needed\nDirections\nSpread some olive oil on a roasting pan and roast the peppers in a 450\u00b0F oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the skins are blackened and the flesh offers no resistance to a knife. You can also\nroast the peppers whole over a gas stove.\nWhen the peppers have cooled enough to handle, remove most of the blackened skins, but leave some on if you like for a charred flavor. Roughly dice the peppers, then transfer them to a large cutting board with the other dry ingredients. Run across it all with a sharp knife until you have a slightly cohesive mass with chunks smaller than peas. Don\u2019t over-mince. You can do this in a food processor, but go with brief pulses and the understanding that you may have to do the last bit of mincing by hand.\nTransfer the mixture to a large bowl and add the nar ek\u015fisi and salt to taste. Drizzle in enough olive oil to make a cohesive mass. Let the bread soak in the juices for a couple minutes, then serve.\nDips\nMediterranean\nRoasted Vegetables\nPecans\nRed Pepper",
