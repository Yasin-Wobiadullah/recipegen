Meanwhile, in saucepot, heat the cream, butter, vanilla pod, and 1 teaspoon of smoked salt until it just simmers.\nSwirl the sugar mixture until it turns the color of caramel. Careful, one minute it\u2019s so clear you think you can walk away, the next, it\u2019s burnt.\nStand back and add the warm cream mixture. It will bubble up violently. Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture reads 248 degrees F on a candy thermometer.\nPour into the prepared baking dish, and refrigerate until firm.

Cut each log into 8 equal pieces, and top lightly with more smoked salt.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Secret Ingredient: Smoked Salt\nCandy",
