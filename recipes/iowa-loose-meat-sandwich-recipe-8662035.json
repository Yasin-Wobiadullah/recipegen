Add the ground beef and mix to combine. Let sit for 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the remaining 1 tablespoon water with cornstarch; set aside. In a separate small bowl, combine stock, black pepper, salt, red pepper flakes, and MSG, if using. Mix well and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan or stainless-steel skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over high heat until shimmering. Add beef and grated onion and cook, stirring frequently and breaking the beef into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until most of the beef is no longer pink and onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in the stock mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add the cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened and coats the ground beef, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSeparate the buns and place a slice of American cheese on each bottom half. Using a slotted spoon, top cheese with about 1/4 of the loose meat filling (about 4 ounces per sandwich) and press gently to compact. Top with 2 to 3 dill pickle chips and mustard. Place the top buns on, squish to compact the layers, and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial-Equipment\nLarge saut\u00e9 pan or stainless-steel skillet\nNotes\nA potato roll is ideal, but any burger bun is fine, and using whatever you can get (within reason) is more true to the tradition than going to three stores looking for potato rolls.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou\ncan\nmake the meat ahead of time, storing it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. We don't recommend it. The meat takes under half an hour (and minimal effort) to prep and cook combined, and it'll never be better or juicier than when it's fresh. Likewise, any leftover cooked meat can be stored in a tightly sealed container in the fridge for up to four days.\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nBeef Mains\nGround Beef"
