In a 2-quart stainless steel saucier, combine basil-sugar with salt, white chocolate, and approximately one-third of the milk. Warm over medium heat, stirring constantly with a flexible spatula, until the white chocolate has fully dissolved and the mixture is hot to the touch, but not simmering. Remove from heat, add prepared gelatin, and stir until fully melted.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing a fine-mesh strainer set over a large heat-proof bowl, strain mixture, pressing on the basil solids with a flexible spatula to extract as much liquid as possible without forcing the pulp through the sieve; discard basil solids. Stir in the remaining milk, then cover and refrigerate until firm and cold, about 3 hours or to a temperature of 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Alternatively, the mixture can be refrigerated for up to 12 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the chilled base on medium speed until creamy and smooth, about 90 seconds; if needed, use a flexible spatula to remove any remaining lumps by smearing them against the side of the bowl. Scrape the smooth base back into its original bowl.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd the cream to the stand mixer bowl (no need to wash) and whip with the whisk attachment until thick and stiff, about 3 minutes, although this will vary depending on the power of the mixer. Once thick, roughly fold approximately half the whipped cream into the basil mixture; then add the remainder and fold gently to combine. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag, snip off 1/4-inch from the tip, then pipe into serving dishes. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour, or until needed, up to 12 hours. Serve with fresh fruit, sliced and macerated with sugar to taste, and/or nuts if you'd like.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, 2-quart stainless steel\nsaucier\n,\nnon-reactive fine-mesh strainer\n,\nstand mixer\nNotes\nAmerican gelatin powder is formulated to a relatively consistent bloom strength, so any brand will do. Gelatin derived from beef, such as that manufactured by Now Foods, tends to have a milder aroma, and the bulk packaging helps drive down the cost.\nRead More\nLemon Mousse\nLight and Silky Banana Cr\u00e9meux\nLight and Easy 5-Minute Fruit Mousse\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nStovetop\nBasil\nEaster Desserts\nMother's Day"
