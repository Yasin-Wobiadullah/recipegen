In a small saucepan set over medium heat, heat olive oil until shimmering, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, shallot, anchovies, rosemary, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots and garlic are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a small heatproof\u00a0 bowl. Stir in salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nRub half of the mixture inside butterflied lamb leg. Roll leg and, using butcher\u2019s twine, tie securely at 1-inch intervals. Rub remaining mixture over exterior of lamb. Cook immediately or let rest uncovered in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours for best flavor and texture.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nWhen ready to cook, place lamb, fat side up, on a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest section of lamb registers 125\u00b0F to 130\u00b0F (52\u00b0 to 54\u00b0C) for medium-rare, or 130\u00b0F to 135\u00b0F for medium (54\u00b0 to 57\u00b0C), 2 1/2\u00a0 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and let rest, uncovered, for 40 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nWhile lamb is resting, increase oven temperature to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). Return lamb to oven and roast until exterior is deep brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest 5 minutes. Remove twine with kitchen shears, transfer lamb to cutting board, slice into 1/4 inch slices, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n, butcher's twine,\nwire cooling rack\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Leg of Lamb\nSichuan Roast Leg of Lamb With Celery-Mint Salad\nSous Vide Leg of Lamb With Mint, Cumin, and Black Mustard\nSous Vide Leg of Lamb With Black Olives\nRotisserie Boneless Leg of Lamb With Lemon, Rosemary, and Garlic\nGrilled Butterflied Leg of Lamb With Rosemary, Garlic, and Mustard Crust\nLeg of Lamb\nLamb\nRoasted Lamb\nEaster\nChristmas Dinners"
