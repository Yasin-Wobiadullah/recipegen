In a medium saucepan, heat oil to 325\u00b0F (160\u00baC) over medium-high heat and adjust flame to maintain temperature as needed. Add shallots and cook, stirring constantly with a slotted spoon or wire mesh spider, until shallots are a pale golden and barely turning brown in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately transfer to the prepared plate to drain. Reserve 1 tablespoon oil, and discard remaining oil or reserve for another use. Once shallots are cool and firm, lightly crush; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat reserved 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork belly and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and crushed fried shallots to Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add sugar and five-spice powder and stir to combine. Add water, wine, dark and light soy sauce, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, covered partially, until pork is tender and sauce has thickened, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Serve with steamed rice and hard-boiled eggs.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nSlotted spoon or spider, large\nDutch oven\nNotes\nYou can make your own five-spice powder by combining 1/4 teaspoon each ground cloves, Sichuan peppercorns, and fennel seed, plus 1 cinnamon stick and 1 clove star anise.\nIf using whole pork belly, trim any bones from the slab of meat. Slice into 1/4-inch slices lengthwise, then slice each piece into 1/4-inch slivers.\nRead More\nTaiwanese Pork Belly Bun (Gua Bao)\nTaiwanese Turkey Rice\nPork Mains\nEast Asian\nPork Belly",
