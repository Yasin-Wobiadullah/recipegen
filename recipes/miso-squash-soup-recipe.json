Reduce to a bare simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, let cool for 5 minutes, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer. Discard solids and set dashi aside.\nIn a large Dutch oven or soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add leek, carrot, garlic, and sliced ginger. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are glistening and just starting to turn tender, about 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd squash and pour just enough dashi on top to cover vegetables. Bring to a simmer and cook until vegetables are fully tender, about 30 minutes. Using a standing blender or immersion blender, and working in batches if necessary, blend soup until very smooth. Blend in miso and lemon juice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReturn soup to pot and thin with enough water to reach a pourable, silky-smooth consistency. Season with salt, add sugar to taste, and keep warm.\nMeanwhile, fill a medium bowl with 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Add diced apple and let soak for 10 minutes. Drain apple well, then return to bowl. Toss with grated ginger, scallions, toasted sesame seeds, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Season with salt, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo serve, ladle hot soup into bowls and top with the apple-scallion salad. Garnish with shichimi togarashi, if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n,\nblender\nNotes\nKombu and bonito flakes (katsuobushi) can be found in any Japanese market or in the international section of most well-stocked supermarkets. For best results, use real kombu and bonito flakes. Alternatively, you can use\npowdered dashi mix\n; follow the instructions on the package.\nShichimi togarashi\nis a Japanese spice blend made with chile powder, sansho pepper, dried orange peel, ginger, and black sesame seeds.\nRead More\nDashi 101: A Guide to the Umami-Rich Japanese Stock\nA Guide to Winter Squash: How to Choose, Store, and Cook Your Gourds\nClassic Butternut Squash Soup Recipe\nMexican Butternut Squash Soup With Ancho Chile, Crema, and Pepitas Recipe\nQuick and Easy Stovetop Butternut Squash Soup Recipe\nDairy-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop\nApple",
