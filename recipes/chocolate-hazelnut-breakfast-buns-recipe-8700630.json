Melt butter in a 2-quart saucier over low heat, then stir in milk and yogurt, warming to about 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C). Add butter/milk/yogurt mixture to flour mixture and stir to form a very dry and shaggy dough. Using hook attachment, knead dough on low until silky-smooth and elastic, capable of being gently stretched into a thin but rough sheet without tearing, about 20 minutes.\nFirst Rise: Cover bowl with plastic and set dough to rise until puffy, light, and doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours at roughly 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). If dough feels dense, firm, or overly resilient (this is more likely in chilly months), let rest 15 more minutes before testing again.\nShaping: Turn dough onto lightly floured surface, dust with flour, and roll into 13-inch square. Spread homemade Nutella over dough in even layer, using offset spatula. Sprinkle hazelnuts on top and roll into a log, ending seam side down.\nSlide an 8-inch strand of thread, unflavored dental floss, or butcher's twine under dough log until you reach the middle. Cross ends over the top and pull tight to divide log in two. Cut each half into 6 one-inch slices and arrange in parchment-lined 9- by 13- by 2-inch aluminum baking pan (or two 8-inch by 3-inch round cake pans).\nSecond Rise and Frosting: Cover rolls with foil and refrigerate overnight, or up to 48 hours. Meanwhile, prepare frosting by combining mascarpone, cream, sugar, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment. Whip on medium speed until sugar is dissolved and frosting is fluffy, thick, and capable of holding medium-soft peaks. If necessary, season with additional salt and/or vanilla to taste. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag or other airtight container and refrigerate until needed, up to 48 hours.\nTo Bake and Serve: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Meanwhile, let buns stand at room temperature until oven is hot. When oven is hot, bake, covered, until buns are puffed and firm but pale, about 30 minutes. (If using darker pans, check on the buns a little sooner.) Remove foil and continue baking until buns are lightly browned, about 15 minutes more. Snip a corner from bag of frosting and squeeze over each bun; alternatively, spoon frosting over buns. Serve immediately, as buns do not hold up well over time.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n, 2-quart saucier, flexible spatula,\ndigital thermometer\n,\noffset spatula\n, unflavored dental floss or butcher\u2019s twine, 9- by 13- by 2-inch anodized-aluminum baking pan or two 8-inch anodized-aluminum cake pans (preferably 3 inches deep)\nNotes\nInstant yeast doesn't require hydration prior to use and is suitable for cold fermentation, making it distinct from both active dry and rapid-rise yeast. My favorite brand is SAF red-label instant yeast, which is higher quality than anything found in supermarkets, and dramatically cheaper when bought in bulk.\nGreek yogurt is traditionally thickened by straining, giving it a low-moisture/high-protein makeup. Look for brands that contain only milk and active cultures, and avoid those artificially thickened with gum, gelatin, or pectin, as these will ruin the texture of the dough.\nThis recipe was tested with our\nhomemade Nutella\n, and will not necessarily behave the same way with commercial alternatives, which may require adaptation.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe prepared but unbaked buns can be refrigerated up to 48 hours in a foil-covered pan. If the pan is wrapped tightly in plastic, they can also be frozen for several months. To use, thaw overnight at room temperature and proceed with the recipe as directed when it's time to bake.\nRolls & Buns\nBaking\nHazelnuts"
