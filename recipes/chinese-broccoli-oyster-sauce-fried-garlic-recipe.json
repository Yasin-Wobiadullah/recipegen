  "full_text": "Chinese Broccoli With Oyster Sauce and Fried Garlic Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n25 mins\nTotal\n20 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nwhole head\ngarlic\n, peeled\nKosher salt\n1/4\ncup\nvegetable, peanut, or\ncanola oil\n1\nteaspoon\nsesame oil\n1\ntablespoon\noyster sauce\n10\nounces\nChinese broccoli\nDirections\nTransfer garlic to the bowl of a food processor or mini food processor. Pulse until garlic is very finely chopped but not a paste, about 12 short pulses, scraping down sides as necessary. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and toss to combine.\nSet a fine-mesh strainer over a heat-proof bowl. Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly. Garlic should maintain a very gentle bubble. If bubbling vigorously, reduce heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is pale golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, then immediately strain (do not overcook, as the garlic will continue to darken as it rests). Transfer garlic to a paper towel-lined plate to cool. Reserve fried garlic and oil separately.\nIn a small bowl combine 1 teaspoon of reserved garlic oil, sesame oil, and the oyster sauce. Mix well until combined, then add 1 tablespoon hot water. Stir and set aside. Reserve remaining garlic oil for another use.\nSerious Eats / Shao Z.\nBring a large pot of water to boil. Add the Chinese broccoli and blanch until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain really well on paper towels or in a salad spinner and place on a serving platter. Drizzle the mixed oyster sauce on top and sprinkle with the fried garlic. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Shao Z.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nRead More\nChinese Greens 101: Three Basic Cooking Techniques for Chinese Greens\nStir-Fried Beef With Chinese Broccoli\nStir-Fried Choy Sum With Minced Garlic\nChinese\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop Vegetables\nBroccoli\nGarlic",
