Toss vegetables, then return to oven for another 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd rice to a medium bowl, drizzle with soy sauce, fish sauce, and sesame oil, and toss to coat.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd rice to the sheet pan, mix with the vegetables, then spread in an even, single layer. Roast, stirring once halfway through, until the rice begins to toast on the outer edges, about 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd the frozen peas, stir to distribute evenly, and return to oven until peas are heated through and the rice is crispy and chewy, but not burnt, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, top rice with fried egg, if using, and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nFor the best results, use Chinese-style medium-grain rice, jasmine rice, or sushi rice. Rice should either be cooked fresh, spread on a tray, and allowed to steam-dry for 20 minutes, or, alternatively, transferred to a loosely covered container and refrigerated for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. Break large rice clumps up with your hands before beginning.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe fried rice is best made right before serving.\nRecipes\nThe Latest\nWhite Rice\nRice & Grain Mains",
