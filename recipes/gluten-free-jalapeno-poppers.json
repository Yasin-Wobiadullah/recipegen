Using the handle of a spoon, remove seeds and ribs under cool running water. Take care not to split peppers. It\u2019s a good idea to wear gloves during this step. And be sure to avoid touching face and eyes.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nIn a small bowl, cream together cream cheese, cheddar, bacon, and scallions. Fit pastry bag with #12 round top or cut a medium opening in a disposable bag. Fill pastry bag. Pipe filling into peppers. If any filling oozes out of the peppers, wipe it away with a paper towel.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nFreeze peppers for 10 minutes. Line up three pie pans or rimmed plates on your counter. On the first, place the white rice flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Stir with a fork to combine. On the next plate, whisk together eggs. On the last plate, combine breadcrumbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir to combine.\nOne at a time, roll peppers in white rice flour, coating completely. Then roll in whisked eggs and breadcrumbs. Return peppers to eggs and then, finally, to breadcrumbs. Be sure there are no bare spots on the peppers.\nSerious Eats / Elizabeth Barbone\nPlace peppers on large plate. Return to freezer for 10 minutes. In a heavy bottomed Dutch oven, heat oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Two or three at a time, fry peppers until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Allow to cool a few minutes before serving. Filling will be hot.\nSpecial Equipment\nDeep fryer\nNotes\nIf you have time, consider making the filling ahead of time. This allows the flavors to mingle. Be sure to allow the filling to come to room temperature before piping into peppers.\nRead More\nGluten-Free Mozzarella Sticks\nGluten-Free Hush Puppies\nCrispy Deep-Fried Jalape\u00f1o Poppers\nCrispy and Gooey Baked Jalape\u00f1o Poppers\nPulled Pork Jalape\u00f1o Poppers With Raspberry Sauce\nStuffed Jalape\u00f1os\nFrying",
