Heat the cast iron skillet for about a minute on medium heat. Slide in the ladyfingers and keep stirring, taking care not to break them. About 5 minutes, till they begin to discolor. When they have changed color and appear slightly limp, turn the heat to low and add the oil (stand clear if it splutters). Stir for about 30 seconds to mix through with the oil. Add the salt, coriander, red chile and turmeric powders. Stir to mix through for about 15 seconds. Let the ladyfingers cook untouched for the next 10 minutes, stirring once in between.
