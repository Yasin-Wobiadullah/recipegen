Add bread crumbs and toast, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined plate and season with salt.\nFor the Anchovy Vinaigrette:\nCombine ingredients in the cup of an immersion blender or canister of a blender and blend until a smooth emulsion is formed. Set aside.\nTo Assemble the Salad:\nCombine celery, fennel, and anchovy vinaigrette in a serving bowl. (If using multiple plates, divide celery, fennel, and anchovy vinaigrette evenly among bowls/plates. If you like, you can spoon the vinaigrette into the serving vessel to create a line of dressing around the rim, but this is entirely optional.) Toss vegetables until they are thoroughly coated in vinaigrette\u2014they will appear overdressed.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine radicchio, Belgian endive, and parsley. Season with salt, tossing to ensure even distribution. Add lemon juice and olive oil incrementally, tossing until vegetables are well-dressed but not dripping (you may not need all the lemon juice and oil).\nDistribute dressed radicchio, Belgian endive, and parsley salad in even layer over dressed celery and fennel. Sprinkle layer with flaky salt, toasted bread crumbs, and cheese. Repeat the process, creating another even layer of dressed radicchio, Belgian endive, and parsley salad, topped with coarse salt, toasted bread crumbs, and cheese. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion blender\n,\nlarge mixing bowl\nNotes\nThe number of anchovy fillets to include in this vinaigrette is up to you and is dependent on your tastes and the quality of anchovies. Higher-quality anchovies tend to be less aggressively salty. Keep in mind it's meant to have quite a strong anchovy flavor, but de gustibus non disputandum est, ya know?\nQuick Salads\nNo-Cook Salads\nFennel\nEndive, Radicchio & Chicories\nFall Salads",
