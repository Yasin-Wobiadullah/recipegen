While the food processor is running gradually add hot water until elastic dough forms, about 5 minutes. Place dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic and allow dough to double in volume, about 30 minutes\nPunch down dough on a floured work surface and divide into 8 pieces and shape into round buns. Slash tops of each bun with an \u2018X\u2019 using a serrated knife, cover with a towel and let rise until doubled again, about 25 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375[\u00b0]. Grease a baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add sugar and baking soda (the baking soda will make the water bubble heavily, so add it gradually). Boil each roll for 30 seconds, then flip and cook for another 30 seconds. Place on prepared baking sheet brush with egg white and sprinkle with salt. Bake until brown, about 25 minutes. Serve these rolls with thick sliced bacon, grainy mustard and Bavarian beer.\nSpecial Equipment\nBaking sheet, Food Processor\nYeast Breads\nRolls & Buns\nBreakfast & Brunch"
