Sprinkle lightly all over on both sides with salt, then let stand until eggplants look dewy with water and some water has dripped below, about 20 minutes. Blot well with clean towels to remove all excess water.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat olive oil with garlic clove over medium heat until garlic begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook until garlic is just beginning to turn golden, about 4 minutes. Remove garlic clove and discard. Add blended canned tomatoes (or passata) along with the basil and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, stirring often, until thickened and no longer watery (this may take almost no time at all for some passata products, or up to 20 minutes for waterier canned tomatoes). Remove from heat and season with salt. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a 12-inch cast iron or stainless-steel skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, fry eggplant, turning once, until golden on both sides. Carefully transfer to paper towels to drain well, blotting to soak up any excess oil as you go. Repeat with remaining eggplant, adding more oil to skillet if necessary. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare an ice bath in a large mixing bowl. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pot, boil lasagna noodles until just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than cooking instructions for fresh lasagna noodles or 3 minutes less than package instructions for dry lasagna noodles. Using a strainer and tongs, carefully transfer to ice bath to chill, then drain and blot lightly with towels. Repeat with remaining pasta.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and set rack in middle position. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk ricotta until very smooth and creamy. Season with salt.\nIn a 2-quart baking dish, spoon a thin layer of tomato sauce all over, spreading it evenly to coat bottom. Cutting cooked lasagna noodles as needed to fit the baking dish, arrange the pasta in a single, even layer. Dollop and gently spread a thin layer of ricotta all over pasta (it doesn't need to cover every inch, but should be evenly enough distributed that it will melt and spread when baked). Scatter a small handful of mozzarella all over, then pieces of fried eggplant in a single, even layer. Top with another thin layer of sauce, then a sprinkle of grated ricotta salata and a dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Repeat this layering until the baking dish is full, making sure to top the final layer of pasta only with tomato sauce, ricotta, ricotta salata, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. (Note: You may not use up all the components, but you should make sure to use all the eggplant and ricotta when layering the dish.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSet baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet (to catch any drips) and bake until fully heated through and lasagna is very lightly browned on top, about 30 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes to cool and settle, then slice and serve, sprinkling torn fresh basil leaves on top.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n2-quart baking dish\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe tomato sauce can be made up to 5 days ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container until ready to use.\nThe eggplant can be fried up to 2 hours ahead and set aside until ready to use.\nThe pasta can be boiled up to 5 hours ahead, but after chilling in the ice bath and draining, the pasta should be lightly rubbed with oil to prevent the noodles from sticking to each other, then placed in on a parchment-lined baking sheet, with layers of plastic wrap between the layers of pasta (once again, to prevent sticking).\nThe assembled lasagna can be wrapped with plastic and refrigerated for up to 1 day; remove plastic and bake according to the directions, though it may take longer to fully heat through. Check the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer\u2014you'll want to above 150\u00b0F in the center, or it may come out tepid.\nLeftover baked lasagna can be refrigerated in its dish wrapped in plastic (or in an airtight container)\u00a0for up to 5 days. Reheat in a 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) oven until warmed through, about 25 minutes (or microwave cut portions for a few minutes)\nLasagna\nThe Latest\nItalian"
