Take a small amount and flatten it between your palms. If the edges crack, knead in more water, a tablespoon at a time, until dough is supple and smooth but not sticky. Season dough to taste with salt, then cover and set aside for 5 minutes.\nDivide dough into 4 even pieces and roll into balls. Working on a wooden cutting board or a regular cutting board with a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper on top of it, flatten each ball down to a disk about 5 inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick.\nMelt butter in a 12-inch cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-low heat (see notes). Add arepas and cook, moving them around the pan and rotating them occasionally, until first side is charred in spots and a dry crust has formed, about 5 minutes. Flip arepas and cook on second side until a dry crust has formed, about 5 minutes longer. Continue cooking, flipping every minute or so, until arepas are mostly dry and relatively stiff, about 5 minutes longer. Serve hot with cheese, melted butter, or toppings of your choice.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch cast iron skillet\nor\nnonstick skillet\nNotes\nMasarepa is dehydrated cooked cornmeal. It is available in the Latin section of most supermarkets in either white or yellow varieties. This recipe calls for white, but they can be freely substituted. Popular brands include Goya and P.A.N.\nCrumbled cheese can be added if desired. Depending on the moisture level of the cheese, you may not need all the water. Colombian-style queso fresco is ideal. If you can't find it, substitute cotija, ricotta salata, or feta.\nArepas can also be cooked on a greased panini press or a grill over low heat.\nRead More\nCheese-Stuffed Colombian-Style Arepas\nVenezuelan-Style Arepas (Arepas Rellenas)\nVenezuelan-Style Arepas With Pulled Pork (Arepas Rumberas)\nColombian Cuisine\nQueso Fresco\nCornmeal\nSnacks & Appetizers\nColombian Cuisine"
