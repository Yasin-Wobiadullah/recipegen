Add onion, fennel, and celery, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and just beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and rosemary (if using), and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add wine and cook, swirling pan and scraping up any stuck-on bits with a wooden spoon, until wine is reduced by a third, about 30 seconds.\nAdd stock, season lightly with salt, and bring to a boil. Add the pork and pork drippings (if using), reduce heat to a gentle simmer, partially cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is fully tender and easily shreds apart when pressed with a wooden spoon, and liquid is reduced to a saucy consistency, about 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta. If using fresh pasta, cook until noodles are barely cooked through. If using dry pasta, cook until just shy of al dente (1 to 2 minutes less than the package directs). Using either tongs (for long fresh pasta) or a spider skimmer (for short pasta), transfer pasta to pan along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 2 cups (500ml) pasta cooking water.\nIncrease heat to medium-high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and coats noodles, about 1 minute, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed. Add the butter and stir and toss rapidly to melt and emulsify into the sauce. Remove from heat, add lemon juice and zest, and 3/4 of grated cheese, and stir rapidly to incorporate. Season with salt to taste. Divide pasta between individual serving bowls, garnish with reserved fennel fronds, and sprinkle with remaining grated cheese. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet with lid or\nDutch oven\n, tongs or spider skimmer\nNotes\nIf you happen to have saved pork bones from a\nslow-roasted pork shoulder\n, you can make a quick pork stock by simmering the bones with 10 cups of water, 1 coarsely chopped yellow onion, coarsely chopped stalks from 1 fennel bulb, 1 coarsely chopped celery stalk, and 2 sprigs fresh rosemary. Simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, and strain through a fine-mesh strainer to yield 4 cups pork stock.\nThis recipe has been tested with both leftover roast picnic shoulder and pork butt, and while both cuts work well, we prefer the tenderness and extra fattiness of pork butt.\nThis article explains the differences between pork butt and picnic shoulder in more detail\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe pasta is best enjoyed immediately, but the rag\u00f9 can be made through step 2 and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat gently in a large skillet with additional stock as needed, and then proceed with steps 3 and 4 of the recipe.\nRead More\nRoast a Pork Shoulder and Feast For Days\nRoasted Pork\nItalian\nPastas\nPork Shoulder\nPasta Mains"
