Stir in oil and season well with salt and pepper. Use right away or refrigerate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nChimichurri can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Many people say you can keep it longer than that, and indeed the vinegar in the sauce does have a preservative effect, but garlic-and-oil infusions can run the risk of botulism, and since this recipe has not been formulated to guarantee a low enough pH, we are being conservative in our storage recommendation.\nRead More\nItalian Salsa Verde With Parsley and Capers Recipe\nAji Amarillo (Green Peruvian Dipping Sauce) Recipe\nZhug (Yemenite Hot Sauce With Cilantro and Parsley) Recipe\nMint Mojo (Puerto Rican-style Garlic Sauce with Mint) Recipe\nCondiments & Sauces\nSouth American\nParsley"
