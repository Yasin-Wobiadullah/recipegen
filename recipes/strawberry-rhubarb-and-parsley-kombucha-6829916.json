Off heat, stir in parsley and let steep until tea registers roughly 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C), about 20 minutes. Stir in remaining 8 cups (1920ml) water and let cool until tea registers 85 to 90\u00b0F (30 to 32\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nSet a fine-mesh strainer over a one-gallon glass jar that has been run through a dishwasher cycle or sanitized with a product like Star San. Strain parsley tea through it; discard parsley. Stir in starter tea until well distributed, about 15 seconds. Gently place SCOBY on top (you should have at least 2 inches of headspace in the jar after adding the SCOBY). The SCOBY may float or sink to bottom of jar; either is normal.\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nCover jar with a double layer of coffee filters and secure with a rubber band. Store in a dark area between 70 and 80\u00b0F (21 to 27\u00b0C) and let ferment until kombucha tastes sour and small bubbles rise to surface, and a new layer of SCOBY has formed at surface, about 7 days and up to 4 weeks (pH should register roughly 2.9 on a pH meter or pH strips).\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nFor the Secondary Fermentation:\nIn a large non-reactive pot, combine rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, and water and bring to boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rhubarb is broken down and strawberries have no color, 15 to 20 minutes. Let mixture cool to room temperature, about 1 hour 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nStrain syrup through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl, gently pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Let mixture rest until sediment settles at bottom, about 20 minutes. Carefully pour syrup into a clean container, making sure to leave sediment behind, then set aside; you should have about 2 cups (473ml).\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nThoroughly wash and dry five 16-ounce (1-pint) twist-cap or flip-top glass bottles. Using clean hands, remove SCOBY from kombucha and place on plate. Then, using a funnel, fill each bottle with 1/3 cup (79ml) strawberry-rhubarb syrup. Stir kombucha with a wooden spoon, making sure sediment is evenly dispersed, then fill each bottle with kombucha, making sure to leave 1 to 1 1/2 inches of headspace in each bottle (you should have about 2 cups of extra kombucha that won't fit in the 5 bottles; this kombucha can be used as starter for your next batch). Seal bottles and store in a dark area between 70 and 80\u00b0F (21-27\u00b0C) until beverage reaches desired level of carbonation, 3 days to 2 weeks. Check one bottle periodically to monitor carbonation: it is ready when you see small bubbles rising fairly rapidly to the top, even when capped; if using twist caps, the cap will pop up slightly when a good level of carbonation is reaches; if using flip-top bottles, you may need to open one bottle to check the carbonation, resealing if there isn't enough fizz. When kombucha has reached desired level of carbonation, move bottles to refrigerator and store for up to 8 weeks.\nSerious Eats / Tim Chin\nTo Continue Brewing Future Batches of Kombucha:\nRepeat Steps 1 to 4, using the leftover kombucha as starter along with reserved SCOBY and new batches of the strawberry-rhubarb syrup.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge fine-mesh strainer, one-gallon glass jar, funnel, large coffee filters, five 16-ounce (1-pint) twist-cap bottles or flip-top bottles; dishwasher or a sanitizer like Star San (for cleaning vessels); pH meter or pH strips\nNotes\nStarter tea may be obtained commercially; we recommend an original, unflavored black or green tea kombucha for this. For best results, use jasmine or green tea kombucha from a previous batch, or parsley kombucha from a previous batch if you've made this recipe before.\nThe best source of a SCOBY is a friend or acquaintance who regularly brews kombucha. You can also buy them commercially, but note that SCOBY's that are sold dry or unsubmerged in starter liquid tend to perform weakly in comparison to those sold fresh and packaged in starter tea.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nThe strawberry-rhubarb syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. The finished bottled kombucha can be refrigerated for up to 8 weeks.\nTeas\nThe Latest\nFermentation",
