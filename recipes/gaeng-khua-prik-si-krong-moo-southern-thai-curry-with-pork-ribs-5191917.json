  "full_text": "Gaeng Khua Prik Si Krong Moo (Southern Thai Curry with Pork Ribs)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n2 hrs\nTotal\n2 hrs\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 whole rack\nSt. Louis-cut pork ribs\n(about 2 pounds;\n900\ng\n), cut in half lengthwise (see notes)\n3\ntablespoons\n(45ml)\nvegetable oil\n4 ounces (1/2 cup;\n115\ng\n)\nSouthern Thai curry paste\n3 tablespoons (\n45\nml\n)\nfish sauce\n1 tablespoon (\n10\ng\n) coarsely\nground black pepper\n1 tablespoon (\n15\ng\n)\nsugar\n10\nfresh or frozen\nmakrut lime leaves\n(see notes)\nKosher salt\nCooked\njasmine rice\n, for serving\nDirections\nPat ribs dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, divide into single-rib pieces by cutting through meat between rib bones. Set aside.\nVicky Wasik\nIn a small or medium Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add curry paste, stir vigorously with a rubber spatula to incorporate with oil, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd pork ribs and 1 tablespoon (15ml) water to help loosen paste and stir to evenly coat ribs with curry paste mixture. Cook, stirring and turning ribs frequently, until meat turns pale grey and no longer looks raw on surface but is not browned, 3 to 5 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd fish sauce, black pepper, sugar, and 6 cups (1.5L) water. Stir to combine, bring to a rapid simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is barely tender and liquid is reduced and thickened, about 1 hour.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd makrut lime leaves and more water as needed to keep ribs barely submerged (about 1 1/2 cups; 375ml), and continue to cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a steady simmer, until pork is completely tender and the curry is reduced to a thick, saucy consistency and fat just begins to separate around the edges of the pot, about 30 minutes longer.\nVicky Wasik\nRemove from heat, season with salt to taste, and transfer curry to a large serving bowl or divide between individual serving bowls. Serve with cooked jasmine rice.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nWhen purchasing ribs, ask butcher to cut rack in half lengthwise (through the bones).\nMakrut lime leaves can be found at Southeast Asian and South Asian markets. If you\u2019re lucky you will find them fresh, but it is more common to find them frozen (note that they are often sold under a different name that we avoid using, as\nit is a derogatory term in some contexts\n).\nThai\nPork\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork Mains\nThe Latest"
