Transfer to a bowl, making sure to get all of the excess oil. Add oregano to chorizo and toss to combine. Wipe out skillet and set aside.\nCombine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar, 1 egg, vegetable oil, buttermilk, and half of chorizo mixture in a large bowl and whisk together until it forms a batter. There should be no streaks of dry flour, but plenty of lumps are okay.\nReturn skillet to medium-low heat, add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add 2 halloumi slices (these will become the center of two pancakes). Cook until lightly browned on first side, about 1 minute. Flip halloumi and scatter a teaspoon of crisp chorizo on either side of each piece of halloumi.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nLadle a few ounces of batter on top of halloumi and chorizo, completely covering it. Cook pancake without moving until well-browned and crisp on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until browned on second side, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a rack and set in a warm oven while you cook the remaining pancakes.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nRepeat Steps 3 and 4 to cook remaining pancakes.\nHeat another tablespoon of oil in the skillet and place over medium-high heat. Break remaining 4 eggs into the skillet and cook until crisp on the bottom but yolks are still runny, about 1 1/2 minutes.\nServe pancakes immediately, topped with a fried egg and drizzled with remaining chorizo and chorizo oil.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge nonstick skillet or\ncast iron skillet\n, whisk\nNotes\nUse dry-style raw Spanish chorizo, not Mexican-style raw chorizo or cooked chorizo. If you can't find it locally, you can order it online from Amazon. I recommend Palacio brand.\nPancakes\nFried Eggs\nSausages"
