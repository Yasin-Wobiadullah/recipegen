Add chicken, 1/4 cup hot sauce, and butter, and mix gently with fingers until just combined (don't overmix). Chill until slightly firm, about 30 minutes. Shape into four patties that are just wider than the buns.\nStir blue cheese into mayonnaise; chill until ready to serve. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in skillet (see note) over medium heat until shimmering. Add patties and cook until cooked through (155\u00b0F or 68\u00b0C), about 3 to 4 minutes per side, basting the second side with the remaining hot sauce as they cook. Transfer to a plate and wipe out skillet with paper towel.\nReturn skillet to heat and toast the flat sides of the buns in the empty pan. Serve the burgers with the blue cheese mayo, sprinkle with the chopped celery, and lettuce and tomato if desired.\nNotes\nFlavor and juiciness was a priority with these burgers, so I added butter to the mix. To make the breadcrumbs, I pulsed a slice of white bread. I tested these burgers on a grill, grill pan, and flat skillet; ultimately, I found that a flat skillet or cast iron pan is the best tool to accommodate the soft texture of the raw burger patties.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpicy Buffalo Chicken Burgers\nBurgers\nAmerican\nStovetop Chicken\nBlue Cheese\nGame Day",
