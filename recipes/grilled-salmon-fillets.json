  "full_text": "Grilled Salmon Fillets\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n35 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\ncenter-cut skin-on salmon fillets\n, about\n6 to 8\nounces\n(\n170 to 225\ng\n)\nVegetable\n,\ncanola\n, or other\nneutral oil\n, for oiling the steaks\nKosher salt\nFreshly\nground black pepper\n(optional; see note)\nDirections\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil\ngrilling grate.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nDry salmon fillets well with paper towels and lightly brush them all over with oil.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nJust before cooking, season salmon all over with salt and, if desired, pepper. Then set skin-side down over hot side of grill. Cook salmon until skin is browned and crispy and releases from the grill easily, about 4 minutes. If the fish sticks, try to gently lift it from below using a thin metal spatula or the tines of a carving fork inserted down between the grill grates.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nGently flip the fish and cook on the flesh side just long enough to reach your desired internal temperature, 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) in the very center for rare, 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) for medium-rare, or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium. If at any point the fish threatens to burn before reaching its final internal temperature, move it to the cooler side of the grill to finish cooking. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n;\ncharcoal chimney starter\n;\ngrill brush\n;\ngrilling spatula\nor\nfish spatula\n;\nculinary tweezers\n(optional);\ninstant-read thermometer\n;\npepper mill\n(optional)\nNotes\nBlack pepper is a spice and adds a specific flavor to the food you cook; salt, on the other hand, is an essential seasoning, necessary for food to taste its best. While we always use salt, we use black pepper only when we desire its specific flavor and aroma.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nGrilled salmon is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nGrilled Salmon Steak Medallions Recipe\nHow to Get Started Grilling\nA Guide to Pepper: The World's Most Popular Spice\nTaste Test: A Guide to Black Pepper\nSeafood Mains\nGrilled Fish\nSalmon\nEaster",
