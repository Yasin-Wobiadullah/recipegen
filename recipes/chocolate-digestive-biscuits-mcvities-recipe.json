Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cubed butter in the bowl of a food processor. Process until butter virtually disappears into a fine, floury meal. Add buttermilk and pulse to form a damp and crumbly dough. Turn onto an unfloured surface and knead into a ball.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRoll and Bake the Biscuits:\nOn a generously floured surface, roll dough until just shy of 1/4 inch (4.7mm), using as much flour as needed along the way to prevent sticking. Dust away excess flour with a pastry brush and decorate with a docking tool if you like. Cut into 2 3/4\u2013inch rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Gather up scraps, knead, roll, and cut as before.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake until firm to the touch and light brown all over, about 18 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pan and continue with next step, or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTemper the Chocolate:\nTemper chocolate according to one of the methods described\nhere\n.\nCoat the Biscuits:\nWorking with just 2 or 3 biscuits at a time, dollop a generous 1/2 tablespoon, or just over 1/4 ounce, chocolate over each. Spread into an even layer over biscuit and, as chocolate starts to thicken, bounce the tines of a fork across the surface to create a wavy pattern. Repeat with remaining biscuits and chocolate. (Before it hardens, store excess chocolate according to the directions\nhere\n.) Serve biscuits immediately, preferably with hot tea, and transfer to an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor fitted with a metal blade, half sheet pan, rolling pin, pastry brush, docking tool (optional), 2 3/4\u2013inch round cutter or wine glass\nNotes\nIf you want the most authentic dark chocolate flavor, I've found that Chocolove 70% has a bittersweet intensity almost exactly like the chocolate in the original McVities. For milk chocolate, the caramel notes in Valrhona's Caramelia make it a perfect match.\nRead More\nVegan Chocolate-Covered Digestive Biscuits\nCookies\nBritish\nChocolate\nEaster Desserts"
