Season well with salt. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low, cover, and allow sauce to cook, stirring occasionally, until all vegetables are completely tender, about 30 minutes. Remove lid for last 5 minutes of cooking.\nWhile sauce simmers, heat oil in a wok or Dutch oven until it registers 300\u00b0F on an instant read or deep-fry thermometer. Add plantains and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\nLine your cutting board with plastic wrap. Smash plantains under a plastic wrap-lined metal can or heavy skillet to roughly 1/8th to 1/4-inch thickness.\nHeat oil up to 350\u00b0F to 375\u00b0F and return plantains to pot.

Serve fried plantains topped with sauce and sprinkled with parsley.\nColombian"
