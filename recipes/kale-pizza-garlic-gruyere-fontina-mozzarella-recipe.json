Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.\nCombine kale and olive oil in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Toss, massaging with hands until every surface of the kale is coated in oil. Set aside while the pizza dough rests. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to top position under broiler and place a baking steel or pizza stone on top. Preheat oven to maximum heat setting.\nWhen ready to bake, transfer one ball of pizza dough to a bowl of flour and turn to coat. Transfer to a lightly floured wooden pizza peel and stretch or roll into a thin circle. Top with half of grated cheese and half of mozzarella torn into small chunks. Sprinkle half of garlic and half of pepper flakes over surface.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTurn broiler on to high and launch pizza onto baking steel. Bake, rotating occasionally, until cheese has melted and edges are barely starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from oven with a metal pizza peel, distribute half of kale evenly over surface, and return to oven. Bake, rotating occasionally, until kale is charred and crisp and edges of pizza are browned, about 2 minutes longer. Serve immediately, then repeat with remaining pizza.\nSpecial Equipment\nPizza peel,\nbaking steel\nor pizza stone\nRead More\nBasic New York-Style Pizza Dough Recipe\nThe Pizza Lab: On Flour Types, Foams, and Dough\n11 Essential Tips for Better Pizza\nPizza\nVegetarian Mains\nKale"
