Sprinkle yeast and sugar over the warmed milk mixture and let sit until frothy, about 3 minutes.\nSift salt with flour into a large bowl. Gently mix the yeast mixture with a fork, then pour over flour; mix with a wooden spoon until dough forms, then knead the dough lightly with your hands. Form the dough into a ball and place into an oiled bowl. Cover with a tea towel and let dough double in size, about 90 minutes.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Punch down the dough and divide it into 8 portions. Form these into ovals, and set them on the baking sheet, leaving as much room as possible between them. Cover with plastic wrap, making sure that the wrap is touching the dough to prevent a skin from forming. Let rise for an additional 15 minutes.\nRemove plastic wrap, then brush tops and sides of baps with remaining tablespoon milk, and sprinkle with flour. Bake until baps are puffed and golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool on a rack. Baps are best the day they are made but can be stored in a plastic bag or covered container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in a 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) oven for 5 minutes to refresh. Use baps for sandwiches.\nSpecial Equipment\nBaking sheet\nSandwiches\nBritish\nSausages\nBreakfast Sandwich",
