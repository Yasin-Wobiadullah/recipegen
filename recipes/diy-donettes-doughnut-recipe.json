When well combined, sift in flour and stir to form a soft dough, no more than 30 seconds. Turn onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until easy to handle. Dusting with as much flour as needed, roll to 3/8 inch thick. Brush off excess flour with a damp pastry brush and cut into 1 3/4\u2013inch rounds. Arrange upside down on a paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet, then brush away excess flour. Gather scraps, briefly knead, and repeat as before.\nForming the Hole:\nWith a damp fingertip, press an indentation into the center of each doughnut, then flip the doughnuts and repeat. Take one doughnut in both hands and use a finger to gently pull open a hole in the center. (The paper-thin centers will give way at the slightest touch.) Smooth the ragged edges if you like and repeat with the remaining doughnuts.\nPreparing the Oil:\nMelt refined coconut oil in a microwave, then pour into a roughly 8- to 10-inch stainless steel pot to a depth of at least 2 inches. (This gives cake doughnuts room to sink, allowing them to fry more quickly and absorb less oil.) Clip on digital thermometer and warm to 365\u00b0F over medium heat. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with 3 layers of paper towels and have the powdered sugar ready in a fine-mesh sieve.\nFrying the Doughnuts:\nWhen oil reaches 365\u00b0F, practice maintaining that temperature for a few minutes before beginning to fry. Once you're comfortable with the controls, slip a test doughnut into the hot oil and fry until pale gold, turning frequently with tongs to ensure even color, about 60 seconds. Transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet, then sprinkle generously with powdered sugar. Taste to see how you like the results, adding or subtracting a few seconds if needed to perfect subsequent batches. Fry remaining doughnuts, up to 6 or 7 at a time, and enjoy warm with powdered sugar. Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 36 hours at room temperature (these are best dunked in milk or coffee).\nSpecial equipment\n1 3/4\u2013inch round cutter, 8- to 10-inch stainless steel pot,\ndigital thermometer with clip-on attachment\n,\nmetal tongs\n,\nfine-mesh sieve\nNotes\nUpdate:\nAvoid Greek yogurt thickened with gum, gelatin, or pectin. Look for brands that contain only milk and active cultures; this recipe was tested with both Fage and Chobani. Small jars of refined coconut oil can be fairly pricey in supermarkets, but expect to pay less than $15 for a 54-ounce container when shopping at warehouse clubs, like Sam's or Costco.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBraveTart: Conquering DIY Donettes\nDoughnuts\nFrying\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
