  "full_text": "Lemon Meringue Icebox Cake\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n6 mins\nChilling Time\n6 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n6 hrs 46 mins\nServes\n8\nMakes\n1 9- by 4-inch\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the Cake:\n1 1/2\ncup\ns (360ml)\nheavy cream\n1\ntablespoon\n(15g) superfine or\ngranulated sugar\n1/4\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\n2\ncup\ns\nlemon curd\n(18 1/2 ounces; 525g),\nhomemade\nor store-bought\n128\ng\nRitz crackers\n(4 1/2 ounces; about 32 Ritz crackers)\nFor the Italian Meringue:\n4 large\negg whites\n(about\n5\nounces\n; 140g), at room temperature\n200\ng\ngranulated sugar\n(7 ounces; 1 cup)\n1/2\ncup\n(120ml)\nwater\nDirections\nLine a 9- by 4-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine heavy cream, sugar, and salt. Whip on medium-high speed until medium-stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. (Alternatively, combine cream, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a hand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat on medium speed until medium stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a flexible or offset spatula, spread about 1/2 cup (50g) whipped cream on the bottom. Cover surface with 8 Ritz crackers and gently press into whipped cream. Spoon 1/2 cup (about 100g) lemon curd over crackers. Repeat three more times, until you have four layers. Top with 8 crackers and a thin layer of whipped cream. Press plastic wrap against surface of whipped cream and refrigerate until crackers have softened, about 6 hours or up to 24 hours.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nLine a 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with foil. Remove plastic from top of cake and invert icebox cake onto lined baking sheet, gently peel away plastic, and transfer to freezer until firm enough to slice, about 1 hour or up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, prepare the Italian meringue:\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, begin whisking egg whites on low speed. In a small saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until sugar syrup registers 240\u00baF (115\u00baC) on an instant-read or candy thermometer, about 4 to 6 minutes. (Remove from heat immediately once sugar syrup reaches temperature.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIncrease mixer speed to medium and mix until soft peaks form. With the mixer running on medium speed, carefully and slowly drizzle hot sugar syrup into the side of the bowl. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form and meringue is no longer hot, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nRemove cake from freezer. Using a flexible or offset spatula, frost cake with Italian meringue. Using a butane blowtorch, torch meringue 1- to 2- inches away from the surface of the meringue until evenly browned. Hold both ends of the foil and gently lift cake to transfer to a cutting board. Gently wiggle a chef\u2019s knife or long offset spatula under the cake to loosen it from the foil and gently pull foil to remove.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a hot knife, slice cake into 8 pieces and serve. (For cleaner cuts, run knife under warm water and carefully dry knife with a clean kitchen towel before portioning each slice.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 4-inch loaf pan, stand mixer or hand mixer, flexible or offset spatula, 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet, instant-read or candy thermometer, butane blowtorch\nNotes\nIf you don\u2019t feel like making Italian meringue, you can substitute with store-bought marshmallow fluff and torch it for a similar result.\nIf you don\u2019t own a blowtorch, you can toast the meringue in the oven. However, it is crucial that the icebox cake is fully frozen before you frost it with meringue, otherwise the mousse and cream will melt. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 500\u00baF (260\u00baC). After coating the cake with meringue, transfer rimmed baking sheet with icebox cake to oven and bake until meringue is golden brown, about 5 minutes.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nUnfrosted, the icebox can be made up to 1 week in advance and frozen before frosting, slicing, and serving. Proceed with step 10 when ready to serve.\nSliced icebox cake can be frozen on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment and tightly wrapped with plastic for up to 5 days.\nLemon\nThe Latest\nSummer Desserts\nDesserts\nIcebox Cake",
