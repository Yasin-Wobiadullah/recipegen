Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean\nand\noil\nthe grilling grate.\nSpread an even layer of sugar on a small plate and dip the cut side of each peach half into it to coat lightly; top up sugar if needed. Set peaches, sugar side down, near but not directly over the coals (about medium to medium-high heat) and cook until the sugar coating has turned a deep caramel brown in spots, about 3 minutes; take care to make sure they don\u2019t burn. Flip the peaches and move them to the cooler side of the grill. Cook until peaches are softened throughout but still hold their shape, 5 to 10 minutes. Keep warm. (You can move the peaches closer to and farther from the fire as needed to ensure they cook through and then remain warm without overcooking.)\nSet an oven-proof 10-inch stainless steel skillet over the hot side of the grill and add the 1 cup sugar to it. Shake to spread sugar in an even layer, then cook until the sugar has melted and formed an amber caramel, about 10 minutes (timing can vary heavily depending on the grill's heat).\nCarefully and slowly add the vinegar; the liquid will splatter and bubble a bit. Try not to inhale the vapor from the boiling vinegar; it can be very potent. Cook, swirling gently from time to time, until the vinegar and caramel come together to form a uniform sauce; it's best not to stir during this time, as the caramel can clump onto the stirring utensil. Continue cooking until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Whisk in 1 piece of butter at a time, whisking constantly until each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Season with salt. Remove the caramel from the grill and let cool to room temperature.\nSet poundcake slices over medium heat zone of the grill and cook until toasted, about 1 minute. Flip and repeat on other side. Be careful as the cake can burn quickly.\nTo assemble, place pound cake on plates. Top with grilled peach halves, then pour a generous amount of caramel over the peaches. Top with a dollop of whipped cream and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill,\n10-inch oven-safe stainless-steel skillet\n,\nwhisk\nPeach\nThe Latest\nSummer Desserts\nGrilling",
