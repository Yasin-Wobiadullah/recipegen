Return pan to medium heat and cook until alcohol burns off, about 2-3 minutes.\nStir in gochujang and nori.

Stir sesame oil into gochujang ghee and refrigerate in a covered container until ready to use, up to 2 weeks.\nNotes\nGochujang and teriyaki-flavored nori sheets can be found at Asian markets and many specialty food stores.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nIdeas in Food vs. Linguine alle Vongole: Part 1\nCondiments & Sauces\nSesame & Tahini",
