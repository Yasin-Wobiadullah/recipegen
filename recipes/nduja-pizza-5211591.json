  "full_text": "Outdoor Pizza Oven 'Nduja Pizza\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nProof\n60 mins\nTotal\n95 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nrecipe\nfor\noutdoor pizza oven pizza dough\n1\n(\n28-ounce\n;\n795 g\n)\ncan whole peeled tomatoes\n, drained, juices reserved\n24\nfresh basil leaves\n2\nounces\n(\n60\ng\n) finely grated\nParmesan cheese\n12\nounces\n(\n340\ng\n)\nfresh mozzarella\n, torn into 3/4-inch pieces and patted dry\n2\nounces\n(\n1/4\ncup\n;\n60\ng\n)\n'nduja\n(see note)\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n, for drizzling\n2\ntablespoons\nchopped\nfresh parsley leaves\n, for garnish (optional)\nDirections\nRemove dough from refrigerator and allow to rest in proofing containers, covered, at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before baking. Dough temperature should reach 60\u02daF (15.5\u00b0C) before stretching and baking; exact timing will depend upon ambient temperature.\nMelissa Rivard\nUsing a countertop or immersion blender, process tomatoes until a coarse but evenly blended sauce forms, about 10 seconds. Transfer to a 2-cup liquid measuring cup; if needed, add reserved tomato liquid to yield 2 cups (475ml) sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.\nMelissa Rivard\nPreheat pizza oven to 800\u00b0F (425\u00b0C). When ready to bake, coat one dough ball generously on both sides with flour and place on well-floured surface, seam side down. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer 1-inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough into a 10- or 12-inch circle (final dimension depends upon the size of your oven) about 1/4-inch thick by draping over knuckles and gently stretching. Transfer to floured wooden or perforated metal pizza peel.\nMelissa Rivard\nWorking quickly, scatter 6 basil leaves over pizza, leaving outer 1/2-inch rim untopped. Spread an even layer of tomato sauce over pizza. Sprinkle with Parmesan, followed by mozzarella. Dollop \u2018nduja in 2 teaspoon amounts over sauce. Drizzle with olive oil.\nMelissa Rivard\nTransfer pizza to oven and bake, rotating pie regularly with a metal peel for even cooking, until rim is lightly charred and bottom is crisp, 90 to 180 seconds total. Retrieve pizza with a metal peel and transfer to a cutting board. Sprinkle with parsley (if using), slice, and serve immediately.\nMelissa Rivard\nRepeat steps 5 through 7 for remaining pizzas.\nSpecial Equipment\nHigh-temperature outdoor pizza oven\n,\nimmersion blender\n,\nwooden or perforated metal pizza peel\n, metal pizza peel.\nNotes\n'Nduja is a spicy spreadable pork salume that originates from the southern Italian region of Calabria. In the US, it can be purchased at specialty shops that carry salumi/charcuterie, Italian markets, or online from producers like\nTempesta Artisan Salumi\n. Look for 'nduja made with just four ingredients: pork, Calabrian chilies, salt, and lactic acid.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTomato sauce can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\nPizza\nItalian\nPork\nThe Latest",
