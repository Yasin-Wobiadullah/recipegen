With processor running, slowly pour water through feed tube and process until a smooth, emulsified sauce forms, about 10 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nAdd the herbs, followed by the drained chickpeas and chopped cucumbers to prepared sauce in food processor. Pulse until well combined and broken down but still chunky, 5 to 7 pulses. Season to taste with salt, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nFor Making Sandwiches:\nAdd about 1/2 cup chickpea salad to bread or stuff into pita pocket. Top with tomatoes, lettuce, pickled red onions or other pickled vegetables, and/or a drizzle of zhug, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nNotes\nTahini tends to separate as it sits, with the solids sticking to the bottom of the container and the oil floating to the top. Make sure to scrape, stir, and shake well before measuring to ensure a good mix of both components.\nIf you don\u2019t have cucumbers, celery is a good substitute in this salad.\nTo make this salad vegan, use vegan mayonnaise. For a homemade version, save the liquid from the chickpeas in this recipe to make our\neasy vegan mayonnaise\nwith the aquafaba.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis salad can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nMains\nChickpeas\nSandwiches"
