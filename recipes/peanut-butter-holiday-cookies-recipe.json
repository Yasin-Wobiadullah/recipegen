Add the egg and continue mixing. Add the dry ingredients, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until the dough is firm. If the dough is too dry, add water by the tablespoon (but no more than 1/4 cup) until it is moist and easier to work with. Fold in the chocolate and the peanuts.\nRefrigerate the dough for 1 hour. When chilled, use a scoop, spoon, or your hands to form 1 inch wide balls of dough. Arrange on a cookie sheet at least 1 inch apart. Flatten each ball with your palm or the back of a spoon. Bake for 12 minutes or until golden. Allow to cool completely before removing from baking sheet. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.\nCookies\nBaking\nPeanut Butter",
