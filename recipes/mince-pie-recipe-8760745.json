Drizzle brandy over fruit and, using a flexible spatula, stir until evenly distributed. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours, stirring 2 to 3 times during this period.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen fruit has chilled for 24 hours, sterilize 2 heat-safe pint jars and lids: Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Wash jars with soap and hot water. Place jars, open mouth facing downwards, on a prepared baking sheet and heat at 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place rings and lids in a pan of water on the stovetop and boil for 10 minutes. (See notes.) Remove jars from oven and let cool, about 15 minutes; using tongs, remove rings and lids from pan of water and set them on wire rack with jars to cool.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen jars and lids are cool enough to handle, spoon mincemeat into jars and cover tightly with lids. Refrigerate until fruit is well-hydrated, at least 2 weeks or up to 3 months.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Pastry:\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk flour and confectioners\u2019 sugar to combine. Add the butter and, using your fingertips, rub it into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs, 3 to 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMake a well in the center of the flour mixture about 2 to 3 inches wide. Pour beaten egg and water into the well and, using a fork, gradually incorporate flour into the egg until a dry, crumbly dough forms, about 1 minute. Use your hands to finish bringing the dough together, gently squeezing about 8 to 10 times, just until it holds together in a ball. Dough will feel slightly crumbly. Flatten dough into an 8-inch disc. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until just firm enough to roll, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing nonstick spray, generously grease a 12-cup mince pie or muffin tin. (See notes). Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nOn a lightly floured countertop, use a rolling pin to roll the dough to 1/8-inch (3.2mm) thickness. Using a 3 1/2-inch round cutter or scalloped round cutter, cut 12 circles of dough. If necessary, re-roll scraps and cut remaining circles. Using your fingertips, gently press 1 dough circle into the bottom and sides of each cavity of the tin; do not trim sides. Re-roll scraps to about 3/16-inch (5mm) thickness. Using a 2 3/4-inch star, snowflake, or other decorative cutter, cut 12 shapes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a spoon, stir mincemeat thoroughly. Using a teaspoon, fill each pastry shell with about 1 1/4 ounces or 35g (3 to 4 heaping teaspoons) mincemeat, pressing down gently with the back of the spoon to evenly distribute the filling. With a pastry brush, brush the thin scalloped edge with egg yolk. Place a star or other decorative piece of dough on top of each pie and use your fingertips to gently press it into place. Brush the top of each decorative piece of dough with a thin layer of egg yolk.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nRefrigerate until pastry is firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSprinkle tops of pies generously with Demerara sugar. Bake until filling is bubbly and pastry is deep golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. (See notes.) Cool pies in pan for 10 minutes. Using a small offset spatula, gently remove tarts from the pan and transfer to a wire rack. Cool until warm but no longer piping hot, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n12-cup muffin or mince pie pan, 2 heat-safe glass pint jars and lids, 3 1/2-inch scalloped round cutter, 2 3/4-inch star or other decorative cutter, Microplane, rolling pin, pastry brush\nVariations\nFeel free to customize your filling ingredients. You can experiment with other citrus zests, such as grapefruit or lime. You can use any combination of raisins, sultanas (golden raisins), or currants, or replace a portion with other dried fruit like cranberries, apricots, dates, or candied ginger. For added crunch, stir in 35g (1/4 cup) of chopped pecans or chopped blanched almonds. Instead of brandy, try dark or spiced rum. You can also sweeten the mincemeat with light brown, muscovado, or Demerara (Turbinado) sugar.\nNotes\nSuet can be purchased online and at specialty grocery stores. If you can\u2019t find suet, you can substitute shortening. To use shortening in place of suet: Place box grater in fridge to chill and refrigerate shortening until firm, then grate on the coarse side of chilled box grater.\nIf you don't have mixed spice:\nSubstitute 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, and a pinch of ground cloves.\nTo sterilize the jars:\nWash jars with soap and hot water. Place jars, open mouth facing upward, on a baking tray and heat at 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place rings and lids in a pan of water on the stovetop and boil for 10 minutes. Alternatively, you can sterilize the jars in the dishwasher if your dishwasher has a \"sterilize\" setting.\nPastry recipe can be doubled.\nIf using a muffin tin, use a 4 1/2-inch round cutter or scalloped round cutter to punch out dough circles and fill each pie with about 5 tablespoons filling.\nWhen filling the pies:\nThe mincemeat should be roughly level with the edges of the pastry. Do not overfill the cavities or the mince will bubble over and stick to the pan, making it difficult to remove the pies. Depending on the pan you\u2019ve chosen, you might have a small amount of mincemeat left over. If using freshly made (not aged) mincemeat, it will still contain a lot of watery liquid. Do not add all of the liquid when filling the pies\u2014it can make the pastry mushy, or leak as the pies bake.\nMince pies baked in a dark metal pan will bake faster than those baked in a light-colored pan.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nHomemade mincemeat can be aged in sterilized jars in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.\nPastry dough can be flattened into a disc, wrapped in plastic wrap, and refrigerated for up to 48 hours. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes, or until soft enough to roll.\nStore leftover mince pies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. Reheat in the microwave, rewarm in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes, or enjoy at room temperature.\nTo freeze:\nWrap individual mince pies in foil, or layer between sheets of parchment and freeze in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature.\nThe Latest\nPies\nFruit\nDesserts\nBritish",
