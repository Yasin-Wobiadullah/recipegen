Do not push cranberry mixture through strainer (fibers will get pushed through), but shake it back and forth. Stir in orange zest and maraschino, then chill for several hours until very cold.\nChurn goat cheese ice cream according to manufacturer's instructions.

Quickly transfer to a container to freeze for two to three hours before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nice cream maker, blender\nIce Cream\nGoat Cheese\nCranberry"
