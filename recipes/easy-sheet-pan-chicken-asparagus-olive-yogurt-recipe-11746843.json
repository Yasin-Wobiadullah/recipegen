On a rimmed half-sheet pan, season chicken thighs all over with salt and lightly drizzle with olive oil. Space thighs out, skin-side up, so that there is plenty of space between them and they are similarly distant from sheet pan's edges. Roast until thighs are just cooked through and skin is beginning to turn golden and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nPush chicken to center of sheet pan and arrange asparagus and scallions all around. (You can cut the asparagus and scallions into bite-size pieces before arranging them on the pan, or follow the directions in the next step for cutting them after they are cooked\u2014either method works well.) Drizzle asparagus and scallions all over with olive oil and season lightly with salt. Roast until asparagus is very tender and lightly browned in spots, 10 to 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir together yogurt and olive spread, and season with salt to taste. When asparagus and chicken are done, use kitchen shears to snip asparagus and scallions into shorter lengths (or transfer to a work surface and cut into smaller pieces on the bias). Let cool slightly.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine fennel with 3 tablespoons (45 g) accumulated roasting juices and fat from the sheet pan along with the 1 tablespoon olive oil and the lemon juice. Toss to coat and season to taste with salt. Add reserved fennel fronds, torn mint, asparagus, and scallions and toss gently to combine.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nOn serving plates or a serving platter, spread yogurt sauce in a generous even layer. Arrange roasted chicken thighs on top, and mound the salad alongside. Spoon additional sheet-pan juices all over and around. Serve.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nMany different olive spreads can work. A basic pur\u00e9ed olive mixture will be great, as will an olive tapenade. Feel free to use whatever is convenient and available to you.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nChicken\nChicken Mains\nRecipes By Ingredients",
