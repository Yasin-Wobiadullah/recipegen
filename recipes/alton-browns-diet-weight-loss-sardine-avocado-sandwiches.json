  "full_text": "Alton Brown's Sardine-Avocado Sandwiches Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n5 mins\nTotal\n15 mins\nServes\n4 open-faced sandwiches\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\n(3.75-ounce) tins\nsardines in olive oil\n(mine were in tomato sauce; that works too)\n2\ntablespoons\nfinely\nchopped parsley\n1\ntablespoon\nvinegar\n(he suggests\nsherry vinegar\n; I used\napple cider vinegar\n)\nZest\nfrom\n1\nlemon\n, and the leftover (naked) lemon cut into 4 wedges\nFreshly ground black pepper\n4\nslices\ngood\nbread\n(I used\nwheat\n, he did\nsourdough\n)\n1\nripe avocado\nSea salt\nDirections\nDrain the oil from 1 tin of sardines into a small bowl and set aside.\nDrain the oil from the second tin into another small bowl and mix it with 1 tablespoon of parsley, vinegar, lemon zest, and black pepper. Add the sardines and stir. Let sit for a bit so the flavors marry.\nToast your bread in a normal toaster or, if you want to be all Alton-style fancy, heat the oven to the broiler setting on high and place oiled-swiped bread (using the remaining sardine oil) on the rack. Only keep them in there for 2 to 3 minutes, otherwise they will go from golden brown and crisp to charred and sad.\nHalve the avocado and remove the pit. Smoosh the flesh in each half with a fork. Spread this green goodness evenly onto the toasted bread, then top with a nice scoop of the sardine mixture.\nPour any remaining sardine oil dressing on top and garnish with the remaining parsley. Season with sea salt and a nice big squeeze from the lemon wedges.\nRead More\nCanned Sardine Banh Mi\nA Guide to Canned Fish and Seafood from Spain and Portugal\nTreat Your Shelf: Pricey Pantry Ingredients We Think Are Worth It\nSandwiches\nCanned Fish\nSardines\nAvocado\nToast",
