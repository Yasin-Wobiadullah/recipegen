Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until batter has roughly doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nHeat griddle on medium heat (see note). Spray the inside of eight 3 1/2-inch English muffin rings or round ring molds with non-stick cooking spray and place on griddle. Without stirring the batter, use a 1/3 measuring cup to evenly portion it into the rings. Cover rings with a baking sheet, reduce heat to low, and cook undisturbed for 5 minutes.\nRemove baking sheet. Using tongs to hold rings in place, slide a spatula underneath muffins and flip over to cook other side. Cover again, and cook 5 minutes longer.\nRemove baking sheet. Using tongs, remove rings from muffins and set aside. Using a spatula, transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Split English muffins by hand or with a fork. If desired, toast before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nStovetop or\nelectric griddle\n; 3 1/2-inch ring molds, English muffin rings, or other round metal form\nNotes\nYou can use unfed/discarded starter that has been kept at room temperature or straight from the refrigerator. To read more about discarding, feeding, and maintaining a sourdough starter, please see our guide\nhere\n.\nIf you don\u2019t have an electric griddle, you can use a heavy-bottomed non-stick 10-inch skillet or a 10-inch cast iron pan. Using either option, you can make four muffins at a time.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nEnglish muffins are best served the same day. Store leftover muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.\nMuffins\nYeast Breads\nBreakfast & Brunch"
