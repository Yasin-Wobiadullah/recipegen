Slowly bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat and stir in the herbs. Cover and let sit for half an hour to forty five minutes.\nWhen the cream mixture tastes herby enough, whisk together the egg yolks and honey. Reheat the cream mixture again till just hot but not simmering. Pour in the cream mixture through a strainer, making sure none of the herbs remain in the liquid or the pot. Whisk everything to combine, then pour it all back into the pot.\nSlowly bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently to prevent curdling or sticking to the bottom of the pot. After a few minutes, when the custard starts to feel thick, dip in a spoon and run your finger along the back. When the custard holds the line you drew without dripping, it's done.\nYou can chill it and spin it in your ice cream machine, but custards' flavor and texture benefit greatly from an overnight rest. Freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.\nSpecial equipment\nIce cream maker\nIce Cream\nHeavy Cream\nHerbs"
