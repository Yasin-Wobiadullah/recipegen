Gently crush with a muddler, rolling pin, or pestle, breaking rice into uneven pieces ranging from cornmeal-sized grains to larger pieces that are cracked or shattered in half.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, melt butter until foamy. Add turmeric, ginger, and red chile and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add rice, lentils, and chicken stock. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Simmer porridge, uncovered, until rice and lentils are tender, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd potato and chicken thighs to porridge. Cook gently until potatoes are tender, chicken is cooked through, and porridge is thickened, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, prepare the cilantro chutney. In a small bowl, mix cilantro and green chiles with lime juice and mustard oil, then season with salt. Stir to combine.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRemove chicken from porridge and transfer to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, dice chicken into 1/2-inch pieces and return to porridge. Adjust seasoning to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and add water if porridge becomes too thick.\nRemove from heat and pour porridge into bowls. Garnish with cilantro chutney and crispy fried shallots to taste.\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle\n,\nmuddler\n, or\nrolling pin\n;\n4-quart saucepan\nRead More\nThe Truth About Mustard Oil: Behind the \"For External Use Only\" Label\nGround Pork and Corn Congee (Chinese Rice Porridge) Recipe\nDak Juk (Korean Chicken and Rice Porridge) Recipe\nBrown Rice Congee With Beef, Shiitake, and Garlic Chips Recipe\nMulti-Grain Congee (Chinese Rice Porridge) Recipe\nSouth Asian\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nLentils\nChicken Thighs\nWhite Rice"
