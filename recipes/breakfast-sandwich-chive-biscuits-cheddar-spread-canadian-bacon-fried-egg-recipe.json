Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nSift flour, cake flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, baking soda, and pepper twice.\nAdd chilled butter to bowl, and, using two knives, cut into dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in chives.\nAdd 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and stir with wooden spoon just till combined. If mixture looks dry, add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time until dough is cohesive.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead just until it comes together, no more than 6 times. Pat dough into a 1-inch thick circle. Use floured biscuit cutter to stamp out the biscuits\u2014don\u2019t twist\u2014and arrange them about 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheet.\nBake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer tray to cooling rack.\nFor the Cheddar Spread:\nMeanwhile, in medium bowl, use fork to combine cheddar, cream cheese, mayonnaise, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.

Cook bacon until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side, then transfer to plate and tent with foil.\nAdd remaining tablespoon butter to skillet. Crack eggs into skillet and season with salt and pepper.\nWhen egg whites begin to bubble and turn opaque, add water and cover pan with lid.\nCook eggs 3 to 4 minutes until egg whites are set and egg yolk has a shell-pink color. Continue cooking eggs if you prefer a set yolk.\nUsing a spatula, divide the six eggs and remove from heat.\nTo assemble:\nCut biscuits in half and spread both halves with cheddar spread. Top bottom halves with 2 slices Canadian bacon, then top with one egg and sandwich with second biscuit half. Serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n4-inch biscuit cutter, sifter, rimmed baking sheet, parchment paper, wooden stirring spoon, cooling rack, large nonstick skillet with lid, foil\nNotes\nI usually make twelve 2 1/2-inch biscuits with this recipe, but since these are breakfast sandwiches, I like to go a bit bigger with them. You may have a few leftover, but I'm sure there will be no complaints.\nThe recipe is easily halved.\nMy preferred Canadian bacon is Applegate brand.\nSandwiches\nBiscuits\nSavory\nFried Eggs\nChives"
