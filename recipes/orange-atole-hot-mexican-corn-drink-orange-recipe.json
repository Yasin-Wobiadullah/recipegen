  "full_text": "Orange Atole (Hot Mexican Corn Drink With Orange Zest) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n15 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\nmasa harina para tortillas\n3\ncups\nwater\n, plus more as needed, divided (see note)\n1\ncup\nmilk\n3\n(1-inch)\nstrips\norange zest\nfrom\n1\nlarge\norange\n2\nstar anise\npods\n(optional)\n3\ntablespoons\ndark brown sugar\n(see note)\nKosher salt\nFinely grated orange zest\n, for garnish\nDirections\nIn a large saucepan, add masa and set over medium heat. Immediately add water in a slow, thin stream while whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring to a simmer and whisk in milk, orange zest strips, star anise (if using), brown sugar, and a generous pinch of salt.\nReturn to a simmer and lower heat to low. Continue to simmer gently, whisking constantly, until drink is infused with the orange aroma, about 5 minutes. Discard orange zest strips and star anise pods. Thin with additional water, as needed, to create a thick-yet-drinkable hot beverage (the exact consistency is a matter of personal taste, see note), reheating as necessary. Taste, adding more sugar or salt if desired. Froth with a whisk or immersion blender, then ladle into mugs, garnish with grated orange zest and serve.\nNotes\nExactly how much water and sugar you add will determine the final consistency and sweetness of the drink. This recipe produces a fairly thick, rich drink that is mildly sweet. You can add more water and sugar if you want a thinner, sweeter version.\nSpecial Equipment\nMicroplane grater\nRead More\nChampurrado (Mexican Hot Chocolate and Corn Drink)\nPeanut Atole (Hot Mexican Corn Drink With Peanut Flavor)\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nWinter Drinks\nMexican",
