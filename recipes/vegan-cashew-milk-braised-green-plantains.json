Stand each trimmed plantain piece upright and slice off skin with a sharp chef's knife or utility knife. Cut each peeled section into 1/4-inch-thick planks. Drop prepared plantain pieces into a brine made of 1 teaspoon of salt per quart of water.\nIn a blender, combine cashews, scallions, cilantro, and 25 fluid ounces (750ml) water and blend until smooth. If desired, strain cashew milk through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any stray bits.\nIn a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, add vegetable oil, garlic, turmeric, and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add cumin and black pepper and cook until the spices bloom in the oil, about 1 minute.\nAdd cashew and herb pur\u00e9e to pot. Season with kosher salt to taste. Drain plantains and add to cashew sauce. Bring to a simmer, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook until plantains become tender, about 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to prevent cashew sauce from scorching. Finish braised plantains with sugar and lime juice. Serve with rice.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender, chef's knife,\nfine-mesh strainer\n(optional)\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHomemade Cashew Milk + Green Plantains = Creamy (Vegan) Deliciousness\nVegetarian Mains\nRecipes By Diet\nVegan Mains\nBraised & Stewed Vegetables\nPlantains"
