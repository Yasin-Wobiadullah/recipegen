Sweeten with additional maple syrup as needed and serve with fresh fruit, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nYour choice of dairy or dairy-free milk can be substituted for oat milk. I tested this with regular sweetened oat milk, but if you\u2019d like to cut down on the sugar, you can use unsweetened oat milk. To make gluten-free overnight oats, use gluten-free rolled oats.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe recipe can easily be doubled. Overnight oats can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nThe Latest\nVegan\nVegan Breakfast & Brunch\nOats"
