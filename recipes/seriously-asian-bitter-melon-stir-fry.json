Cut the melon crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices and set aside.\nFor the ground pork mixture:\nIn a small bowl, mix the ground pork with the rice wine, ginger, sugar, and salt. Set aside.\nFor the sauce:\nMix all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and set aside.\nHeat a wok over high heat. Add 3 tablespoons oil and heat until shimmering. Add the pork mixture and cook, tossing and stirring, until the pork is just cooked through. Scrape out onto a clean plate.\nReturn the wok to high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and heat until shimmering. Add the slices of bitter melon to the wok. Stir-fry over high heat until the melon is considerably softened but still a bit crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the sauce mixture and mix with the melon, then stir-fry 1 minute longer.\nTurn off the heat and add the cornstarch slurry to the wok. Stir around rapidly to prevent the cornstarch from clumping. Add a few tablespoons more water to the wok if needed to thin out the sauce. Return the wok to low heat and simmer the mixture for 20 seconds. Add the pork mixture back to the wok, stirring to combine. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nRead More\nPinakbet (Filipino Vegetable Stew)\nStir-Fried Luffa Gourds With Eggs\nStir-Fried Cucumbers With Spicy Ground Pork\nWok Skills 101: Stir-Frying Basics\nMelon\nChinese\nVegetable Stir-Fry\nPork\nVegetable Sides",
