  "full_text": "Fresh Summer Tomato Bruschetta Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n15 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2 pounds (\n680\ng\n) best-quality, in-season\nfresh tomatoes\n, preferably a mix of varieties, cored and diced (see notes)\n15\nlarge\nbasil leaves\n, thinly sliced into a chiffonade\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n, for the tomatoes and toasts\nRed or white wine vinegar or true\nbalsamic vinegar\n, to taste (optional; see notes)\n8\nmedium slices\nfreshly\ntoasted bread\n3\nmedium\ncloves garlic\n, halved\nFinishing sea salt (such as fleur de sel), kosher salt, or\nflaky salt\n(such as Maldon)\nDirections\nIn a large bowl, combine tomatoes with basil and enough olive oil to generously coat. If using wine vinegar, add a splash. Toss gently, taste, and add more wine vinegar if desired.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRub garlic cloves on top surface of each toast; rub only as much as you want. (More will make the toasts more garlicky, while a lighter hand will deliver a milder flavor.) Drizzle olive oil on each toast and season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpoon tomatoes onto each toast, including any liquid that has accumulated. Season generously with salt. If using true balsamic vinegar, drizzle it sparingly on top. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nUse whichever ripe varieties you can find, including cherry tomatoes (cut them into wedges instead of dice).\nIf you have true balsamic vinegar, drizzle it on top of the toasts; if not, it's better to add a splash of wine vinegar to the tomatoes, since it has better flavor than faux balsamic.\nRead More\nOven-Roasted Tomato Bruschetta\nPan con Tomate (Spanish-Style Grilled Bread With Tomato)\nSourdough Toasts With Tomato, Pesto, and Burrata\nThe Serious Eats Tomato Shopping Guide\nHow to Store Tomatoes (and Whether to Refrigerate Them)\nItalian\nDairy-free Snacks & Appetizers\nVegan Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nNo-Cook",
