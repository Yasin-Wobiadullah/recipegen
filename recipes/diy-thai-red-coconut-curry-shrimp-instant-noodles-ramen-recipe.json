Divide scallions and lime wedges between 4 small zipper-lock bags and seal bags, squeezing out all of the air. Tuck bags into jars and seal. Refrigerate for up to 4 days.\nWhen ready to serve, remove scallion packet and add boiling water to the top of the jar. Seal jar and let sit 2 minutes. Open jar, stir in scallions, squeeze with lime, and serve.\nNotes\nRed curry paste can be found in the Asian section of most supermarkets. I prefer Mae Ploy. Dry Thai or Vietnamese rice noodles can be used with no prep. Alternatively, use precooked and chilled ramen-style noodles or fresh Italian pasta. Cook the fresh noodles in boiling water for 1 minute, shock in cold water, drain well, toss with 2 teaspoons (10ml) oil until coated, then proceed with step 1.\nSpecial Equipment\n4 resealable 1-pint glass jars\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: Make Your Own Just-Add-Hot-Water Instant Noodles (and Make Your Coworkers Jealous)\nRamen\nThai\nDairy-free Mains\nStovetop Noodles\nShrimp"
