Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly but gently, until warm, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium and continue whisking until thick and steaming hot, about 3 minutes longer. When the custard begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for exactly 1 minute to neutralize a starch-dissolving enzyme found in egg yolks.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStrain into a non-reactive container, then whisk in cream, brandy, and orange blossom water, if using. Season to taste with additional salt, if needed. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), or cool to the same temperature in an ice bath. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nChurn the chilled base in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions, until fluffy and thick enough to gather in the dasher (about 30 minutes, but the timing will vary depending on the type of machine). When the ice cream is ready, shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape into the chilled container. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until firm enough to scoop, about 4 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n, non-reactive\nfine mesh strainer\n,\nice cream maker\n, non-reactive, freezer-safe container\nNotes\nHistorically, buttermilk has always been lowfat by nature, because it was a byproduct of churning butter. Modern manufacturing methods may not produce buttermilk the same way, but low-fat styles best mimic the flavor and body prized in the original.\nRead More\nThe Real Rules of Making Boozy Ice Cream\nSecret Tools and Tricks of the Ice Cream Pros\nOrange Buttermilk Sherbet\nTangy Lemon Frozen Yogurt\nIce Cream\nButtermilk\nSpring Desserts\nValentine's Day",
