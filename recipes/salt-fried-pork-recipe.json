Cut the leeks on a sharp bias into 1-inch slices. If you are without a razor-sharp knife, freeze the pork belly for 20 minutes prior to slicing.\nSwirl the oil into the wok and place over high heat until shimmering but not yet smoking. Add the slices of pork and stir-fry until the pork is lightly browned and has lost much of its water content, about 4 minutes.\nWhen the oil begins to sizzle, move aside the pork slices, grouping them as best you can on one side of the wok. Discard all but 1 tablespoon fat. Lower the heat to medium-low. Add the chili bean paste and fermented black beans into the pool of fat in the center of the wok and stir-fry until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Then allow the pork slices to re-enter the oily mixture, and stir-fry vigorously to incorporate, adding the soy sauce and sugar. Add the leeks or green onions. Continue to stir-fry just until the leeks/green onions are just cooked, about 1 minute. Taste the pork and season with salt if needed. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nwok\nThis Recipe Appears In\nAnother Way to Eat Pork: Salt-Fried Pork\nPork Mains\nFrying"
