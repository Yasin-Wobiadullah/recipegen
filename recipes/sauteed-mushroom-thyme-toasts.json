Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes. The mushrooms will look dry at first, but gradually their water will be drawn out. Once the water has evaporated, the mushrooms will be slightly browned.\nAdd shallot and 1 tablespoon (15g) butter to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, for another 2 to 3 minutes, until shallots are translucent and mushrooms are glossy. Remove pan from heat and add thyme, then add vinegar. Once vinegar is fully reduced, add remaining tablespoon of butter and stir to emulsify. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nTo serve, toast bread in a toaster or oven set to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Pile warm mushrooms on top of each slice. For extra richness and a more substantial serving, add a fried egg to each slice of mushroom-topped toast.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge saut\u00e9 pan\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBeer Pairing 101: Malty and Sweet Beers\nCremini & Button Mushrooms\nScandinavian\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Vegetables\nSandwiches"
