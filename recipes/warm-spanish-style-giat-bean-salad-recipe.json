You can also find them in specialty Italian, Greek, or Spanish import markets. This dish can also be made with dried beans: Soak 1 cup of dried beans in a large bowl of salted water overnight at room temperature. Rinse the beans and cook them in salted water until tender, about 45 minutes. Drain, spread into a single layer on a towel-lined baking sheet, and let them cool.
