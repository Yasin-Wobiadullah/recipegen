Place a wire rack inside a baking sheet; set aside.\nIn a shallow dish or plate, stir together flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Set aside a large plate to transfer chicken to after breading.\nWorking with one chicken breast at a time, place chicken breast on a cutting board. Hold it in place with the palm of your non-cutting hand, and use a sharp knife to slice chicken horizontally into two even cutlets. Repeat process with remaining chicken breast. Cover each breast half with plastic wrap, and use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound to 1/3-inch thickness.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nPlace 2 chicken halves in prepared flour mixture, and turn to coat; tap off excess flour mixture, and transfer chicken to the large plate. Repeat process with remaining chicken halves.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nIn a large stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high until shimmering. Working in batches, add two chicken pieces to hot oil; cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes total. Repeat process with remaining 2 chicken pieces. Place browned chicken halves on prepared baking sheet, and place in warm oven (do not wipe out skillet).\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nWhile chicken is resting in oven, heat the same skillet over medium-high. Add wine; cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet, until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Add stock and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture has reduced to about 1/3 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add garlic, butter, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of parsley, 1 tablespoon of chives, 2 teaspoons tarragon (if using), remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook, swirling and stirring constantly, until butter is completely melted, about 1 minute. Spoon sauce over chicken, and garnish with remaining chives, parsley, and additional tarragon (if using), lemon zest, and flaky salt. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nEquipment\nBaking sheet, wire rack, large stainless-steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet\nNotes\nYou can use 4 store-bought chicken breast cutlets instead of whole chicken breasts, but pounding your own ensures even thickness and more reliable cooking.\nBoth American- and European-style butter will work for this recipe, but we recommend seeking out European-style butter, as its higher fat content produces a more richly flavored sauce.\nChicken\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nRecipes By Ingredients\nChicken Breast"
