Water should cover, but if not, add enough to just cover salmon. Set over medium heat and bring poaching liquid to 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C). Adjusting heat to maintain water temperature, cook salmon until it registers 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) when an instant-read thermometer is inserted into the thickest part of the fish, about 20 minutes. (Cooking time may vary widely, so be sure to check temperatures to determine doneness.) Carefully transfer salmon to a plate to rest for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nMeanwhile, for the Yogurt Sauce:\nIn a medium bowl, stir together yogurt, shallot, dill, lemon juice, olive oil, and ground coriander seeds. Season with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nServe salmon while warm, spooning yogurt sauce on top, or let it cool to room temperature before serving. You can also chill the salmon and yogurt sauce before serving.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge saucepan\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nHow to Shop for Sustainable Seafood\nSous Vide Salmon Recipe\nSalmon\nStovetop Seafood\nYogurt & Cultured Dairy\nSeafood Mains\nQuick Dinners"
