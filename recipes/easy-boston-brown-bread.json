Place a trivet or steamer insert into the bottom of a tall stockpot, fill with water to reach 1 1/2 inches above the trivet. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and bring to a simmer over medium-high.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together rye flour, raisins, cornmeal, baking soda, and salt until evenly combined. Whisk in buttermilk and molasses until just combined. Divide batter evenly between prepared cans (about 1 cup/200g batter per can; the batter should fill the cans no more than 2/3 of the way full). Place a small square of foil over the top of each can to serve as a lid and secure with a heavy-duty rubber band or string.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nSet cans on trivet in the pot of boiling water. The water should reach about halfway up the sides of the cans (if not, add additional hot water). Cover and return to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer until bread is set and gently pulling away from sides of cans, 35 to 40 minutes. A skewer inserted into the center should come out with moist crumbs and a thermometer inserted into the center should register between 200\u00b0F and 205\u00b0F.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nRemove cans from pot using tongs, set on a cooling rack, and remove foil lids. Let bread cool in cans slightly, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove bread from cans by turning each can upside down and tapping the bottom of the can with the heel of your palm. Let loaves cool completely on wire rack, about 1 hour. Serve plain or toasted with cream cheese, preferably the next day (the flavors meld and improve with this resting time).\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nSpecial Equipment\nThree 14.5 to 15-ounce cans,\ntall stockpot\n, trivet or\nsteamer insert\n,\nwhisk\n, foil, string or rubber bands,\ndigital thermometer\n,\ncooling rack\nRead More\nGluten-Free Boston Brown Bread Recipe\nThe Difference Between Blackstrap Molasses and True Molasses\nQuick Breads"
