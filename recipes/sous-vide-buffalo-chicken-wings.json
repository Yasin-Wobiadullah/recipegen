Place wings in zipper-lock bags (you may need multiple bags to easily hold all the wings). Alternatively, slide wings into vacuum bags and seal according to vacuum-sealer manufacturer's instructions. If using zipper-lock bags, seal using the\nwater-displacement method\n. Add bagged wings to immersion circulator and cook for 2 hours if cooking at 160\u00b0F or 1 hour if cooking at 165\u00b0F.\nSerious Eats / Joel Russo\nRemove wings from bags and pat dry; discard juices. Arrange wings on wire racks set on rimmed baking sheets and refrigerate, uncovered, for 8 hours or up to 2 days.\nSerious Eats / Joel Russo\nWhen ready to serve, in a small saucepan, combine butter and Frank's and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is completely melted. Transfer to a large bowl.\nMeanwhile, in a wok or Dutch oven, heat oil to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C). Working in small batches, carefully add chicken and cook, stirring and flipping occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 375 to 400\u00b0F (190 to 205\u00b0C), until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes per batch. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer wings to paper towels to drain. When all the wings have been fried, transfer to bowl with sauce, toss to coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and celery.\nSerious Eats / Joel Russo\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion circulator\n,\nwok\nor\nDutch oven\n,\nwire rack\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can cook the wings sous vide up to 2 days in advance. Keep them uncovered on the wire rack in the fridge until ready to fry.\nSous Vide Chicken\nFried Chicken\nChicken Wings\nChicken Mains\nSnacks & Appetizers"
