Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add basil and cook for another 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until lighter in color and slightly thickened.\nTransfer mixture to a blender and blend on high for two minutes or until smooth. Pour through a fine-mesh strainer back into saucepan.\nTip:\nIf your blender comes with a plastic stopper insert in the lid, remove it and cover the opening with a few folds of paper towel. This will prevent hot liquids from bursting out the top.\nQuickly whisk yolk-sugar mixture into corn-basil base, and cook on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until mixture coats the back of a spoon and a finger swipe leaves a clean line. Add salt to taste. Strain into in an airtight container and let chill overnight, then churn the next day according to manufacturer's instructions.\nSpecial equipment\nice cream maker, blender\nIce Cream\nHeavy Cream\nCorn\nBasil"
