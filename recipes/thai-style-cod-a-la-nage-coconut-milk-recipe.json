Add shallot, garlic, and chile and cook, stirring, until vegetables are softened and shallot is translucent, about 2 minutes.\nAdd coconut milk (and broth, if using; see notes), fish sauce, lime peel, ginger, lemongrass, cilantro sprigs, and basil sprigs. Season cod with salt and pepper, then nestle in coconut broth; the fish should be partially submerged. Bring liquid to a simmer, then cover pan and lower heat. Cook, covered, until cod is just cooked through and registers 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.\nUsing a slotted spatula, transfer cod to bowls. Whisk lime juice into broth. Season broth with salt and pepper, then ladle all around fish in the bowls along with the vegetables. Garnish with cilantro and basil leaves. Serve right away with lime wedges on the side.\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nUsing all coconut milk makes a thicker, richer broth; for a lighter version, use only one can of coconut milk and replace the other with 14 ounces of vegetable or fish broth.\nRead More\nHalibut \u00e0 la Nage With Clams, Dill, and White Wine Recipe\nSalmon \u00e0 la Nage With Summer Vegetables Recipe\nCod\nMilk\nPoached Seafood\nLime\nCoconut Milk & Cream"
