Place flour in a large bowl. If making sweet biscuits, whisk in sugar. Stirring with a wooden spoon, drizzle in cream. Stir until a lumpy dough is formed. Do not over mix.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nFor Drop Biscuits:\nUsing a 1-ounce cookie scoop, scoop balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart. Brush tops with cream and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nFor Flaky Rolled Biscuits:\nWith a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12-inch square. Using a bench scraper, fold the right third of the dough over the center, then fold the left third over so you end up with a 12-by-4-inch rectangle. Fold the top third down over the center, then fold the bottom third up so the whole thing is reduced to a 4-inch square. Press the square down and roll it out again into a 12-inch square. Repeat the folding process once more, then roll the dough again into a 12-inch square. Use a 3- to 4-inch biscuit cutter to cut out rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spaced 2 inches apart. Press together scraps to form additional biscuits. Brush tops with cream and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nBiscuits",
