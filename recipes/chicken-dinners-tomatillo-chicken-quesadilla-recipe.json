In medium saucepan over medium heat, heat chicken broth to simmer. Add cilantro stems to broth.\nAdd chicken to broth and gently cook until just cooked through (chicken should register 155 to 160\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer), 8 to 10 minutes, reducing heat if necessary to maintain a bare simmer. Transfer chicken to plate and shred into small bite-sized pieces when cool enough to handle.\nWhile chicken is cooking, pulse tomatillos, onion, jalapenos, lime juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cilantro leaves in food processor to form a medium chunky consistency. Do not puree. Season to taste with more salt as desired.\nHeat large cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Place one tortilla in pan and sprinkle with 1/4 of cheese. Arrange 1/4 of the chicken pieces over cheese and spread 1/4 of the salsa over the chicken. Place a tortilla on top and gently press with spatula.\nCook until both sides are crisp, brown, and spotty, and cheese has melted, 1 to 2 minutes per side, adjusting heat so as not to burn tortillas. Continue with remaining ingredients to form 4 quesadillas total. Cut into wedges and serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nFood Processor\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nCheese\nChicken Breast\nTomatillo"
