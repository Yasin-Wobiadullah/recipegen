Simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, raspberries are broken down, and sauce is slightly thickened. Using a fine-mesh sieve, strain sauce into a medium bowl; discard solids and set sauce aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Peaches:\nIn a large saucepan or Dutch oven, bring water, sugar, honey, lemon juice, and vanilla paste to a boil over high heat. In a large bowl, set up an ice bath by filling it halfway with cold water and ice. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a sharp paring knife, score a small X at the base of each peach; set aside. Lower peaches into boiling syrup with slotted spoon, reduce heat to a simmer, and poach peaches, turning halfway through, until flesh is tender when pierced with a knife, about 6 minutes, Using a slotted spoon, transfer peaches to the ice bath and let stand until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Reserve poaching liquid. (See make-ahead and storage.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWorking with 1 peach at a time, start at scored X on the base of peach and, using a paring knife, peel back and remove loosened skin from peach. Discard skins and repeat with remaining peaches. Cut each peach in half through stem and remove pit. Slice peeled peach halves into thirds. (See notes.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo serve, place a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream in a bowl and top with peach slices and raspberry sauce.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nVanilla extract or a full vanilla bean, split, may be substituted for vanilla paste.\nIf your peach isn\u2019t a freestone peach, its pit may not release easily. If you can\u2019t remove the pit easily, cut off the cheeks of the peach, flush to the pit, and the remaining sides, and slice them as best as you can.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe raspberry sauce can be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container.\nThe peaches can be poached up to 3 days in advance. Once cooled, the cooked peach halves can be refrigerated with their poaching liquid in an airtight container. The poaching liquid can be reused to poach more peaches, used in a cocktail, or stirred into sparkling water to make a non-alcoholic beverage.\nPeach\nThe Latest\nSummer Desserts\nSummer"
