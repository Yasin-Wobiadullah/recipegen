  "full_text": "Gluten-Free Sweet Potato Latkes Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nmedium\nonion\n(about 8 ounces; 227g), peeled\n1\npound\n(454g)\nsweet potatoes\n, peeled (about 2 large sweet potatoes)\n1/2\ncup\nwhite rice flour\n2\nteaspoons\nDiamond Crystal kosher\nsalt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\n1\nteaspoon\nfreshly\nground black pepper\n3\nlarge\neggs\n, beaten\nVegetable oil\n, for frying\nSour cream and\napplesauce\nfor serving\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F (90\u00b0C). Grate onion and sweet potatoes using a food processor fitted with a medium grate, or on the large holes of a box grater. Combine in a medium bowl.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nPlace half of the onion and potato mixture on a clean kitchen towel. Roll the towel around the mixture and wring the towel to draw out excess moisture. Unroll the towel and transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining onion and potatoes.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the white rice flour, salt, and pepper. Add to the potato mixture and stir to combine. Add the eggs and stir to combine. Line a rimmed baking sheet with several layers of paper towels and set it near the stove but safely away from the burner. Heat 1/4 inch of oil in an 8-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nWorking in batches, drop the potato mixture into the hot oil by scant 1/4-cups. (The mixture should sizzle when it hits the oil.) Using two forks, flatten each latke a little in the pan. (You almost \u201cpull\u201d the latkes apart to flatten.)\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nFry until deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a pancake flipper or spatula and fry an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven while you cook remaining latkes. Serve with sour cream and apple sauce.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpecial Equipment\n8-inch\ncast iron skillet\nNotes\nIf you prefer your sweet potatoes a little sweeter, add one peeled, grated Granny Smith apple to the mixture.\nTo ensure crispy latkes, fry no more than three latkes at a time. This ensures that oil doesn't get cold. Cold oil equals greasy latkes!\nSweet Potatoes\nVegetarian\nFrying\nHanukkah",
