Place 2 new lids in a small pot of water and bring to the barest simmer.\nSlice daikon into thin rounds using a mandoline, food processor or knife. Keep the slices around 1/4 inch thick so that they retain some crunch.\nCombine rice wine vinegar, water, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.\nDivide peppercorns between your two jars.\nPack daikon slices into jars. One pound should fit perfectly into two pint jars. Top with boiling brine, leaving 1/2 inch headspace.\nTap jars gently to remove any trapped air bubbles. If necessary, add more brine to return the headspace to 1/2 inch.\nWipe rims, apply lids and rings and process jars in a boiling water bath canner for 10 minutes (start your timer when the water returns to a boil, not when the jars first go in).\nWhen time is up, remove jars from canner and let cool on a folded kitchen towel.\nWhen jars are cool enough to handle, remove rings and test seals by grasping edges of lids and carefully lifting jars. If lids hold fast, seals are good.\nStore jars in a cool, dark place. They are ready to eat within 48 hours, but can be kept up to one year.\nSpecial equipment\nmason jars, boiling water bath canner\nThis Recipe Appears In\nIn a Pickle: Sweet Pickled Daikon Radish\nRadishes\nVegetarian\nPickling"
