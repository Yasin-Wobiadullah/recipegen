Remove some of the mixture to a separate small bowl and reserve for garnish.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPlace macaroni in a large saucepan and cover it with salted water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep pasta from sticking. Cover pan, remove from heat, and let stand until pasta is barely al dente, about 8 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk together evaporated milk, eggs, hot sauce, and mustard in a bowl until homogeneous. Toss cheeses with cornstarch in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.\nWhen pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to saucepan. Place over low heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Add bacon/jalape\u00f1o mixture (including bacon fat), milk mixture, and cheese mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is completely melted and mixture is hot and creamy. Season to taste with salt and more hot sauce. Serve immediately, topped with reserved bacon/jalape\u00f1o mixture.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nNotes\nTo reheat the pasta, add a few tablespoons of milk to the pan and cook, stirring gently, over medium-low heat until hot.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's Ultra-Gooey Stovetop Mac and Cheese\nBacon and Pimento Macaroni and Cheese\nEasy Stovetop 'Nduja Mac and Cheese\nBuffalo Chicken Macaroni and Cheese\nGreen Chile Chicken Macaroni and Cheese\nPasta Mains\nAmerican\nCheese\nMac & Cheese",
