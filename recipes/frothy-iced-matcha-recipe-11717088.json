  "full_text": "Frothy Iced Matcha\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n2 mins\nTotal\n2 mins\nServes\n1 serving\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nteaspoons\n(\n6\ng\n)\nJapanese matcha green tea\n(see note)\n8\nounces\n(\n235\nml\n) cold\nwater\nDirections\nIn a cocktail shaker or sealable plastic container, combine matcha and water, seal tightly, then shake vigorously for about 15 seconds. Pour into a bowl or large mug with ice and serve.\nNotes\nJapanese matcha tea is a talc-like powder made from finely ground green tea leaves; it comes in many grades and quality levels, with prices to match. Choose the most affordable one you can find that you like for this casual-drinking application. We settled on a ratio of 2 teaspoons matcha per 8 ounces of water, but feel free to adjust for a stronger or lighter result, depending on your taste. (Note, though, that the less tea you use, the more difficult it will be to form a stable foam.)\nTeas\nRecipes\nJapanese\nSummer Drinks\nDrinks"
