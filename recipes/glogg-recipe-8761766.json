Transfer the strained ingredients to a spice bag. (Alternatively, you may use cheesecloth and twine.)\nIn the same 3-quart saucier, add the spice bag, spiced syrup, wine, port, aquavit, raisins, and almonds. Bring the mixture to a bare simmer over high heat, but do not boil. Turn off heat, cover, and allow to steep, until fragrant and infused, at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.\nWhen ready to serve, ladle gl\u00f6gg into mugs or cups, scooping a few raisins and almonds into each one.\nNotes\nThis recipe works best with dry, unsweet wines such as Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and Merlot.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTo make gl\u00f6gg ahead of time, remove the spice bag after step 3, then allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 3-quart saucier until warm, but do not let it boil.\nWinter Drinks\nChristmas\nDrinks"
