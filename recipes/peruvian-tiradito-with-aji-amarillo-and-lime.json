Boil for 10 minutes, stirring pot from time to time to rotate peppers. Remove from heat and drain. Allow to cool.\nMeanwhile, using a sharp slicing knife, slice fish into thin slabs. Arrange slices on plates and transfer to refrigerator.\nSerious Eats /Vicky Wasik\nIn a blender, combine lime juice with garlic and ginger and blend on high speed until garlic and ginger are fully processed. Transfer to a medium mixing bowl. Rinse blender jar.\nRemove and discard seeds and stems from chile peppers. Strip off as much of the chile skin as you can and discard it. Transfer chile flesh to blender jar and blend at high speed, adding only enough water to get things moving, until a smooth pur\u00e9e forms.\nStir 1/2 cup (120ml) aj\u00ed\u00a0amarillo paste into the lime juice until thoroughly combined. (You can add less or more chile paste to your taste, but keep in mind that in addition to heat and flavor, it also gives the sauce viscosity. If you add too little, the sauce will be very thin.) Season with salt. Reserve remaining aj\u00ed\u00a0amarillo paste for another use.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStir in cilantro. Remove plates from refrigerator and spoon sauce on top of fish, lightly coating it (reserve any remaining sauce for another use). If desired, garnish plates with choclo and/or sweet potato. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nsharp slicing knife\nNotes\nYou can find frozen aj\u00ed\u00a0amarillo peppers in the freezer section of a well-stocked Latin grocer; a jar of aj\u00ed\u00a0amarillo paste is also found at Latin grocers and online as well. Making the paste from frozen peppers yields a more flavorful result, highlighting more of aj\u00ed\u00a0amarillo's floral and fruity notes.\nChoclo is a variety of Peruvian corn with large, white kernels; you can find it in the freezer section of grocers that sell Peruvian ingredients; boil it for several minutes to tenderize the kernels before serving.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe aj\u00ed\u00a0amarillo paste can be made up to three days in advance and kept refrigerated in an airtight container.\nRead More\nWhat Is \"Sushi-Grade,\" Anyway?
