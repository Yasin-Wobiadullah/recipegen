Stir in cumin, chiles, and cinnamon, and fry for thirty seconds or until spices are fragrant.\nAdd tomatilos, chicken, water, and several large pinches of salt (better to err on too much than too little here).

Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for one hour, until chicken is very tender.\nTake pot off heat and remove chicken pieces and let cool for ten minutes. Remove skin and shred off the bone, leaving chicken in large chunks. Red fat will have risen to surface of pot; skim off most but leave some in for flavor.
