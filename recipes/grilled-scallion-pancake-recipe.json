With processor running, slowly drizzle in about 3/4 of boiling water. Process for 15 seconds. If dough does not come together and ride around the blade, drizzle in more water a tablespoon at a time until it just comes together. Transfer to a floured work surface and knead a few times to form a smooth ball. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature, or up to overnight in the fridge.\nDivide dough into four even pieces and roll each into a smooth ball. Working one ball at a time, roll out into a disk roughly 8-inches in diameter on a lightly floured surface. Using a pastry brush, paint a very thin layer of sesame oil over the top of the disk. Season with salt.\nRoll disk up like a jelly roll.\nTwist roll into a tight spiral, tucking the end underneath. Flatten gently with your hand, then re-roll into an 8-inch disk.\nPaint with another layer or sesame oil, sprinkle with 1/2 cup scallions, and roll up like a jelly roll again.\nTwist into a spiral and flatten gently.\nRe-roll into a 7-inch disk, brush with oil, and transfer to a plate lined in foil or parchment paper. Repeat steps two and three with remaining pancakes and stack them.\nFor the Sauce:\nCombine all the sauce ingredients and set aside at room temperature.\nGrill the Pancakes\n:\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate.
