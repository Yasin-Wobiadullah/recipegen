Roll dough into a 1-inch wide log, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate 1 hour.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put egg wash in one shallow bowl and za'atar spice in another.\nCut dough into 1/4-inch slices. Brush each with egg wash and then press lightly into zaatar blend. Place cookies on baking sheet and bake until golden at the edges, about 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n, parchment paper, pastry brush\nNotes\nBecause za'atar is a spice blend, its exact contents will vary by brand. Most contain sesame seeds, sumac, and salt, and other additions such as marjoram and thyme are common. I've never really met a za'atar I didn't like, but if you want to be sure, give it a try before using.\nCookies\nSavory\nSnacks & Appetizers"
