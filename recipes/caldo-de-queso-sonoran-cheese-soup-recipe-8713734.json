Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender when poked with a fork, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jackie Alpers\nMeanwhile, in a separate small saucepan, add the evaporated milk and heat over medium heat until warmed through and just simmering. Reduce the soup pot heat to low, and slowly pour in the warmed evaporated milk while stirring constantly. Add the oregano, and cook until warmed through but not fully simmering, about 5 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt or bouillon powder and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Jackie Alpers\nWhen ready to serve, in the bottom of each individual serving bowl, place 1/4 cup of the shredded cheese. Ladle the hot soup over top. Sprinkle with crushed chiltepin chile (if using) and more oregano. Serve with warm tortillas for scooping.\nSerious Eats / Jackie alpers\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven or soup pot, small saucepan\nNotes\nCanned green chilies make this a soup anyone anywhere can make any time of the year, but if freshly roasted Anaheim or Hatch chiles are also good alternatives.\nI prefer to season the soup with chicken bouillon powder for extra flavor, but you can use just kosher salt for seasoning.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup can be cooked through step 2, cooled, and refrigerated for up to 5 days. To serve, bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat while stirring occasionally before proceeding with step 3.\nSoups\nThe Latest\nCheese\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex",
