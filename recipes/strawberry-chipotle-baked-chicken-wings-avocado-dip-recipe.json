Dry chicken wings with paper towels. In a large zipper-lock bag, toss wings with baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt until evenly coated, then arrange wings on an even layer on the rack. Refrigerate wings, uncovered, overnight or up to 18 hours.\nPreheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) and set the oven rack in the upper-middle position. Bake wings on the rack set over the baking sheet for 20 minutes, then flip and continue to bake until cooked through and crisp, about 20 minutes longer.\nMeanwhile, in a saucepan over medium heat, combine strawberries, vinegar, garlic, ginger, and light brown sugar and cook until strawberries are softened and release their juices, about 10 minutes. Mash strawberries with a wooden spoon and stir in minced chipotle, adobo sauce, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (1/8 or 1/4 teaspoon depending on your heat preference). Season with salt. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 5 minutes. If sauce becomes too thick and candy-like, stir in water or chicken stock to return to desired consistency. If any chunks of strawberry remain, transfer to a blender or food processor and pulse until smooth. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nIn a blender or food processor, combine avocado, sour cream, blue cheese, lemon juice, and milk. Season with salt (taste first, as blue cheese is salty). Pulse until well-combined, transfer to a bowl, and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nPlace the baked wings in a large bowl and toss with the strawberry sauce until evenly coated. Transfer to a plate and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Garnish with cilantro and serve with avocado blue cheese dip.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nfood processor\nNotes\nIf preparing the avocado blue cheese dip in advance, squeeze some extra lemon juice on top, then cover with plastic wrap, pressing it flush against the surface to prevent oxidation.\nChicken Wings\nRoasted Chicken\nStrawberry\nChicken Mains\nSnacks & Appetizers",
