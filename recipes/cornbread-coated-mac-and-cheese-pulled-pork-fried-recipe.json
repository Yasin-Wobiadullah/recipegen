Press chilled macaroni and cheese in an even layer in the baking sheet. Sprinkle all over with jalape\u00f1o peppers and shredded cheese. With the short side of the baking sheet in front of you, layer the pulled pork evenly on half of the macaroni and cheese layer.\nUsing the parchment paper, fold the macaroni layer without pork over the half with pork to sandwich it. Place another baking sheet on top and press gently to condense. Transfer to the freezer and freeze until solid, at least 1 hour.\nDiscard parchment paper. Cut the layered macaroni and pork into squares, and then cut diagonally to create triangles. Return to freezer.\nIn a large cast iron skillet or wok, heat 2 inches of oil to 350\u00b0F. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and baking soda. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add milk and eggs. Whisk together until smooth.\nRemove macaroni and pork triangles from freezer. Dip a few at a time into the batter and, using a spoon, transfer them to the oil. Cook, flipping halfway, until golden brown and warmed through, 3-4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the wedges to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat until all of the wedges have been fried. Serve warm, garnished with sliced jalape\u00f1os and barbecue sauce alongside for dipping.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet or wok\nNotes\nAny leftover mac and cheese and pulled pork will work (or you can even sub in store-bought, if you'd like), but here are some recommended recipes for the\nmacaroni and cheese\nand the\npulled pork\n.
