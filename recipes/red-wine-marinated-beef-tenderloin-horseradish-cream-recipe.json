Add wine, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, oregano, thyme, 2 teaspoons dill, and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Seal, squish around to combine, and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 4 to 6 hours.\nWhen ready to cook, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Remove meat from refrigerator and pat dry with paper towels.\nSeason meat with salt and pepper. Fold small end of tenderloin back on itself by a few inches to create an even thickness. Secure meat with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals to create an evenly-sized roast.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nHeat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large, oven-safe roasting pan or Dutch oven until shimmering. Sear meat until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes total. Add marinade to the pan and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Transfer meat to the oven to cook until meat reaches an internal temperature of 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) as registered on an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare, 20 to 30 minutes.\nRemove meat from oven, transfer to a platter and allow to rest for 10 minutes. While meat is resting, deglaze pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat, adding beef broth and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Swirl in butter to finish the sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary.\nIn a small bowl, mix sour cream, horseradish, parsley, mint, remaining 2 teaspoons dill and remaining 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.\nCut string from roast and discard. Slice meat and place on a platter. Drizzle with pan sauce and serve immediately with horseradish cream.\nSpecial Equipment\nRoasting pan\nor\nDutch oven\n, kitchen twine\nNotes\nThe horseradish cream sauce may be made and refrigerated up to four hours ahead.\nRoasted Beef\nTenderloin Steak\nBeef Mains\nChristmas Dinners\nWinter Mains"
