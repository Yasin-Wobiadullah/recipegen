Cook beans to crisp tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to large bowl to cool.\nHeat 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Pour in beaten eggs and swirl to coat entire bottom of pan with a thin layer of egg. Cover and cook until just cooked through (top won't look wet), 30 seconds to a minute. Slide the egg omelette onto cutting board. When cool, roll up into a log. Cut the log in half lengthwise, then cut into 1-inch strips.\nIn same skillet, heat remaining oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add sambal and makrut lime leaves and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken and cook, breaking up into small pieces, until almost cooked through, about 4 minutes.\nPour in chicken broth, coconut milk, and salt. Simmer until liquid is slightly thickened and gently coats chicken. Transfer to large bowl with the cooked green beans and gently toss with the egg and coconut.\nTransfer to serving bowl, top with crispy shallots, and serve with steamed rice.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch non-stick skillet with lid\nNotes\nThe cooking is easy, but there are multiple parts to this dish, so it may take a bit of time to prepare. The ingredient list is long, a common theme in many Southeast Asian dishes.\nCandlenuts\nare an Indonesian nut with a waxy texture. The flavor is mild in this dish, but the nut adds body to the sambal. If unable to find them, try substituting macadamia nuts.\nMakrut lime\nleaves impart a fragrant citrusy flavor and aroma, but you can substitute 1 teaspoon lime zest added at the end of cooking (the flavor won't be quite the same though). Look for these ingredients in your local Asian grocery store.\nRead More\nEssential Indonesian Ingredients and How to Use Them\nNasi Goreng (Indonesian Fried Rice)\nBalinese Pork Satay (Sate Babi)\nIndonesian\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop\nChicken",
