Place fish fillets on a wire rack set in a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate uncovered to dry out exterior, at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen ready to cook, set a wire rack inside a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet. Fill a large Dutch oven with oil and heat over medium until it registers 350\u00baF (177\u00baC) on an instant-read or deep-fry thermometer. Place 1 cup (4 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour in a large bowl; add fish and toss to evenly coat; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Batter:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk 1/2 cup (2 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour, rice flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt to combine. Add lager and vodka, whisking until just combined. Transfer fish to batter and turn to coat.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWorking with one piece at a time, pick up fillet and allow excess batter to drip back into bowl. Carefully lower fish into the oil and cook until bottom is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Use tongs or a spider skimmer to turn the fish and cook until other side is golden brown and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to prepared wire rack. Season immediately with salt and spritz generously with malt vinegar. Repeat with remaining fish. Serve with British chips and tartar sauce, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet, wire rack, instant-read or deep-fry thermometer, whisk, spider skimmer or tongs\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nFish and chips are best enjoyed immediately.\nFish\nThe Latest\nBritish\nFried Seafood",
