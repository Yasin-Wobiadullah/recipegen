  "full_text": "Champorado (Filipino Rice Porridge With Chocolate)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n3 hrs\nCook\n45 mins\nTotal\n3 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/4\ncups\nglutinous sticky rice\n(9 ounces; 260g), see note\nOne\n13.5-ounce\n(400ml) can\ncoconut milk\n4 1/2\nounces\n(135g) finely chopped\nchocolate\n, preferably from an equal-parts mix of chocolates that include one very dark (100%) and then one or two moderately dark and/or semisweet chocolates (60-70%)\n2\ntablespoons\n(30g)\ngranulated sugar\n1/2\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\nCondensed milk\n, for serving\nFor the Spicy Candied Anchovies (optional):\n1\nounce\n(30g)\ndried salted anchovies\n, see note\n1\nfresh green or\nred Thai chile\n, stemmed and finely chopped\n1/4\ncup\ngranulated sugar\n(1 3/4 ounces; 50g)\nDirections\nFor the Champorado:\nPlace rice in a medium bowl and cover by at least 2 inches of room temperature water. Cover bowl and let soak at room temperature for at least 3 hours and up to overnight. Drain rice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a 6-quart pot, add 2 cups (475ml) water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add soaked rice and coconut milk and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot constantly with a wooden spatula or spoon to prevent sticking, until liquid has been mostly absorbed and rice is almost fully softened, 15 to 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReduce the heat to maintain a simmer, then stir in chocolate, sugar, and salt until chocolate is melted and thoroughly incorporated; make sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent the starch from sticking and burning. The consistency of the rice should be similar to porridge or thick congee. Cover pot and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, for the Spicy Candied Anchovies (optional):\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat a 10-inch stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add anchovies and chile, and cook for 1 minute to allow the flavors to meld.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd sugar, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring constantly to prevent crystallization on the sides, until anchovies are caramelized and deep amber in color, 3 to 5 minutes (the anchovies should be fully coated in the caramelized sugar). Transfer candied anchovies to prepared baking sheet, spreading in as thin a layer as possible, and let cool completely. Once cool, use your hands to break the anchovies apart.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Serve:\nScoop champorado into individual serving bowls, drizzle with condensed milk, and top with candied anchovies (if using). Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nYou can use either long-grain sticky rice like Filipino malagkit or short-grain sticky rice for champorado.\nYou can opt to use Filipino tablea (roasted cacao tablets) instead of the mix of chocolate bars; tablea should also be chopped finely before adding to your rice.\nYou can also opt to serve with daing or tuyo (other dried fish) that are quickly toasted in a skillet without the chile and caramel, if desired.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nChamporado can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. To reheat, warm champorado in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes; if using a stovetop, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency.\nCandied anchovies can be stored in an airtight container for 1 to 2 weeks.\nRice & Grains\nFilipino\nCoconut Milk & Cream",
