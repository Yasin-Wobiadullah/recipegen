With machine running, slowly drizzle in canola oil, stopping machine to scrape down sides as necessary. Mixture should begin to form a thick emulsion. If using a food processor, transfer to a large bowl set in a heavy pot lined with a dish towel to stabilize, then, whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in olive oil until a thick mayonnaise forms. Alternatively, if using a stand mixer, continue to use the mixer's whisk attachment to add the olive oil. Add up to 1 tablespoon water, whisking constantly, until mixture lightens in color and is thin enough to slowly fall off of a spoon when held vertically. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSlather mayonnaise on top of toast and top with tomatoes. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt and serve immediately before salt dissolves.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n(or\nstand mixer\n), or a whisk with a really strong wrist.\nNotes\nUse only the best summer tomatoes and high quality bread for this recipe.\nExtra-virgin olive oil can become bitter when blended in a food processor; therefore we recommend hand-whisking in the olive oil. A stand mixer can continue to be used for the olive oil without trouble.\nThe mayonnaise can also be made completely manually with a whisk. To keep the bowl steady, drape a clean dish towel over the top of a medium-sized saucepan. Place a large bowl on top of it. It should remain stable as you whisk.\nRead More\nTwo-Minute Mayonnaise Recipe\nSandwiches\nVegetarian\nTomato",
