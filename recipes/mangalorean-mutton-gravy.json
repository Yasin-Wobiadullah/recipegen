Allow to rest while you make the masala paste, or up to overnight in the refrigerator.\nTo Make the Masala:\nPreheat cast iron pan over high heat until smoking. Reduce heat to medium. add cinnamon, poppy seeds, chiles, coconut, coriander, cumin, and cloves. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl and allow to cool completely. Transfer to a blender, add onion and pulse, adding 1 cup of water in small increments until a smooth paste is formed.\nHeat oil in the heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium-low and add masala paste. Cook, stirring constantly until oil separates, about 10 minutes. The oil should take on the red color of the masala at this stage. (Take care to stand out of the way, masala pastes splutter.)\nAdd the lamb pieces and potato and stir until coated with masala paste. Add 2 cups water, stir to combine, and season lightly with salt (broth will reduce, so do not overseason). Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, covered, until the lamb is completely tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Season to taste with salt.\nGarnish with a sprinkle of lime and the coriander leaves. Serve hot with a loaf of bread or white rice.\nIndian\nBraised & Stewed Lamb\nCoconut\nLamb Shank\nChile Pepper",
