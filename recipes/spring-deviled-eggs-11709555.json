Fill a medium pot with water and bring to a boil. Carefully lower eggs into pot and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer), and continue cooking for 11 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer eggs to prepared ice bath and let cool, about 3 minutes. Peel eggs under cool running water, then slice each egg in half lengthwise.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer yolks to a medium bowl. Add mayonnaise, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, pickled onion, lemon juice, Dijon, tarragon, and cayenne. Using a fork or sturdy whisk, mash and stir together until thoroughly combined. Season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer yolk filling to zipper-lock bag or piping bag. Cut off corner of zipper-lock bag or piping bag and pipe filling mixture into egg white halves, overstuffing each hole. Garnish deviled eggs with more minced pickled onion and small tarragon leaves. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nSlotted spoon, zipper-lock bag or piping bag\nNotes\nVery fresh eggs tend to have their shells stick to the whites more, making peeling more difficult. Eggs that are slightly older are best for hard boiling.\nIf desired, you can substitute the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in the recipe with additional mayonnaise; you may need to add a touch more lemon juice to balance the flavor.\nEggs\nThe Latest\nSnacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian\nEaster Appetizers",
