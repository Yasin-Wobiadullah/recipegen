  "full_text": "Baking with Dorie: Lemon-Lemon Lemon Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n35 mins\nChilling Time\n4 hrs\nTotal\n4 hrs 40 mins\nServes\n8\nto 12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nsugar\nFinely grated\nzest\nof\n3\nlemons\n4\nlarge\neggs\n3/4\ncup\nfreshly squeezed lemon juice\n(from\n4 to 5\nlemons\n)\n2\nsticks\nplus\n5\ntablespoons\n(\n21\ntablespoons\n;\n10 1/2\nounces\n)\nunsalted butter\n, at room temperature and cut into tablespoon-sized pieces\n1\nfully-baked 9-inch tart shell\nDirections\nGetting ready:\nHave a thermometer, preferably an instant-read, a strainer and a blender (first choice) or food processor at the ready. Bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a saucepan.\nPut the sugar and zest in a large metal bowl that can be fitted into the pan of simmering water. Off heat, work the sugar and zest together between your fingers until the sugar is moist, grainy and very aromatic. Whisk in the eggs followed by the lemon juice.\nFit the bowl into the pan (make certain the water doesn\u2019t touch the bottom of the bowl) and cook, stirring with the whisk as soon as the mixture feels tepid to the touch. You want to cook the cream until it reaches 180\u00b0F. As you whisk the cream over heat\u2014and you must whisk constantly to keep the eggs from scrambling\u2014you\u2019ll see that the cream will start out light and foamy, then the bubbles will get bigger, and then, as the cream is getting closer to 180\u00b0F, it will start to thicken and the whisk will leave tracks. Heads up at this point\u2014the tracks mean the cream is almost ready. Don\u2019t stop whisking and don\u2019t stop checking the temperature. And have patience\u2014depending on how much heat you\u2019re giving the cream, getting to temp can take as long as 10 minutes.\nAs soon as you reach 180\u00b0F, pull the cream from the heat and strain it into the container of a blender (or food processor); discard the zest. Let the cream rest at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until it cools to 140\u00b0F, about 10 minutes.\nTurn the blender to high and, with the machine going, add about 5 pieces of butter at a time. Scrape down the sides of the container as needed while you\u2019re incorporating the butter. Once the butter is in, keep the machine going\u2014to get the perfect light, airy texture of lemon-cream dreams, you must continue to beat the cream for another 3 minutes. If your machine protests and gets a bit too hot, work in 1-minute intervals, giving the machine a little rest between beats.\nPour the cream into a container, press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface to create an airtight seal and chill the cream for at least 4 hours or overnight. When you are ready to construct the tart, just whisk the cream to loosen it and spoon it into the tart shell.\nServing:\nThe tart should be served cold, because it is a particular pleasure to have the cold cream melt in your mouth.\nStoring:\nWhile you can make the lemon cream ahead (it will keep in the frige for 4 days and in the freezer for up to 2 months), once the tart is constructed, it\u2019s best to eat it the day it is made.\nDesserts\nPastries\nLemon",
