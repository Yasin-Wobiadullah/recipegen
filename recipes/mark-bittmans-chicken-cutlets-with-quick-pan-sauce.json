Put the flour on a plate or in a shallow bowl next to the stove. If necessary, put each cutlet between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to uniform thickness; blot the chicken dry with a paper towel and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nPut the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, turn a piece of the chicken in the flour to coat it on all sides; shake off any excess. Add the floured chicken to the pan, then repeat with the next piece; work in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan.\nCook, adjusting the heat as needed so that the fat is always bubbling but the chicken doesn\u2019t burn. After 2 minutes, rotate the chicken so that the outside edges are moved toward the center and vice versa (don\u2019t flip them; you want the same side in contact with the fat). When the bottom of each piece is brown, after 3 to 4 minutes, turn them over.\nCook on the second side, adjusting the heat as described in Step 3, until the chicken is firm to the touch but still a bit pink inside, another 3 to 4 minutes. To check for doneness, cut into a piece with a thin-bladed knife and take a peek. Transfer the chicken to an ovenproof platter and put it in the oven.\nAdd the wine to the skillet, keeping the heat at medium-high. Let it bubble away as you stir and scrape the bottom of the pan, until about half the wine has evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the water and continue to stir until the liquid has thickened slightly and reduced to 1/4 cup, another 2 or 3 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the skillet and swirl the pan around until the butter melts; turn off the heat.\nRemove the chicken from the oven, and if any juices have accumulated on the platter, add them to the skillet along with the 1/4 cup parsley. Stir, taste the sauce, and adjust the seasoning. Spoon the sauce over the chicken, garnish with the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and serve with the lemon quarters.\nRead More\nChicken Piccata (Fried Chicken Cutlets With Lemon-Butter Pan Sauce)\nEasy Pan-Roasted Chicken Breasts With White Wine and Fines Herbes Pan Sauce Recipe\n29 Chicken Breast Recipes to Make You Like White Meat\nChicken Breast\nRoasted Chicken\nChicken Mains\nQuick Dinners",
