Grease and flour a loaf pan; set aside. Place flour, sugar, oats, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium mixing bowl and stir to thoroughly combine. Set aside.\nPlace bananas, eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla in a blender and blend on medium speed for 15-10 seconds, until bananas are completely pur\u00e9ed. Don't blend too high, you don't want to incorporate a lot of air. Pour wet mixture into dry and fold just to incorporate. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake for 30 minutes, then turn the pan and bake for another 25 to 30 minutes, until a skewer or paring knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from oven and immediately run a paring knife around the edges of the loaf, then turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Once cooled, loaf can be tightly wrapped and stored in refrigerator for 3-5 days or frozen for up to a month.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nloaf pan\n,\nmixing bowl\n,\nspatula\nNotes\nMake sure your bananas are at least very ripe, or overripe. You can even use frozen bananas, if you allow them to thaw and come to room temperature first (cold bananas will make the batter cold and the bread will take longer to bake).\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTightly wrapped, the bread can be refrigerated for 3-5 days or frozen for up to 1 month.\nRead More\nQuick-Ripen Bananas for Baking Using the Power of Enzymes\nClassic Banana Bread\nBanana Bread Ice Cream\nBreakfast & Brunch\nQuick Breads\nBanana\nMother's Day",
