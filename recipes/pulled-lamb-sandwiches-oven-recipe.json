In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, salt, garam masala, paprika, turmeric, ground ginger, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper. If lamb is tied up, remove twine and unfurl on a work surface. Season lamb all over with 2 to 3 tablespoons spice mixture, making sure to rub it on all sides. Reserve remaining spice mixture.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing butcher's twine, tie up lamb shoulder into an even cylinder.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together ketchup, tomato paste, Worcestershire, Dijon, molasses, cider vinegar, liquid smoke, hot sauce, and fish sauce. Stir in 1/4 cup of reserved spice mixture. Season with salt, if necessary.\nHeat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add lamb and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 5 minutes total. (Lamb will brown fast because of the sugar; do not let it burn.) Add onion and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until softened, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd half of sauce mixture and chicken stock to Dutch oven, stirring to blend; reserve remaining sauce. Cover, transfer to oven, and cook until lamb is just starting to turn tender, about 2 hours. Remove lid and continue cooking until a knife or fork shows very little resistance when twisted inside the meat and a dark bark has formed, about 1 hour longer; add a small dose of water if at any point the pot goes dry during the last hour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, for the Slaw:\nIn a large bowl, combine cabbage, carrot, parsley, cider vinegar, mayonnaise, caraway, and mustard seeds, tossing to combine thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper.\nTransfer lamb to a large bowl, reserving liquid in pot. Using a ladle, skim off excess fat from liquid and discard. Add reserved sauce to pot and whisk to combine. When lamb is cool enough to handle, shred with two forks.\nLadle sauce into lamb, tossing until meat is nicely coated; you may not need to add all the sauce. Season to taste with more salt, sugar, liquid smoke, or cider vinegar, as desired.\nPile pulled lamb onto the bottom half of each bun. If you have extra sauce, you can ladle some onto each pile of lamb; you can also lightly sprinkle with any remaining spice rub. Top with slaw, close buns, and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nbox grater\n, butcher's twine\nRead More\nSmoked Lamb Barbacoa Recipe\nBraised Lamb Shoulder With Dried Chilies and Dates Recipe\nSichuan Roast Leg of Lamb With Celery-Mint Salad Recipe\nEasy Oven-Cooked Pulled Pork Recipe\nLamb Shoulder\nDairy-free Mains\nBraised & Stewed Lamb\nLamb Mains\nSandwiches",
