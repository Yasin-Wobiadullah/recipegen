In a medium bowl, thoroughly combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, and tapioca; set aside.\nFor the Shortbread:\n: Grease 9- by 9-inch baking pan with butter. Place flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and pulse three times to combine. Add cold diced butter and pulse until it is the size of peas. Add milk and pulse just until the mixture comes together; the crumbs should look like wet sand and hold together when you pinch them between your forefinger and thumb. Press dough evenly into bottom of prepared baking pan.\nFor the Crumb Topping:\n: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add softened butter and, using a pastry cutter or your hands, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until large crumbs form.\nSpread jam evenly over shortbread in baking pan, then pour in prepared fruit mixture and spread in an even layer. Top with crumb mixture. Bake until crumbs are golden and fruit is bubbling, 45 to 55 minutes. Let cool completely then cut into rectangles or, if desired, squares.\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 9-inch cake pan, food processor\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSummer Dessert Mashup: How to Make Blueberry Crumble Bars\nDessert Bars\nBaking\nBlueberry"
