(Set it to medium if it has temperature controls.)\nOn a plate, mix flour with paprika or cayenne. Place eggs in a second plate or bowl and bread crumbs in a third. Working one slice at a time, coat cheese in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.\nSpray both sides of waffle iron with nonstick spray, place as many cheese slices as will fit in waffle iron, and close lid. Cook until bread crumbs turn golden brown, about 1 minute. Repeat with any remaining cheese.\nServe hot on its own or with salsa for dipping.\nSpecial Equipment\nWaffle iron\nNotes\nAny good melting cheese such as young provolone, fontina, Jack, cheddar, or a queso chihuahua can be used in place of the mozzarella. Avoid fresh mozzarella or dry cheese meant for grating. Some recipes call for the breaded cheese to be refrigerated (or frozen) before cooking. I did not find this to be necessary with the waffle iron version, but you can certainly bread the cheese several hours ahead and refrigerate it until you're ready to waffle.\nRead More\nMozzarella-Stuffed Crispy Baked Onion Rings\nGluten-Free Mozzarella Sticks\nGrilled Brazilian Cheese Skewers (Espetinhos de Queijo de Coalho)\nTeque\u00f1os (Venezuelan Cheese Sticks)\nBu\u00f1uelos de Yuca y Queso (Yuca and Cheese Fritters) Recipe\nSnacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nMozzarella\nGame Day"
