  "full_text": "Pommes de Terre Fondantes (Fondant Potatoes)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nTotal\n45 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2\ncups\nhomemade\nchicken\nor\nbeef\nstock\n, or\nstore-bought low-sodium chicken broth\n, plus extra as needed\n1/4\nounce\n(\n2 1/2\nteaspoons\n;\n1\npacket\n;\n7\ng\n)\nunflavored gelatin\n, such as Knox\n2 1/2\npounds\n(\n1.1\nkg\n)\nYukon Gold potatoes\n, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long each, peeled\nKosher salt\nand\nfreshly ground black pepper\n2\ntablespoons\n(\n30\nml\n)\nvegetable oil\n,\nbeef fat\n,\nschmaltz\n, or\nduck fat\n(see note)\n4\ntablespoons\n(\n55\ng\n)\nunsalted butter\n3\nmedium\ngarlic cloves\n(\n15\ng\n), peeled and smashed\n1\ntablespoon\nfresh thyme\u00a0leaves\n, chopped\nFlaky sea salt\n, such as\nMaldon\n, for finishing (optional)\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Place stock in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top. Set aside.\nVicky Wasik\nUsing a sharp knife, cut off ends of potatoes to give them flat sides, then halve potatoes crosswise. Pat dry with paper towels.\nVicky Wasik\nIn a 12-inch stainless steel straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan or skillet, or cast iron skillet, heat oil or fat over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Season potatoes with salt and pepper and add to skillet, broad side down, in a single layer with space between each piece. Cook, without moving, until potatoes begin to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, rotating and swirling pan gently to promote even browning and prevent sticking, until potatoes are deeply browned on bottom side, 3 to 4 minutes longer, adjusting heat as needed if some of the pieces brown too quickly.\nVicky Wasik\nUsing a thin metal spatula, flip potatoes onto second flat side. Add butter and cook, swirling constantly, until butter is melted and begins to foam, about 1 minute. Add garlic and thyme, and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add stock and bring to a boil.\nVicky Wasik\nTransfer skillet to oven and roast until potatoes are completely tender, offering little to no resistance when poked with a paring knife, and liquid is reduced to a saucy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nReturn skillet to stovetop. Using a thin metal spatula or tongs, transfer potatoes to a serving platter, broad side up, leaving sauce in the skillet; discard garlic. Bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook, swirling and stirring constantly, until sauce is emulsified, 30 seconds to 1 minute. If emulsion appears broken or sauce is too thick, add more stock or water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper and pour sauce over and around potatoes. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt (if using, otherwise season with a little more kosher salt), and serve.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch straight-sided\nsaut\u00e9 pan\nor\ncast iron skillet\n.\nNotes\nIf you happen to have any schmaltz, rendered beef, or duck fat available, we recommend using it for browning the potatoes in place of vegetable oil in step 3.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately, but leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat with additional stock, up to 1/4 cup (60ml), to loosen and then re-emulsify the sauce.\nPotatoes\nVegetable Sides\nFrench\nBraised & Stewed Vegetables\nThe Latest",
