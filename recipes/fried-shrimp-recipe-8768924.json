In another large shallow bowl, whisk buttermilk, eggs, and 1/2 cup of flour mixture to combine.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSet a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet; set aside. Using paper towels, pat shrimp dry. Add to buttermilk mixture and toss to evenly coat. Working with 2 to 3 shrimp at a time, let excess buttermilk mixture drip off. Dredge shrimp in flour mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Shake off excess flour and transfer shrimp to prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until most of the exterior flour mixture has slightly hydrated, 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nLine another rimmed baking sheet with 2 layers of paper towels; set aside. Fill a large Dutch oven with 1 1/2 inches peanut oil and heat over medium-high heat until 365\u00baF (185\u00baC). Carefully add about 1/3 of shrimp to oil. Fry, using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon to gently stir, until golden brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer shrimp to paper towel-lined baking sheet with a slotted spoon; allow oil to return 365\u00b0F (185\u00baC), and repeat with remaining shrimp in 2 more bat. Serve with remoulade, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nTwo 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheets, large Dutch oven, spider skimmer or slotted spoon\nNotes\nTo make your own self-rising flour: whisk together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of Diamond Crystal kosher salt (for table salt, use half as much by volume).\nCorn flour is very finely ground flour milled from whole corn kernels. Bob\u2019s Red Mill is one good brand of corn flour available at many grocery stores. If you can't find it, you can swap the corn flour for an equal amount of self-rising flour.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nFried shrimp is best eaten immediately, but if you have leftovers they can be safely stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nR\u00e9moulade can be refrigerated for up to 5 days.\nShrimp\nThe Latest\nSoul Food & Southern\nFried Seafood\nCajun & Creole"
