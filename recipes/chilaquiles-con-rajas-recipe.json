Combine onion, jalape\u00f1o, tomatillos, garlic, and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large bowl. Season with kosher salt and toss to combine. Transfer vegetables to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil until completely tender and charred in spots, rotating once or twice during broiling, 10 to 15 minutes total.\nTransfer vegetables to a blender, add cilantro and half of the pepper strips. Blend until smooth (be careful, hot contents can blow the lid off the blender. Start with the slowest speed and slowly build up). Season to taste with salt, then transfer salsa to a wide saucepan. Add 1/2 cup water and remaining pepper strips.\nHeat 2 quarts oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 375\u00b0F (use an instant-read thermometer). Fry tortillas in two batches, agitating and flipping during frying with a wire-mesh spider. Fry until pale golden brown and completely crisp, about 2 minutes. Lift chips, allow excess oil to drain, and transfer directly to saucepan with sauce.\nAfter all chips have been added, fold sauce and chips together with a large spoon or spatula. Cover pot and allow to rest for 1 to 2 minutes, depending on how soft you like your chips. Serve immediately, garnished with your choice of toppings.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge wok or dutch oven for frying\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHangover Helper: Chilaquiles con Rajas\nBreakfast & Brunch\nMexican\nEggs"
