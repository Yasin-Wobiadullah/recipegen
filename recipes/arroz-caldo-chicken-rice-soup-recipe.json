Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic turns light golden brown. Transfer garlic to fine-mesh strainer and drain. Spread garlic out on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Hom\nIn a large Dutch oven or soup pot, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 6 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring and scraping, until onion softens and releases its liquid, about 3 minutes. Stir in ginger and remaining garlic and cook until onion begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in fish sauce and pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add rice and stir until well coated.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Hom\nStir in chicken stock, running spoon along bottom of Dutch oven to release any browned bits. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until rice is completely tender and stock has thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in lime or calamansi juice and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Hom\nLadle arroz caldo into bowls. Top with scallions, fried garlic, and egg slices, if using. Serve immediately with additional lime or calamansi wedges on the side.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Hom\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nor\nsoup pot\nNotes\nWhile we prefer this dish with tender chicken thighs, you can substitute an equal quantity of breast meat.\nCalamansi, a very sour citrus fruit, is typical in Filipino cooking, but can be hard to find fresh. Fresh lime or key lime works well in its place.\nRead More\nFilipino Food 101: Recipes to Get You Started\nArroz Aguado (Nicaraguan Chicken and Rice Stew)\nGround Pork and Corn Congee (Chinese Rice Porridge)\nBengali Rice Porridge With Lentils and Chicken\nKorean Chicken and Rice Porridge (Dak Juk)\nClassic Chicken and Rice Soup\nFilipino\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nRice & Grains\nChicken Mains\nComfort Food",
