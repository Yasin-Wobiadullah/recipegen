Set aside and either transfer to a reusable spice bag or add loose to cider.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nCover and let cider mull on high (reduce if it begins to bubble) for about 4 hours, or until spice flavor is well infused. Ten minutes before serving, add brandy. Add sugar, 1 rounded teaspoon at a time, if cider is too tart (sugar will bring out flavor of spices if needed).\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nServe plain, or with a slice of lemon, extra brandy, or a small grating of nutmeg. If keeping warm for service, remove spices.\nSpecial Equipment\nSlow cooker\n, small muslin spice bag (both optional)\nNotes\nCiders can vary greatly in sweetness and acidity. Adjust the final seasoning of the mulled cider with a spoonful of alcohol to enhance the fruity aromas, raw sugar to bring out the spice, and/or lemon to balance the sweetness. We recommend cider-friendly liquors, such as brandy, bourbon, or dark rum.\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nChristmas\nSlow Cooker\nApple\nFall Drinks"
