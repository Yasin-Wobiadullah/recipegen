Lightly coat all chicken parts with oil and arrange in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet or in a roasting pan. Roast, turning bones once or twice, until beginning to turn golden brown, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Liz Clayman\nMeanwhile, lightly toss onion, carrot, and celery in oil. When step 1 is complete, scatter all over and around bones and continue roasting until bones and vegetables are nicely browned, about 30 minutes longer. Be careful not to let anything scorch.\nTransfer chicken parts and roasted vegetables to a pressure cooker. Pour off and discard (or save) any accumulated fat from the roasting pan. Pour a thin layer of boiling water into roasting pan and scrape up any browned bits. Pour pan juices into pressure cooker.\nAdd garlic, thyme, parsley, and tomato paste to pressure cooker. Add enough cold water to bring level to the cooker's max-fill line; do not let water exceed the max-fill line, even if some solids are not submerged.\nClose pressure cooker, bring to high pressure, and cook for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Allow cooker to depressurize naturally. Open cooker and strain stock through a fine-mesh strainer; discard solids.\nSkim stock by either carefully ladling off top layer of fat while stock is still hot, or, for greater ease, refrigerate stock until well-chilled, then remove the solid cap of fat that lies on top.\nPortion stock into storage containers or\nzipper-lock bags\n(if it's been chilled, reheat it to a liquid state first), then freeze or refrigerate until ready to use.\nSpecial Equipment\nPressure cooker\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nUse any combination of reserved chicken backs, wings, necks, as well as carcasses saved from prior meals. Chicken feet are great to add to the mix, too, since they will deliver the biggest dose of gelatin to the stock, improving its body and sauce-making qualities.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nChicken stock can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to a week, or frozen for up to 6 months.\nRead More\nStovetop Chicken Chintan Stock\nThe Ultimate Chicken Noodle Soup\nChicken\nPressure Cooked Chicken"
