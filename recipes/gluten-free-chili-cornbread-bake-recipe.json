In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and oil.\nTo make the filling with meat.\nIn a large nonstick frying pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering but not smoking. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the onion is soft and tender, about three minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is soft and aromatic, about one minute. Add the ground turkey or beef and cook, breaking up the clumps with the wooden spoon, until thoroughly cooked and browned. If desired, remove and discard any excess fat. Add three cups of chili. Stir until combined and cook until it begins to bubble. The mixture should be loose but not watery. Add an additional 1/4 cup water if it seems dry. Continue to step four.\nTo make the filling without meat.\nPlace six cups of chili in a medium pot and heat over medium heat. Stir frequently until chili gently bubbles. The chili should be loose but not watery. Add an additional 1/4 cup water if it seems thick.\nPour the chili filling into the prepared pan. If desired, sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top. Finish the cornbread topping: Pour the egg mixture into the cornmeal mixture. Stir with a fork to combine. Pour the batter evenly over the cheese. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread batter evenly.\nBake the casserole for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cornbread topping is light golden brown and no longer jiggles. A tester inserted into the middle of the cornbread should come out dry. Serve hot. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. This casserole can be frozen.\nBeef Mains\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nSavory\nBeans\nCornmeal",
