  "full_text": "Seared Duck Breast With Prosciutto, Sage, and Peaches Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n35 mins\nActive\n45 mins\nResting Time\n5 mins\nTotal\n50 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nduck breasts\n, 4 to 5 ounces (112 to 140 g) each\nKosher salt\n8\nlarge\n, thin slices\nprosciutto\n(about\n1/4\npound\n;\n115\ng\n), divided\n1/2\npound\n(\n225\ng\n)\nfrozen peach slices\n, defrosted\n1\nbunch\nfresh sage\n(about\n1/4\nounce\n;\n7\ng\n), leaves picked\nDirections\nWith a sharp knife, gently score duck skin in a tight crosshatch pattern, keeping the scores 1/8 inch apart. If you prefer a little fat left on the breasts after cooking, just barely score the skin; to render more fat, score more deeply, taking care not to expose the flesh.\nSeason duck breasts with salt, heavily on the skin side and lightly on the flesh side.\nPlace duck breasts, skin side down, in a large, cold saut\u00e9 pan. Place pan over low to medium-low heat. To keep the edges from curling up, press duck breasts down with the help of a smaller saut\u00e9 pan or weight. After about 5 minutes, the fat should begin to gently bubble. If the fat is either silent or spitting, adjust heat accordingly. Maintain the gentle bubble of fat, pouring out excess rendered fat into a heatproof bowl throughout the cooking process, until much of the fat has rendered, skin is golden brown, and duck's internal temperature is 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C), about 15 minutes; reserve rendered fat.\nIncrease heat to medium to further brown skin if needed, about 1 minute. Flip breasts flesh side down. For medium-rare meat, cook until breast registers 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 to 2 minutes. Continue cooking until duck registers 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) for medium or 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0F) for well-done. Remove duck from pan and set aside to rest for 5 minutes.\nPour off (or add reserved fat) such that you have about 2 tablespoons in the pan. Return pan to medium-high heat. Working in batches if necessary, cook half the prosciutto, turning, until crispy, about 2 minutes (the prosciutto may not fully crisp in the pan, but it will as it cools). Transfer to paper towels to drain.\nSeason peach slices lightly with salt. Add peach slices to the skillet and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula, transfer peaches to a platter.\nAdd all of the reserved duck fat to the skillet and heat over medium high heat until shimmering. Add sage leaves and cook, gently swirling, until bubbling slows down and leaves are frizzled. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to paper towels to drain.\nUsing a sharp knife, slice duck breasts crosswise. Arrange on plates, alternating the duck slices with pieces of the reserved uncooked prosciutto (tear or cut the prosciutto so that each piece is about the same size as the duck breast slice). Pile some of the seared peaches on each plate. Crumble the crispy prosciutto and frizzled sage all over and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nSaut\u00e9 pan\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBeer Pairings 101: Sour, Tart, and Funky Beers\nDuck Mains\nStovetop\nDuck\nPeach\nSage",
