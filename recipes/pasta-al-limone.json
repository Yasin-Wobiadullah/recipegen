Lower heat to low, add lemon zest and garlic, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in a medium pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until just shy of al dente. Reserve about 1 cup (240ml) of the starchy pasta water, then drain pasta.\nAdd pasta to butter mixture, along with 1/2 cup (120ml) reserved pasta water. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring and tossing to coat, until pasta is glazed in a satiny, emulsified sauce.\nAdd grated cheese and toss and stir rapidly until sauce thickens; if it becomes too tight and dry at any time, add more pasta-cooking water to loosen it sufficiently. Add lemon juice to taste, starting with 1 tablespoon (15ml), then adding more until desired tartness is reached. Season with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe spaghetti right away, topping each serving with additional grated lemon zest and cheese.\nSpecial Equipment\nMicroplane grater\nRead More\nRoman-Style Fettuccine With Alfredo Sauce\nLemony Pasta With Asparagus and Bacon\nPasta Burro e Alici (Pasta With Creamy Anchovy-Butter Sauce)\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nLemon\nCreamy Pastas\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine",
