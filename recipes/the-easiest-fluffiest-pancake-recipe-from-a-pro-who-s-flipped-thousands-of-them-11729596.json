In a medium bowl, whisk eggs, oil, milk and vanilla (if using) until well combined. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture and with a whisk, stir gently until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with a few streaks of flour). Let batter sit for 10 to 15 minutes before cooking.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon oil over medium-low heat until shimmering, 5 minutes. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out excess oil, leaving thin film on bottom and sides of skillet.\nTo Test Temperature of Skillet:\nDrop 1 tablespoon batter in center of skillet. If pancake is pale golden brown after 1 minute, skillet is ready. If it is too light or too dark, adjust heat accordingly.\nUsing 1/4-cup dry measuring cup or ice cream scoop, portion batter into skillet in 3 places, leaving even spacing between portions. Use the back of a measuring cup or a spoon to gently spread batter into a 4-inch round. Cook until bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, edges are set, and bottom sides are golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes.\nUsing a thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until the second sides are golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and serve. (Alternatively transfer cooked pancakes to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and hold warm in a 200\u2109; 93\u2103 oven until ready to serve.) Repeat with remaining batter, using additional oil as needed.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch nonstick skillet or a well-seasoned cast iron or carbon steel skillet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTo store leftover pancakes, separate them with paper or foil between each pancake before wrapping tightly in plastic wrap or storing in a zipper-lock freezer bag and freeze up to 3 weeks.\nPancakes\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nBreakfast & Brunch"
