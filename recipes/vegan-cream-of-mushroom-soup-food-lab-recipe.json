Set aside.\nHeat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add leeks, onions, and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add button mushrooms and 8 ounces of shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until excess liquid evaporates and mushrooms start to sizzle, about 10 minutes.\nAdd flour and stir to incorporate. Cook for 30 seconds. Add sherry or white wine and cook, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of pan, until thick and syrupy, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce and miso and stir to incorporate. Add broth and soaked mushrooms. Add bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Bring soup to a simmer and adjust heat to maintain a bare bubble. Let simmer for 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, make the shiitake chips. Combine remaining sliced shiitake mushrooms with the vegetable oil in a medium non-stick skillet. Heat over medium-low heat and cook, flipping mushrooms and stirring frequently, until dehydrated and well-browned. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spatula and season immediately with salt. Let cool.\nAdd torn bread slices to soup and soak for 30 seconds. Discard bay leaves and thyme and transfer soup to a blender. Close blender and blend, starting on low speed and slowly getting faster. Once blender is at full speed, slowly drizzle in remaining olive oil. Continue blending until completely smooth. Rinse out pot and pour soup back into it through a chinois or fine mesh strainer. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nServe soup topped with crispy shiitake mushrooms, scallions, and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil\nSpecial equipment\nBlender\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: Vegan Cream of Mushroom Soup With Crispy Shiitake Chips\nDairy-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop\nCremini & Button Mushrooms",
