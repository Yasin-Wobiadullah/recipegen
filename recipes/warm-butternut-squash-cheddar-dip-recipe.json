Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Grease a casserole dish with olive oil and set aside.\nPeel, seed, and dice the squash into 1-inch cubes, using\nthis guide\n. Alternatively, use the microwave: Poke holes all over the squash with a fork or make shallow slits in the skin with a knife. Microwave squash for 3 minutes or until the skin and flesh have softened slightly. Peel squash and cut into cubes. Discard seeds.\nPlace squash cubes on prepared baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Toss to coat. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nRoast squash until fork-tender and lightly browned, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, melt butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add sage leaves and fry in butter until lightly crisped and beginning to darken slightly. Remove pan from heat and remove sage leaves using a slotted spoon. Set aside.\nReturn pan to heat, add onion, and season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until onion has caramelized, about 30 minutes. Add more butter if onion begins to stick to pan. Stir in garlic at the very end and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nPlace roasted squash, caramelized onion mixture, and about 2/3 of the crispy sage leaves into the bowl of a food processor. Process until well combined. Add cream cheese and sour cream and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary.\nTransfer squash mixture to prepared casserole dish and mix in half of the cheddar cheese throughout. Top with remaining half of cheese.\nBake dip at 400\u00b0F until cheese is entirely melted and browned in spots, about 20 minutes. Top with remaining crispy sage leaves and serve warm with pita chips or crackers for dipping.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\ncasserole dish\n,\nfood processor\nNotes\nThe dip can be covered and refrigerated for up to three days before baking and serving.\nDips\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nRoasted Vegetables\nCheddar Cheese\nButternut Squash",
