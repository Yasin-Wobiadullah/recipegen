Season with salt and pepper and stir until thoroughly combined.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nGently fold in remaining half of crabmeat until just combined; try not to break apart the lumps of meat any more than necessary as you stir.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIf pan-frying, form crab mixture into patties and arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet. In a large cast iron or nonstick skillet, heat oil (and/or butter) over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add patties and cook, rotating and flipping occasionally for even browning, until browned and crispy on both sides, about 10 minutes. Lower heat at any point to prevent burning, and add more oil or butter as needed if pan goes dry.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIf broiling, line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and preheat broiler. Form the crab mixture into handball-size balls and mound on the prepared baking sheet. Broil about 5 inches from the broiler element until well browned on top and heated through, about 4 minutes.\nServe right away with lemon wedges and tartar sauce, if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet\nor\nnonstick skillet\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nRead More\nMaryland Crab Imperial With Buttery Golden Bread Crumbs\nMaryland Crab Feast\nThai Shrimp Cakes with Sweet Chili Sauce",
