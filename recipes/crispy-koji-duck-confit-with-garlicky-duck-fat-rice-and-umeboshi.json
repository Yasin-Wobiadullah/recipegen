Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon (5ml) duck fat to skillet, and spread with a paper towel until no visible fat remains. Add duck legs to skillet, skin-side down, and cook, using a weight or small cast iron skillet to press down on the duck legs for even browning and crisping of the skin. Cook, checking and shifting duck legs occasionally to ensure even browning of the skin, until skin is deeply browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully flip duck legs over, and continue to cook until meat is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer duck legs to a plate or rimmed baking sheet.\nMeanwhile, heat remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) duck fat in a small saucepan or skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic softens, becomes very aromatic, and turns lightly golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pour contents of saucepan over the cooked rice, and, using a rice paddle or rubber spatula, stir to incorporate garlic and evenly coat rice with duck fat. Add umeboshi, cilantro, and sesame seeds to rice, and stir to combine. Season with salt to taste.\nDivide rice evenly between serving bowls, followed by duck legs. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nNonstick skillet,\nChef's Press cooking weights\n(optional)\nNotes\nThis recipe was developed using Japanese short-grain rice, but other types of rice will work as well.\nUmeboshi are salted, fermented Japanese plums that pack an intense sweet-sour-salty punch. They can be found in well-stocked grocery stores, Japanese markets, and online.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBreak Out Your Nonstick Skillet for the Best Crispy Duck Leg Confit\nDuck Mains\nDuck\nStovetop\nPoultry Fats\nWhite Rice",
