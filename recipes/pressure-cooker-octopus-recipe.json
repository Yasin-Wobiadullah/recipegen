(Be sure to keep water level below pressure cooker's maximum fill line.) Add a couple of large pinches of salt. Close pressure cooker and bring to high pressure (12 to 15 psi). Once cooker has reached high pressure, cook for 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing steam-release valve, depressurize cooker rapidly. Check octopus for tenderness by sliding a paring knife into the thickest part of one of its tentacles; it should slide in easily with little resistance. If the octopus is not tender enough, return to high pressure and then cook for 5 minutes longer. (Fifteen minutes was the correct time based on all our tests, but variations in the octopus, such as size, and in the pressure cooker used may change the cooking time slightly.)\nLet octopus cool in its cooking liquid, then drain. Cooked octopus can be refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 2 days before use.\nTo use cooked octopus, cut out and discard the hard beak (if it hasn't been removed already by the fishmonger), which is found in the center of the base of the octopus body, where the tentacles converge. Cut out and discard the section of the head with eyes; the rest of the head is edible. Separate tentacles into individual pieces.\nTo Serve Cold:\nCut tentacles and head into pieces and add to a seafood salad or ceviche.\nTo Sear:\nLeave tentacles whole (or, if very long, cut into manageable sections); cut head meat into large pieces. Heat a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add octopus pieces and cook until well browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Turn and brown on other side, about 3 minutes longer. Season with salt and serve as desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric or stovetop pressure cooker\nMake Ahead and Storage\nPressure-cooked octopus can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days.\nRead More\nGrilled Octopus With Chili-Herb Oil\nClassic Pulpo Gallego (Galician Octopus Tapa)\nOctopus Poke With Kimchi\nOctopus\nPressure Cooker\nSeafood Mains"
