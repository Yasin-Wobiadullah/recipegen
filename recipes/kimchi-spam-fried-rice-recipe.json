Place kimchi in a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl and squeeze out excess liquid. Reserve liquid and finely chop kimchi.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nHeat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a wok over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add Spam and cook, tossing and stirring frequently, until well browned and starting to crisp. Add chopped kimchi and onion and cook, stirring and tossing regularly, until vegetables are softened, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd another 1/2 tablespoon oil to wok. Increase heat to high and heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until rice is pale brown, toasted, and has a slightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice.\nReturn all rice to wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add another 1/2 tablespoon oil to the space. Add scallions (reserving some for garnish), garlic, and chile. Stir gently and cook until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss with rice to combine. Add onion, kimchi, and Spam mixture and toss to combine. Pour in reserved kimchi juice and season generously with black pepper. Add fish sauce, sesame oil, and cilantro (reserving some cilantro for garnish). Toss everything to combine. Season to taste with salt if necessary. When ready to serve, allow rice to sit in wok without tossing for 45 seconds to create a crisp crust underneath.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTurn rice out onto a serving platter, trying to get as much of the crispy rice facing up as possible. Top with fried eggs, sprinkle with reserved scallions and cilantro, and serve immediately with hot sauce.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nNotes\nFor best results, use Chinese-style medium-grain rice, jasmine rice, or sushi rice. Rice should either be cooked fresh, spread on a tray, and allowed to cool for 5 minutes, or transferred to a loosely covered container and refrigerated for at least 12 hours and up to three days.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n,\ncarbon steel skillet\nor\nwok\nRead More\nEasy Fried Rice\nSpam Hacks: 12+ Things to Do with SPAM\nRice & Grain Mains\nKorean\nPork\nWhite Rice\nQuick Dinners"
