Blend at high speed, stopping to scrape down sides if necessary, until a very smooth, silky sauce forms. Season with salt. Add 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil and blend in at low speed just until emulsified.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until browned, about 6 minutes.\nIn a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until just al dente. Transfer pasta to pan with mushrooms, reserving pasta-cooking water. Pour on just enough creamy sauce to coat all the pasta, then add about 1/4 cup (60ml) pasta-cooking water. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until sauce forms a silky glaze that coats pasta. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nlarge saut\u00e9 pan\nNotes\nUse the brine from good-quality fermented sauerkraut\u2014it should be nice and sour. You can also\nmake your own kraut at home\nand use some of the brine from that. The sauerkraut brine adds the lactic acid that the cheese would normally contribute to the dish, but in a pinch, you could substitute 1/4 cup (60ml) each of water and dry white wine.\nRead More\nPasta With Vegan Chickpea Sauce\nPasta With Rich and Hearty Mushroom Bolognese Recipe\nRecipes By Diet\nVegan\nItalian\nVegan Mains\nTofu",
