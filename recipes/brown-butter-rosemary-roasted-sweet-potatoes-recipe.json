Heat water to 160\u00b0F (70\u00b0C) as registered on an instant-read thermometer. Cover and set aside for 1 hour.\nAdjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Drain sweet potatoes and transfer to a large bowl. Toss with oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread sweet potatoes on 2 rimmed baking sheets and roast until bottom sides are browned, about 30 minutes. Carefully flip potatoes with a thin spatula and roast until second side is browned and potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes longer.\nMeanwhile, in a small container, sprinkle gelatin over chicken stock and let bloom for 5 minutes. Microwave until gelatin is dissolved, stopping and stirring as needed to help it dissolve, about 2 minutes.\nIn a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foamy. Continue to cook, swirling pan, until milk solids in butter turn a deep hazelnut brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add rosemary (don't be alarmed; butter will foam and fizzle when rosemary is added), swirling to coat.\nAdd chicken stock to butter, return to medium heat, and bring to a simmer. Cook, swirling, until stock reduces slightly and sauce becomes rich and silky, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, discard rosemary, and add lemon juice. Season with salt.\nIn a mixing bowl, toss potatoes with butter sauce and serve. Potatoes can be made in advance, tossed with sauce, and set aside until ready to serve; rewarm in the oven before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheets\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nThe Best Roasted Sweet Potatoes\nMiso-Scallion Roasted Sweet Potatoes\nSmoky Spiced-Pecan Roasted Sweet Potatoes\nThe Best Way to Cook Whole Sweet Potatoes\nA Field Guide to Sweet Potato Types (and the Dirt on Yams)\nSweet Potatoes\nGluten-free Sides\nRoasted Potatoes\nThanksgiving Side Dishes"
