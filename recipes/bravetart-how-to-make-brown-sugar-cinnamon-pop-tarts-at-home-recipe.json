Add corn syrup all at once and mix with a fork until it forms a ball. Dust your hands with a little flour, scoop out the dough, and knead lightly until smooth. Flatten dough into a squarish shape, wrap in plastic, and chill at least 30 minutes.\nPrepare the Filling:\nPut the breadcrumbs in a bowl, then drizzle with melted butter. Toss with a fork to coat. Add the remaining filling ingredients and mash together with a fork to make a paste.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and have a parchment-lined sheet pan ready. Roll the dough to a little shy of a 1/4-inch thick. This is important. Each Pop-Tart will ultimately have 4 \u201clayers\u201d (pastry + filling + pastry + icing), so pay close attention to the thickness of each. If you don\u2019t, you may wind up with massively thick Pop-Tarts.\nTake the chilled squarish lump of dough and set it onto a surface dusted in sifted powdered sugar. Roll the dough evenly both left-and-right and up-and-down, but don\u2019t roll diagonally! This will preserve the square shape and minimize re-rolling. Lift and move the dough periodically to make certain it hasn\u2019t stuck, dusting underneath as needed. (If you discover a patch is stuck, slide an offset metal spatula between the dough and the counter to loosen. Pull back the dough and dust the patch with powdered sugar.)\nOnce the dough has reached about a 1/4\u201d thickness and an overall square shape, use a ruler to cut it into a series of 3 1/8\u201d wide strips. Cut each strip at 4-inch intervals. Gather up any remaining scraps, roll, and cut likewise until you have 24 pieces all together.\nOn half of the pieces, place about a tablespoon of prepared filling. Use your fingers to scatter the filling into a rectangular shape, leaving a 1/4\" margin all around the edges.\nSeal and Bake the Tarts:\nCover each filled tart with a plain dough piece. Use your fingers or the heel of a bench knife to smooth the dough over the filling and to gently press out any air pockets.\nUse the handle of a bench knife, the handle of a wooden spoon, or the side of your hand to gently seal the dough along all four sides of each tart. Do not use a fork to crimp the edges; have you ever seen a Pop Tart before? No crimping.\nOnce you\u2019ve smoothly sealed the edges of the Pop-Tart, carefully prick the surface with a fork.\nUse a bench knife or spatula to transfer the Pop-Tarts to the parchment-lined sheet pan. Bake for about 20 minutes, until barely beginning to take on some color. You don\u2019t want them \u201cgolden brown\u201d by any means, real Pop-Tarts look downright anemic (and, in fact the one pictured at the top is slightly overdone).\nOccasionally, a Pop-Tart or two will spread somewhat irregularly during baking. While they\u2019re still warm from the oven, you can trim the edges quite easily with a bench scraper, knife or pizza cutter. Cool thoroughly.\nSerious Eats / Sarah Jane Sanders\nMake the Frosting and Finish the Tarts:\nUse a clean towel or dry pastry brush to dust off the cooled Pop-Tarts, removing any stray crumbs.\nCombine all of the icing ingredients in a bowl and mix until a smooth paste forms. Put some of the icing into a piping bag fitted with a small, plain tip. Pipe a boarder of icing around the perimeter of each tart, leaving about a 1/4\u201d margin.\nThin the remaining icing, a tablespoon of water at a time, until it reaches a pourable consistency. Pour a tablespoon of icing onto each tart and use the tip of a metal spatula or spoon to help it reach all of the corners. Pop-Tarts only have a thin smear of icing on top, so take care not to overdo it.\nAge the Pop-Tarts:\nTransfer the tarts to a baking sheet and store them in a cool, dry location where they will be undisturbed (the inside an empty microwave works perfectly). Let the Pop-Tarts dry, uncovered, overnight. This will significantly improve their texture. Store in an airtight container, about two weeks at room temperature. The Pop-Tarts will, in fact, get better with age.\nSpecial Equipment\nKitchen scale\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nrolling pin\n,\npiping bag\nNotes\nFor a gluten free version, replace the all purpose flour with a blend of 8 ounces white rice flour, 1 ounce kinako (roasted soy flour), and 1 ounce buckwheat flour. I often use this blend at work and recommend it highly. For the breadcrumbs in the filling, simply use your favorite gluten-free crumbs.\nWith the frosting, you can use egg whites or corn syrup as a binder; the biggest difference is in drying time. The egg white version, essentially a\nroyal icing\n, will crust over within minutes and dry thoroughly in a few hours. Using corn syrup means being patient because the frosting will take up to 18 hours to dry.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStore in an airtight container, about two weeks at room temperature. The Pop-Tarts will, in fact, get better with age.\nPastries\nAmerican\nPie Dough\nPies",
