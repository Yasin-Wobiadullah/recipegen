  "full_text": "Oven-Dried Grapes (a.k.a. Raisins) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n4 hrs\nActive\n10 mins\nCooling Time\n15 mins\nTotal\n4 hrs 20 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nMakes\n1 1/2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\nlarge bunches\nseedless grapes\n, preferably mixed colors, stemmed\nVegetable or\ncanola oil\n, for greasing\nDirections\nPreheat oven to 225\u00b0F (110\u00b0C). Very lightly grease 2 rimmed baking sheets with oil, then scatter grapes all over. Bake, checking periodically for doneness, until grapes are nicely shriveled and semi-dried but still slightly plump, about 4 hours (see note). (The exact time will depend on your grapes, your oven, and your preferred degree of dryness.) Let cool. Use a thin metal spatula to free any grapes that are stuck to the baking sheet.\nThe dried grapes can be refrigerated in a sealed container for about 3 weeks. (How long they keep will also depend on their degree of dryness; drier grapes will keep longer.)\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheets\nNotes\nThe precise cooking time can vary quite a bit depending on the size of your grapes (larger ones will take longer to dry than smaller ones) and how your oven functions (some ovens are prone to big temperature swings, which can speed up and/or slow down total drying time). Make sure to check in on the progress of your grapes periodically to avoid any mishaps.\nRead More\nRaisin Bran Muffins\nHomemade Bagels\nRum Raisin Ice Cream\nBaked Fruit\nGrape\nSnacks & Appetizers"
