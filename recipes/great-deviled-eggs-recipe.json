Fill a large pot with 1 inch of water. Place steamer insert inside, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add eggs to steamer basket, cover, and continue cooking over high heat for 12 minutes. Immediately place eggs in bowl of ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under cool running water. Slice each egg in half lengthwise.\nPlace all yolks in the bowl of a food processor. Select 16 of the best-looking egg white halves and set aside; reserve remaining 8 for another use. Add mayonnaise, mustard, 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) vinegar, and hot sauce to food processor and process until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.\nWith machine running, slowly drizzle in 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil. Season mixture to taste with salt and remaining vinegar (if desired). Transfer to a zipper-lock bag. Filling and egg white halves can be stored in the refrigerator up to overnight before eggs are filled and served.\nCut off a corner of zipper-lock bag and pipe filling mixture into egg whites, overstuffing each. Drizzle with remaining olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper, chives, crushed red pepper or paprika, and sea salt. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nFor the best results, use really, really good olive oil.\nI like overstuffing the eggs, which leaves you with a few extra whites. Just eat 'em (or feed them to the dog). Eggs that are a couple of weeks old will peel more easily than very fresh eggs.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot\nwith\nsteamer insert\n,\nfood processor\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can boil the eggs and make the filling one day ahead of time.\nRead More\nDeviled Eggs With Confit Tuna, Olives, Tomato, and Olive Oil\n9 In-Your-Face Deviled Egg Variations\nTwo-Minute Mayonnaise\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nStovetop\nBoiled Eggs\nDeviled Eggs",
