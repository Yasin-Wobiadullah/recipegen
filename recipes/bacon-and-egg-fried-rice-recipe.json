Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.\nPour excess bacon fat into a small bowl, rinse and wipe out skillet, then return to high heat. Add one tablespoon bacon fat and heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nAdd 3 more tablespoons bacon fat to skillet (if there is not enough bacon fat, add vegetable oil to make up the difference), then add cooled rice. Cook, stirring and shaking constantly, until rice grains are separated, pressing to break up lumps with a spatula, about 2 minutes. Add peas and mix until ingredients are evenly combined.\nMove the rice to the sides of the pan, creating a well in the center. Add the beaten egg. When it starts to set, stir it into the rice.\nAdd soy sauce, chili paste, and sesame oil, and stir and toss to combine until well coated. Mix in reserved bacon, cover and remove from heat.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large non-stick skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add whole eggs and fry to desired doneness, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Divide rice between 4 plates, top each plate with a fried egg, sprinkle with scallions and/or cilantro, and serve immediately with extra chili sauce to pass.\nRice & Grains\nStir-Fry\nBacon\nQuick Breakfast\nQuick Dinners"
