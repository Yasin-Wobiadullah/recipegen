In a small bowl, massage the chayote slices with lemon zest, kosher salt, and sugar until evenly coated. Let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours in the refrigerator. Drain the accumulated liquid and discard.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a mandoline or sharp knife, slice the apple quarter into similarly thin lengthwise slices. Transfer to a bowl of lightly salted water (1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt per cup of water) to prevent browning.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo make the vinaigrette, in a small bowl, whisk together ponzu, soy sauce, seasoning oil, lemon juice, honey citron tea concentrate, and sesame oil until combined (it won't emulsify, that's okay).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen ready to serve, toss chayote, apple slices, and red shiso together. Add dressing 1 tablespoon at a time until sufficiently seasoned, about 4 tablespoons. Serve cold.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nMandoline slicer or sharp knife\nNotes\nRed shiso is my preferred herb in this salad, but basil, parsley, and cilantro would all work well.\nKorean honey-citron tea, a syrupy concentrate, can be found at most Korean grocery stores. Regular honey is also a good substitute.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe vinaigrette can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.\nApple\nSalads\nVegetarian\nSummer Salads\nSummer"
