Place bread cut-side-up on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and drizzle lightly all over with olive oil, then broil until well browned and crisp, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nTransfer top bun(s) to a large cutting board. Spread bottom bun(s) with extra sauce.\nFor the party-size sandwich:\nShingle the cutlets on the bottom bun so they all fit in a single layer covering the bread; cutlets should already have sauce and some cheese on them. Top with more cheese.\nFor individual subs:\nIf needed, cut the chicken cutlets in half lengthwise so they fit on the bread, then shingle on the bottom buns to fit (you should get abou one cutlet per sandwich). Top with more cheese.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nReturn to broiler and cook until cheese is fully melted and starting to bubble and brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately close sandwich, pressing down firmly to seal and let rest for 1 minute; alternatively, for the full Italian-deli experience, wrap the sandwich tightly in foil and let steam for 5 minutes before eating. For the party-size sandwich, slice into 6 to 8 single-serving pieces and serve.\nSerious Eats / Kevin White\nNotes\nYou can use our\nAll-Day Red Sauce\nor our\nQuick and Easy Red Sauce\nfor this recipe, or a jar of your favorite tomato sauce (we\nrecommend Rao's\n).\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nChicken Mains\nItalian-American\nMozzarella",
