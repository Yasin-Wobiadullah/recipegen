Cover and cook at high pressure for 40 minutes.\nFor extra-tender and creamy beans, allow pressure to release naturally. For firmer beans, use quick-release valve on an electric pressure cooker, or run a stovetop pressure cooker under cold running water until pressure dissipates. Remove lid and discard onion, orange, and bay leaves. Season to taste with salt and serve. Sprinkle with fresh cilantro at the table.\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric or stovetop pressure cooker\nNotes\nIn place of chorizo, you can use any type of firm, cured sausage, such as andouille, kielbasa, pepperoni, or salami.\nPressure Cooked Beans\nDairy-free Sides\nBraised & Stewed Beans\nBlack Beans\nSausages"
