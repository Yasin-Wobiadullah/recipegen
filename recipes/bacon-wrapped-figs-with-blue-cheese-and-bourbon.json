  "full_text": "Bacon-Wrapped Figs With Blue Cheese and Bourbon Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n25 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n16 pieces\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8\nslices\nthick-cut bacon\n, cut in half\n8\nfirm, ripe\nfresh figs\n, halved lengthwise\n6\nounces\n(\n170\ng\n) creamy\nblue cheese\n, crumbled (see notes)\n1/2\ncup\n(\n120\nml\n)\nbourbon\n3/4\ncup\n(\n6\nounces\n;\n170\ng\n)\nunsalted butter\n3/4\nlightly packed\ncup\nlight brown sugar\n(\n6\nounces\n;\n170\ng\n)\nFlaky salt\n, such as Maldon, for sprinkling (optional)\nDirections\nPreheat the broiler and set oven rack in top position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until most of the fat has rendered but the bacon is still pliable. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to absorb excess grease. Set aside.\nUsing a melon baller or small spoon, scoop out the center of each halved fig. Fill each hollowed fig half with blue cheese.\nWrap a half-strip of bacon around each filled fig half and secure with toothpicks. Place, cut side up, on the prepared baking sheet.\nIn a medium saucepan, cook bourbon over medium heat until reduced by half. Whisk in the butter and brown sugar until butter is melted and brown sugar is dissolved. Continue to cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nUsing a pastry brush, brush bourbon glaze all over the top side of each bacon-wrapped fig. Broil until the bacon has browned, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle lightly with coarse sea salt, if desired, and serve warm.\nSpecial equipment\nBaking sheet, small melon baller, toothpicks\nNotes\nOther creamy cheeses, such as goat cheese, cream cheese, or brie could be substituted for the blue cheese, if preferred.\nHors D'Oeuvres\nRoasting\nBlue Cheese\nFig\nBacon",
