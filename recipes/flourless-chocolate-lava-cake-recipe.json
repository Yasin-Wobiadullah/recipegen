  "full_text": "Flourless Chocolate Lava Cakes Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nTotal\n25 mins\nServes\n6\nto 7 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8\nounces\n70% bittersweet chocolate\n, finely chopped\n12 tablespoons (\n6\nounces\n)\nunsalted butter\n, cut into cubes\n4\nlarge\neggs\n1/2 cup (\n3 1/2\nounces\n)\ngranulated sugar\n1/8\nteaspoon\nsalt\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Butter seven 4-ounce ramekins (see notes).\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nUsing a microwave or a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, melt chocolate with butter, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nWhile chocolate is melting, whip eggs, sugar, and salt using a mixer fitted with a whip attachment on medium-high speed until mixture is lightened and pale in color, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nReduce speed to low and mix in chocolate mixture until combined. Spoon into cups and place on baking sheet. Bake until edges are set but center is underdone, about 10 minutes. Avoid over-baking. Let cool 3 minutes and serve.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nHand or stand mixer, 4-ounce or 6-ounce ramekins\nNotes\nI used paper baking cups which held 7 tablespoons of batter. Either 4-ounce or 6-ounce ramekins will also work. If using 6-ounce ramekins, divide batter between six ramekins instead of seven and increase bake time by 2 minutes. The Interior of the cake, while still gooey, should register 160\u00b0F when it comes out of the oven.\nCakes\nGluten-free Desserts\nChocolate"
