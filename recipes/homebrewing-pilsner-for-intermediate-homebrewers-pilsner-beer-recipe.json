  "full_text": "Pilsner (For Intermediate Homebrewers) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nActive\n5.5 to 8 hrs\nTotal\n0 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n7 pounds pilsner malt, crushed\n8 gallons of water split - blend 4 gallons tap water and 4 gallons distilled water\n1.5 pounds extra light dry malt extract\n1.5 ounces Saaz hops - 90 minutes\n1 ounce Saaz hops - 20 minutes\n1.5 ounces Saaz hops - 5 minutes\n1 ounce Saaz hops - 0 minutes (flame out)\nTwo 11.5 gram packages of dry lager yeast (Saflager S-23)\nDirections\nLine the 7.5 gallon kettle with the mesh bag, fill with 2.5 gallons of tap water and bring to 157\u00b0F (69\u00b0C). Remove from heat.\nMash-in by slowly adding 7 pounds of pilsner malt into the water and inside the bag. Stir for 2 minutes to prevent balls of grain from clumping together, creating a consistent mash. The temperature should equalize to about 148\u00b0F (64\u00b0C).\nCover the mash, only uncovering to briefly stir every 20 minutes. Heat 3 more gallons of water to 190\u00b0F (88\u00b0C).\nAfter 60 minutes, mash-out by carefully pouring the 190\u00b0F (88\u00b0C) water into the mash, stirring to equalize temperature to about 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C).\nSlowly raise the grain bag out of the liquid, allowing the wort to drain from the grain. Hold the grain bag above the kettle for 5 to 10 minutes as the wort drains. Top the wort off with water to 6.5 gallons and add 1.5 pounds extra light dry malt extract.\nBring wort to a vigorous boil. When the boil begins, add 1.5 ounce Saaz hops in a mesh bag.\nAfter boiling for 70 minutes, add 1 ounce Saaz hops in a mesh bag.\nAfter boiling for 85 minutes, add 1.5 ounce Saaz hops in a mesh bag.\nAfter total of 90 minutes of boil, remove from heat and add 1 ounce Saaz hops in a mesh bag.\nWarning:\nAfter wort cools below 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C) everything that touches it should be sanitary, and exposure to open air should be limited as much as possible.\nCool wort by placing pot in ice bath or by using a wort chiller until it is below 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). Transfer to sanitized fermentor (either a carboy or a fermentation bucket) and place in a temperature-controlled refrigerator set to 48\u00b0F (9\u00b0C).\nUse a sanitized auto-siphon racking cane to remove enough wort to take a gravity reading with your hydrometer. Make a note of this number, since you will be using it to calculate the actual alcohol content when it's done fermenting. The reading should be around 1.054. Cover fermentor with a sanitized stopper and airlock.\nAfter wort cools to 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C), agitate vigorously for at least 5 minutes. Add two 11.5-gram packages of Saflager S-23 yeast.\nFerment for at least 3 weeks at 48\u00b0F (9\u00b0C).\nAfter fermentation is complete, rack to a sanitized secondary carboy and allow the beer to raise to room temperature for 12 hours for a diacetyl rest.\nLager for 4 to 6 weeks by placing carboy in a temperature-controlled refrigerator set to 35\u00b0F (2\u00b0C).\nBottle after lagering is complete,\nusing enough priming sugar for a medium level of carbonation.\nSpecial Equipment\n7.5 gallon kettle (or bigger), extra-large mesh grain bag, the\nbasic homebrewing equipment setup\nand a temperature controlled refrigerator\nRead More\nHomebrewing: Essentials for Your First Brew\nHomebrewing: Carbonation and Bottling\nBeer"
