Remove kombu with tongs and discard or reserve for another use. (Kombu can be cut into thin slivers and tossed into a salad.)\nAdd a few tablespoons cold water to saucepan to lower temperature, then add katsuobushi and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer dashi for 7 minutes.\nStrain dashi through a fine-mesh strainer set over a heatproof bowl; discard katsuobushi. Return dashi to a clean saucepan. Drain wakame and add to dashi along with tofu; be very gentle, since tofu is fragile and will break easily. Set over medium heat until warmed through.\nIn a small bowl, whisk both misos with just enough warm dashi to dissolve into a thin paste. Remove dashi from heat and very gently stir in miso paste, being careful not to break the tofu.\nCarefully ladle soup into warmed bowls, garnish with scallions, and serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nIf you prefer to use only one type of miso in this recipe, try\nawase\n, which is an all-purpose option made from a combination of white and red miso.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nPlumbing the Depths of Miso Soup\nSoups\nJapanese\nStovetop Tofu\nTofu",
