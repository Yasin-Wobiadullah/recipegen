Bring to high pressure and cook for 60 minutes.

Using the same pressure cooker, combine oxtails with 1/2 cup cassareep, 7 sprigs thyme, 8 whole cloves, 1 cinnamon stick, and 2 cups water. Bring to high pressure and cook for 30\u00a0minutes.

Using the same pressure cooker, combine beef chuck with 1/2 cup cassareep, 7 sprigs thyme, 8 whole cloves, 1 cinnamon stick, and 3 cups water. Bring to high pressure and cook for 30 minutes.

Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 15 minutes; the stew's sauce should be brothy but with body. Season with salt, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nRemove from heat, then skim any fat from the surface. Serve with bread.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nNotes\nAsk your butcher to cut the beef foot and bone-in chuck for you; otherwise, substitute an equal weight of boneless beef chuck and leave the beef foot as-is.\nIf you can't find fresh Guyanese wiri wiri peppers, you can use dried ones or substitute Scotch bonnet peppers.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe stew can be refrigerated in an air-tight container for up to 5 days. Reheat gently before serving.\nOxtail\nBeef Chuck\nThe Latest\nGuyanese",
