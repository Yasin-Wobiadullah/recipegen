Seal and shake to combine thoroughly. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.\nWhen ready to fry chicken, fill a wok, Dutch oven, or large cast iron skillet with about 1 1/2 inches of oil and heat oil until it registers 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Fill a wide bowl with flour and another with egg.\nDrain chicken. Working in batches if necessary, dredge each piece of chicken in flour, shaking off excess, then dip in egg to coat. Let excess egg drizzle off, then add to hot oil; the oil temperature will drop. Fry chicken, turning occasionally and maintaining an oil temperature between 325\u00b0F and 350\u00b0F (165\u00b0C and 175\u00b0C), until chicken is golden brown outside and registers an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) for breasts and 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C) for drumsticks and thighs, about 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer fried chicken to paper towels to drain, then transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt. Allow chicken to rest for a full 3 minutes after breast core temperature rises to 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C). Serve right away with lemon wedges. Alternatively, allow to cool to room temperature, then re-fry in hot oil just before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\n,\nDutch oven\n, or large\ncast iron skillet\n;\ninstant-read thermometer\n; large\nrimmed baking sheet\n;\nwire rack\nNotes\nIf you don't want to break down a whole chicken, you can ask the butcher to do it for you, or buy roughly 3 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts, wings, drumsticks, and/or thighs from the supermarket meat case.\nThe choice of oil is a matter of personal preference: Olive oil will add a distinct Mediterranean flavor to the dish, but will also cover up some of the bright, lemony flavor. Meanwhile, neutral oils, like vegetable, peanut, and canola, will let more of that flavor come through.\nChicken Mains\nItalian\nFried Chicken\nWhole Chicken\nHanukkah",
