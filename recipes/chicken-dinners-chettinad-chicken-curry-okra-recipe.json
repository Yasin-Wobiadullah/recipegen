When shimmering, add 1 cup chopped onions, 5 chile peppers, coconut, coriander, cumin, fennel, fenugreek, and black pepper. Cook, stirring, until onions have softened, 10 to 12 minutes; cool briefly.\nTransfer mixture to food processor and pulse to a paste. Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in same unwashed saucepan over medium heat. When shimmering, add remaining onions, remaining 5 to 7 chili peppers, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, star anise, 1 teaspoon ground chile, curry leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until onions have softened, 10 to 12 minutes.\nStir in curry paste and tomatoes, and bring to simmer. Cook, stirring, until tomatoes have cooked down into a thick sauce, and mixture begins to look separated, about 20 minutes. (Reduce heat to medium-low if mixture is beginning to brown on bottom of pot).\nStir in tamarind (or lime juice) and chicken. Cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and/or ground chile.\nCook Okra\n: Heat oil (or ghee) in large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. When shimmering, add chiles and cumin, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in okra, broth, and salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until okra is just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season to taste. Serve curry and okra together immediately.\nNotes\nThis dish is meant to be hot and spicy, but can be tamed by adding less chiles. Adjust to taste. Dessicated coconut is unsweetened dried coconut. Don't substitute with sweetened coconut. If curry leaves are not available, simply omit. This dish is very forgiving, and the spices can be altered to taste.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor, large saucepan or skillet with lid\nChicken Breast\nIndian\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nOkra\nChicken Mains",
