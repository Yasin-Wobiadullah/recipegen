On first plate, whisk together white rice flour, granulated garlic, salt, dried basil, and freshly ground black pepper. On second plate, whisk eggs until smooth. On third plate, place bread crumbs.\nCut cheese sticks in half. Roll string cheese in white rice flour, coating well. You don\u2019t want any bare spots on the cheese stick. Take care to coat ends of cheese stick with flour. This prevents stick from \u201cleaking\u201d during frying.\nRoll cheese stick in egg, coating thoroughly. Return cheese stick to white rice flour and coat again. Return again to egg and coat thoroughly. Finally, roll coated sticks in bread crumbs. Place coated stick on a baking pan or large dish. Repeat until all sticks are coated. Chill cheese sticks for five minutes.\nHeat 1/2-inch of oil in an 8-inch frying pan. Sprinkle a little white rice flour on the surface of the oil. If flour sizzles, oil is ready.\nRemove cheese sticks from refrigerator. Place six cheese sticks into the pan. Fry for 30 seconds. Using a heat-proof spatula, roll sticks in oil to turn. Fry an additional 30 seconds or until the sticks are golden brown. If any cheese begins to leak, remove sticks from oil.\nRepeat with remaining cheese sticks. Serve with sauce and enjoy!\nHors D'Oeuvres\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nFrying\nCheese\nQuick Snacks",
