The membranes carry most of the heat, so leave as much or as little in as your heat tolerance likes. If you're using dried chiles, toast them till fragrant. Add them to a small pot with just enough water to cover, bring it to a boil, and let it cook, covered, for 20 minutes or until very soft.\nPur\u00e9e the chiles with just enough water to keep your blender moving. When you have a very smooth paste, push it through a fine mesh strainer to get rid of any errant fibers or seeds.\nReturn the strained paste to the blender and add the cheese, lemon juice, and sugar. Blend till smooth, then add salt to taste. The cheese is pretty salty, so add salt with care.\nAdd the oil to a pot on medium-high heat, and cook the garlic, stirring often, till lightly browned.\nAdd the sauce. Let it fry for a minute or two and then add the beans. Cover and cook the beans on medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, or until they bind with the sauce. Toss in some roughly chopped cilantro and serve.\nRead More\nSpice Hunting: Aji Amarillo\nHot Sauces\nPeruvian"
