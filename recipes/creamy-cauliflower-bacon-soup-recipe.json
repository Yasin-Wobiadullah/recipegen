Remove from Dutch oven with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving fat in Dutch oven.\nAdd onions, half of scallions, and garlic, and cook, stirring constantly and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.\nAdd chicken stock, bay leaves, half-and-half (or cream), and cauliflower. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until cauliflower is completely tender, about 30 minutes.\nWorking in batches, blend soup until completely smooth (if you don't have a very powerful blender, remove the bay leaf before blending. If an extra-smooth soup is desired, pass the soup through a fine-mesh strainer after blending); if soup is too thick, whisk in additional hot chicken stock, 1/2 cup at a time, until you've reached the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve sprinkled with crisp bacon pieces and remaining scallions.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nDutch oven\nRead More\nHow to Make Creamy Vegetable Soups Without a Recipe\nSoups\nStovetop\nBacon\nCauliflower\nChristmas Appetizers",
