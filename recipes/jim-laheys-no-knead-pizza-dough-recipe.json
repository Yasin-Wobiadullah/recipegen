  "full_text": "Jim Lahey's No-Knead Pizza Dough\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nRising Time\n18 hrs\nTotal\n18 hrs 10 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nMakes\n4 pizzas\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n500\ngrams\n(\n17 \u00bd\nounces\nor about\n3 \u00be\ncups\n)\nall-purpose flour\n, plus more for shaping the dough\n1\ngram\n(\n1/4\nteaspoon\n)\nactive dry yeast\n16\ngrams\n(\n2\nteaspoons\n)\nfine sea salt\n350\ngrams\n(\n1 \u00bd\ncups\n)\nwater\nDirections\nIn a medium bowl, thoroughly blend flour, yeast, and salt. Add water and, with a wooden spoon or your hands, mix thoroughly.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at room temperature (about 72\u00b0F/22\u00b0C) for 18 hours or until it has more than doubled. It will take longer in a chilly room and less time in a very warm one.\nFlour a work surface and scrape out the dough. Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them: For each portion, start with the right side of the dough and pull it toward the center; then do the same with the left, then the top, then the bottom. (The order doesn\u2019t actually matter; what you want is four folds.) Shape each portion into a round and turn seam side down. Mold dough into a neat circular mound. The mounds should not be sticky; if they are, dust with more flour.\nIf you don\u2019t intend to use the dough right away, wrap the balls individually in plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Return to room temperature by leaving them out on the counter, covered in a damp cloth, for 2 to 3 hours before needed.\nRead More\nWhat's The Best Way To Freeze Pizza Dough?\nJim Lahey's No Knead Broccoli Rabe, Garlic, Ginger, and Thai Chili Pizza\nJim Lahey's Basic Tomato Sauce\nPizza"
