Pour white wine into skillet and bring to a boil while scraping up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until raw alcohol smell has largely cooked off, then add the cooked bell peppers and onions to the skillet and simmer, stirring often, until jammy, about 20 minutes; add additional water 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, if needed, to keep vegetables from becoming overly dry.
