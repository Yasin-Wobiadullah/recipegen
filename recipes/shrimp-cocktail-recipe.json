Transfer to refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a medium pot, combine 1 quart water with white wine, celery, onion, fennel, garlic, ginger, tarragon, parsley, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Add reserved shrimp shells. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then lower heat and gently simmer for 20 minutes. Strain out and discard solids and return broth to pot. Add remaining 1 quart cold water (this will quickly lower the temperature of the broth).\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nAdd shrimp to pot with broth. Set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until temperature reaches 150\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer and shrimp are just cooked through; adjust heat to make sure temperature does not go much over 150\u00b0F. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to a rimmed baking sheet, spreading them in an even layer. Transfer to refrigerator until shrimp are cool, then transfer to an airtight container and continue to refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nFor the Cocktail Sauce:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together ketchup, horseradish, lemon juice, and ground coriander and garlic if using. Season cocktail sauce with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nSpoon cocktail sauce into a small bowl and serve with the chilled shrimp alongside.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nDevein the shrimp if you prefer by slicing along their backs and removing the vein (\nsee the video here for step-by-step instructions\n).\nPoaching\nChristmas Appetizers\nPoached Seafood\nSnacks & Appetizers\nEaster Appetizers"
