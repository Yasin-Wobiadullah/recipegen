Cover the bottom opening of the funnel with your finger and center over the saucepan. Pour batter into the funnel and move finger as needed to control the flow of the batter. Alternatively, transfer batter to a 4-cup liquid measuring cup for pouring slowly directly into the hot oil.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nCarefully squeeze batter from the prepared squeeze bottle or slowly pour and drizzle batter into hot oil, working quickly and swirling in a circular pattern around the circumference of the saucepan, then swirl and crisscross the batter over itself to fill in the funnel cake to form a round shape. use caution as the oil may bubble up slightly when initially pouring.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nFry cake until golden brown on the first side, 1 to 2 minutes.
