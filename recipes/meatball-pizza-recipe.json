Add sauce and half of basil, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd meatballs, dropping them into the simmering sauce one at a time. Cook, without moving, until meatballs are starting to set, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn meatballs in sauce and continue to cook, stirring gently and occasionally, until meatballs are fully cooked, about 3 more minutes.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to a bowl or plate, taking along as little sauce as possible. Discard cooked basil.\nTurn a single dough ball out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into a rough 8-inch circle, leaving the outer 1 inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles, forming a 12- to 14-inch circle about 1/4 inch thick. Transfer to a pizza peel.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSwitch broiler on high. Spread approximately 2/3 cup sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving a 1/2- to 1-inch border. Evenly spread one-third of cheese over sauce. Add one-third of meatballs. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil and sprinkle with basil leaves and salt. Slide pizza onto Baking Steel and bake until cheese is melted, with some browned spots, and crust is golden brown and puffed, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, sprinkle with 1/2 ounce Romano or Parmesan cheese, slice, and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J.
