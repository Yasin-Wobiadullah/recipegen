In a Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook until well browned, about 6 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken and cook on opposite sides until browned, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat and transfer chicken to a platter. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nReduce heat to medium, add onion and celery, and cook, stirring to prevent scorching, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil along with the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until peanut butter or darker in color, 5-10 minutes. While stirring vigorously, slowly add the stock. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, then boil until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nReduce heat to medium, then stir in garlic powder, onion powder, ground sage, ground oregano, and smoked paprika. Add the chicken pieces and return liquid to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, gently stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and beginning to fall from the bone and the sauce is reduced to a thick and silky texture, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIf desired, break apart chicken and remove bones. Serve over rice, grits, or pasta.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nWater is a great substitute when you\u2019re out of stock.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe prepared stew chicken can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; reheat gently to serve.\nChicken\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Mains\nChicken Legs\nThe Latest",
