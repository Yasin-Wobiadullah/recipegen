  "full_text": "The Best Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nActive\n5 mins\nFreezing Time\n8 hrs\nTotal\n8 hrs 5 mins\nServes\n1 serving\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nounces\n(\n60\nml\n)\naged\u00a0rum\n3/4\nounce\n(\n20\nml\n)\nfresh juice\nfrom\n1\nlime\n3/4 to 1\nounce\n(\n20-30\nml\n) 1:1 turbinado\nsimple syrup\n(see notes)\n2\nripe\nstrawberries\n(\n50\ng\n), quartered and leaves removed\nPinch\nsalt\nLime wheel,\nstrawberry\n, and/or straw, for garnish (optional)\nDirections\nAt least 8 hours before you plan to serve the drink, add rum, 3/4 ounce lime juice, and 3/4 ounce turbinado simple syrup to a resealable container or zipper-lock bag. Place batched mix in the freezer until freezer-cold, about 8 hours.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nWhen ready to serve, add quartered strawberries to blender. Add chilled cocktail mix, pinch salt, and 8 ice cubes. Pulse blender 5 times, then blend until uniform. Taste and add up to 1/4 ounce additional turbinado simple syrup as needed. Blend once more briefly and serve immediately, with a lime wheel, strawberry, and/or straw, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nIf you want to make multiple drinks, you can pre-batch up to a double recipe (a blender may not hold much more than that easily) in a single container, add 14 ice cubes, then divide after blending; if making more than two drinks, use separate containers to hold more servings.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nTo make turbinado simple syrup, combine equal volumes of turbinado sugar, such as Sugar in the Raw, and hot water in a tight-fitting resealable container such as a mason jar. Shake vigorously until sugar is completely dissolved; extra simple syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one month.\nRead More\nThe Best Frozen Daiquiri Recipe\nFrozen Fernet Daiquiri Recipe\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Rum\nRum\nStrawberry\nMother's Day\nFather's Day\nSummer Drinks",
