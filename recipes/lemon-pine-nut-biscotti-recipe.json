  "full_text": "Lemon Pine Nut Biscotti Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nCooling Time\n10 mins\nTotal\n65 mins\nServes\n12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 3/4\ncups\nall-purpose flour\n1/2\nteaspoon\nbaking powder\nScant 1/2\nteaspoon\nsalt\n1\ncup\nsugar\n2\nlarge\neggs\n1\nlarge\negg yolk\n1/2\nteaspoon\nvanilla\n1\ntablespoon\nlemon juice\nfrom about\n1/2\nlemon\n2\npacked teaspoons\nlemon zest\nfrom about\n1\nlarge lemon\n1/2\ncup\npine nuts\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.\nIn a large bowl, vigorously whisk together sugar, eggs, and egg yolk until light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk in vanilla, lemon juice, and zest. Add dry ingredients and stir to combine. Stir in pine nuts.\nFlour your hands (dough with be sticky) and form dough into one 4- by 12-inch long log (see note). Bake until just golden and starting to dry, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C).\nWhen cool enough to touch, use a serrated to cut cookies on the bias to be 1 1/2-inches wide. Place cookies cut side down on baking sheet and put back in oven until dry and toasted, 15 to 20 minutes more.\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk, baking sheet, parchment paper, serrated knife\nNotes\nWhen I say easy, I mean it: I like to use good old fashioned man power and just whisk the eggs and sugar together. If you'd like, you can use an electric beater.\nYou can either make large 4-inch cookies or smaller 2-inch cookies. If making the latter, simply divide the dough in two and shape into 2-inch high logs.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSerious Entertaining: An Italian Picnic\nCookies\nLemon\nPine Nuts\nItalian Cuisine",
