Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook until tender, about 3 hours, adding extra liquid as needed. Let tongue cool, then remove tongue from stock and set stock aside for another use.\nWhen tongue is cool enough to handle, peel the outer membrane off and discard. Cut tongue into slices slightly thicker than 1/4-inch.\nHeat 1/4 cup oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add slices of tongue and cook until brown and crisp on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip and brown other side, another 3 minutes. (Reduce heat if tongue or oil is smoking excessively.) As slices of tongue brown, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels.\nHeat remaining tablespoon oil in a wok set over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add chiles, scallions, and Sichuan peppercorns, and stir-fry until aromatic, 20 to 30 seconds.\nAdd slices of tongue to wok. Add chile bean paste and stir-fry vigorously to coat tongue, about 20 seconds longer. Add rice wine and soy sauce. Add salt to taste, about 1/2 teaspoon. Keep stirring tongue around in the wok to evenly distribute the seasonings. Remove from heat, stir in sesame and/or chile oil(s), and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nStainless steel skillet\n,\nwok\nNotes\nTo learn more about Chinese pantry ingredients, check out our article\nhere\n.\nChinese"
