Process until almost smooth. Season to taste with plenty of black pepper and a little salt (depending on how salty your pickles were, you may not need any extra salt). Set spread aside.\nHeat an electric griddle to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Squirt 12 dots of mustard of about 3/4-teaspoons each in an evenly spaced grid over the surface of the griddle, leaving about 3-inches between each dot. Place one ball of meat on top of each dollop. Season generously with salt and pepper, then smash down with a stiff spatula into patties approximately 1/4-inch thick and 3-inches wide. Spread onions evenly over surface of burger patties and press down with spatula. Allow to cook for 1 minute on first side.\nFlip patties so that onions are underneath (patties will not necessarily be colored\u2014this is ok; the flavor in sliders comes from steam, not from browning). Top each patty with a half slice of American cheese. Place top buns cut-side-down on top of patties and top with bottom buns, also cut-side-down. Drape a towel over the whole griddle to trap steam.\nCook, pressing gently down on towel occasionally until buns are heated completely through and burger patties are cooked, about 2 minutes. Remove towel and transfer bottom buns to a serving platter. Divide spread evenly between bottom buns. Top each bottom bun with a burger patty and top bun, making sure to get all of the onions off of the griddle. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric griddle, clean kitchen towel\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Burger Lab: The In-N-Out, Telway, White Manna Ultimate Animal-Style Slider Mashup\nBurgers\nNorth American\nStovetop Beef\nGround Beef\nBeef Mains",
