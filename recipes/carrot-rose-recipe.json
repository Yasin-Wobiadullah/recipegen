  "full_text": "Twisted Carrot Roses\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\nAbout 30 mins\nTotal\n25 mins\nServes\n12\nto 30 roses, depending on size\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nAbout\n6\nlarge\ncarrots\n, at least 1 inch thick and preferably 7 to 8 inches in length\n8\nounces\nwater\n(about\n1\ncup\n;\n225\ng\n)\n7\nounces\nsugar\n(about\n1\ncup\n;\n200\ng\n)\n1/4\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight\nDirections\nPeel the carrots, then place on a cutting board; with a vegetable peeler pressed firmly against the root end, drag the blade down its length. Discard the first few thin and irregular strips, and continue peeling to amass a pile of thick, even ribbons.\nCombine water, sugar, and salt in a 2-quart stainless steel saucier over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Drop carrot ribbons into the bubbling syrup, simmer 30 seconds, then shut off the heat. When cool enough to handle, fish out a ribbon and let the excess syrup drip off.\nHolding the skinny end with your dominant hand, twist and wrap a carrot ribbon around itself to form a \"bud.\" Continue twisting and wrapping to create the remaining petals, then tuck the end of the strip underneath itself. If you like, more strips can be added to create a larger rose. Place on a fully frosted\nBrown Butter Carrot Cake\n, repeating with additional carrot roses to create a lush bouquet.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nVegetable peeler\n, 2-quart stainless steel saucier\nNotes\nFor a fancy, luminous effect, dissolve a few grams of pale gold luster dust in a tablespoon of lemon juice to brush over the finished roses.\nCarrots\nPoaching"
