Squeeze out the excess water. Discard the stems and thinly slice the mushroom caps.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles 1 to 2 minutes less than stated in the package instructions, or just before al dente. Drain the noodles, rinse under cold water, and drain again thoroughly. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the sesame oil.\nPrepare the marinade:\nIn a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, and rice wine. Add chicken, toss to coat, and let stand at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes.\nPrepare the sauce:\nIn a small bowl, stir together the chicken stock, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and pepper. Set aside.\nHeat a wok or large skillet over high heat until a bead of water sizzles and evaporates on contact. Add 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Add the chicken and stir-fry until no longer pink on the outside but not yet cooked through, 2 minutes. Add the onion, bell pepper, carrot, bean sprouts, and mushrooms. Cook for another 2 minutes, until the vegetables are tender-crisp and the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the wok and set aside.\nSwirl the remaining 2 tablespoons oil into the pan. When the oil is hot and glistening, add the noodles and stir-fry until some of the strands turn golden, about 2 minutes. Make a well in the middle of the noodles and pour in the sauce. Return the chicken and vegetables to the wok and stir until everything is well coated and heated through. Transfer to a plate and serve.\nPasta Mains\nChinese-American\nChicken Breast\nEgg Noodles\nShiitake Mushroom",
