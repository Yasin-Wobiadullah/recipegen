Toss squash with oil and salt, then arrange on a rimmed 13- by 18-inch baking sheet, making sure to not overcrowd. Roast, stirring occasionally, until squash is tender and beginning to brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside. Reduce oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nFor the Curry:\nIn a wok or large saut\u00e9 pan, heat coconut oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add roasted squash, stirring to coat it with the curry paste. Add salt and soy sauce. Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture slightly darkens in color, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and gradually add half the coconut milk (200ml; about 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon). Simmer, stirring and scraping bottom and sides frequently, until sauce is thick, pudding-like, and has reduced by 1/3, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with additional salt and soy sauce as needed and let cool for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nIn a food processor, pur\u00e9e curried squash mixture smooth. Let cool for 5 minutes. Add yolks and process until thoroughly incorporated. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip egg whites on medium speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 5 minutes. Using a flexible spatula, add about 1/3 beaten whites into squash mixture and gently fold to combine. Gently fold in remaining whites until mixture is smooth and no streaks remain. Carefully scrape mixture into an ungreased 8- by 8-inch square baking dish. Bake until the souffl\u00e9 has puffed up by about 1 inch and the top is just firm to the touch, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nIn a 2-quart saucepan, bring remaining 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon (about 200ml) coconut milk to a simmer over medium heat. In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch and cold water until smooth. Stream cornstarch mixture into coconut milk, whisking to incorporate, and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nTop curried squash with coconut milk, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Garnish with makrut lime leaves and chile and serve with jasmine rice.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed 13- by 18-inch baking sheet, wok or large saut\u00e9 pan, food processor stand mixer, 8- by 8-inch baking dish, 2-quart saucepan\nNotes\nRefined coconut oil or neutral oil like canola or vegetable can be used in place of unrefined coconut oil.\nTamari can be used in place of soy sauce.\nFresh makrut lime leaves can be purchased at Southeast Asian grocery stores. To remove the tough ribs of Makrut lime leaves: fold the leaf in half lengthwise so that the rib is exposed to one side, then slice it off with a sharp knife. If you can\u2019t find makrut lime leaves, you can garnish the souffl\u00e9 with fresh zest from one lime.\nWhile I prefer Fresno chiles for the bright color and moderate heat, you can substitute red bell peppers for a milder flavor or bird\u2019s eye chiles for more heat.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe squash can be roasted and even pur\u00e9ed up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container.\nThe squash curry can be baked and refrigerated up to 1 day in advance. The curry will have deflated slightly, but will still taste good. To reheat, bake curry at 375\u00baF (190\u00baC) until warmed through, about 15 minutes. Garnish with lime leaves and chiles and serve.\nButternut Squash\nThe Latest\nThai\nVegetarian"
