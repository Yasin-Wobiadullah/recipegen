  "full_text": "Turmeric Chicken with Sumac and Lime from 'The New Persian Kitchen'\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n50 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nteaspoon\nground turmeric\nSea salt\nand freshly ground black pepper\n4\nbone-in chicken thighs\n2\ntablespoons\ngrapeseed oil\n3/4\ncup\nwater\n4\ncloves\ngarlic\n, minced\n2\njuicy\nlimes\n, halved\nSumac\n, for garnish\nDirections\nIn a small bowl, mix the turmeric with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Place the chicken on a rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle with the spice mixture, turning to coat both sides.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Brown the chicken well on both sides, about 7 minutes per side. Pour in the water, then add the garlic, stirring it into the water. Bring the water to a boil, then turn down the heat to low and cover. Braise the chicken for 25 minutes, until the inside is opaque. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter, turn up the heat to high, and reduce the cooking liquid for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until it\u2019s slightly thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and pour the sauce over the chicken.\nDust the chicken with sumac and pepper, garnish with lime halves, and serve.\nVegetarian Option:\nUse whole portobello mushrooms in place of the chicken, or use 1 pound firm tofu, well drained and cut into slabs 1 inch thick. You will need a little extra oil for searing than what is called for in the recipe.\nMiddle Eastern\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Thighs"
