In a large wide pot or Dutch oven, cook bacon over medium heat, turning, until fat has rendered and bacon is crisp, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer bacon to a paper-towel lined plate to drain.\nAdd onions and garlic to rendered bacon fat in pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent and soft, about 7 minutes. Stir in crushed red pepper and cook for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and their juices and bring to a simmer. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, crushing tomatoes with a wooden spoon, until only small chunks remain. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until sauce has thickened to a spoonable, ketchup-like consistency, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper.\nMeanwhile, sprinkle Pecorino Romano in four 5-inch rounds on silpat and bake until lightly browned and melted, about 10 minutes. Let cheese crisps cool until crisp.\nWhen ready to serve, season burger patties generously with salt and pepper and cook burgers to desired doneness on a hot grill or in a skillet on the stovetop, 125\u00b0F for medium rare or 135\u00b0F for medium. Transfer to a plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes.\nPlace 4 pieces of focaccia on a work surface and set burger patties on top. Top patties with tomato-onion jam, followed by bacon, and cheese crisps. Close sandwiches with remaining focaccia and serve right away.\nNotes\nThis recipe makes more sauce than you will need for the burgers, but it's worth having some extra to use on pasta or serve as a condiment with roast chicken, pork, or fish. Refrigerate extra sauce in an airtight container for up to 4 days.\nSpecial Equipment\nSilpat nonstick baking mat\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBurger Toppings Week: The Amatriciana Burger\nBurgers\nItalian-American\nStovetop Beef\nGround Beef\nBacon",
