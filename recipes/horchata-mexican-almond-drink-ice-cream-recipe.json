Add half-and-half, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. Remove from heat, cover, and let steep for two hours.\nIn a second saucepan, whisk together sugar and egg yolks until well combined and slightly thickened.\nUsing a fine mesh strainer or a couple layers of cheesecloth, strain dairy mixture into a large measuring cup or bowl. Press down firmly on rice with a wooden spoon to release as much dairy and rice starch as possible. Strained dairy should yield about 2 1/2 cups. Discard rice and almonds.\nTransfer strained dairy to saucepan with egg yolks and sugar and whisk until very well combined. Put saucepan on medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until a custard forms on the back of a spoon and a swiped finger leaves a clean line. Stir in vanilla, then salt.\nPour custard through a fine mesh strainer into an airtight container and chill overnight. The next day, churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer ice cream to container and chill in freezer for at least 3 to 4 hours before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\n;\nfine-mesh strainer\n, cheese cloth, or nut milk bag\nRead More\nHorchata Recipe\nPeanut Horchata Sorbet Recipe\nHow to Add Rich, Nutty Depth to Any Ice Cream Recipe\nIce Cream\nDairy Milk"
