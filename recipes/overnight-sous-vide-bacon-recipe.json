Place bacon, still in its original plastic packaging, directly in water bath and cook for at least 8 and up to 48 hours. When ready to serve, remove from water bath and proceed immediately to step 2, or chill in refrigerator or freezer for later use (see notes).\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTo finish, preheat a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add bacon and cook, pressing gently with a press or the back of a spatula (just enough to keep it mostly flat), until brown and crisp on the first side, about 2 minutes. Turn bacon and briefly cook on second side, just to remove pale color (about 15 seconds).\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTransfer to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to remove excess fat. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion circulator\nNotes\nYou can cook as much bacon as will fit in the water bath used in step 1.\nBacon can be cooked directly in its package.
