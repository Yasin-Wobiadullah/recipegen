Serve.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nGravy can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container. Reheat in a saucepan on low heat, adding stock as needed to loosen, until warmed through. Gravy can also be made several hours ahead and kept warm in a slow cooker until ready to serve.\nCondiments & Sauces\nGluten-free\nStovetop\nThanksgiving"
