Lower heat to a bare simmer. Season lightly with salt.\nMeanwhile, in a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs and cheese until thoroughly mixed.\nSlowly pour egg mixture into the soup while whisking. Return to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Season with salt once more, if needed.\nYou can season and garnish the soup as desired. A light grating of nutmeg is traditional, as is some finely grated lemon zest, and even a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Garnish with parsley, if you like. Serve hot.\nSpecial Equipment\nSaucepan, whisk\nNotes\nHomemade stock is very important here, since it's very exposed. Store-bought broths and stocks can be used, but we don't recommend it since they generally don't taste nearly as good. To make a simple beef broth, simmer beef stewing meat, bones, and/or ground beef and aromatic vegetables like carrot, onion, celery, and garlic until flavorful (at least 1 hour); you can also use a pressure cooker for a beef broth, which should cut the cooking time down to about 30 or 45 minutes.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe broth can be made in advance, but the egg mixture is best when added shortly before serving. Still, the finished soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat gently before serving.\nRead More\nBasic Chicken Stock\nPressure Cooker Chicken Stock\nHomemade Chicken Soup\nAvgolemono Soup (Greek Lemon-Egg Chicken Soup)\nEgg Drop Soup Recipe\nMoroccan Egg Drop Harira (Vegetable and Legume Soup)\nSoups\nItalian\nStovetop\nEggs",
