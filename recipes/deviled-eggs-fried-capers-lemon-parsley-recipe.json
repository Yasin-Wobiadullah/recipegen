Fold towels over and press firmly to dry capers thoroughly. In a medium pot, heat oil to 350\u00b0F as registered on an instant read thermometer. Carefully add capers and stand back (they will bubble and spit). Cook, stirring with a metal spider, until bubbling slows to a steady stream, about 30 seconds. Immediately remove capers from oil and transfer to paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.\nPlace all of the yolks in a medium bowl. Select 8 of the best looking egg white halves and set aside. Reserve the remaining 4 for another use. Add fried capers (reserving 16 as garnish), mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice and zest, olive oil, and parsley. Using a stiff whisk, mash and stir until well combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nTransfer yolk filling to zipper-lock bag. Filling and egg white halves can be stored covered in the refrigerator up to overnight before filling and serving (lay egg white halves cut-side-down on a large plate and cover with plastic wrap). Fried caper garnish can be stored in a sealed container at room temperature (allow to cool completely before closing container). Cut off corner of zipper-lock bag and pipe filling mixture into egg white halves, overstuffing each hole. Garnish with fried capers and parsley. Drizzle with olive oil and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nThermometer\nThis Recipe Appears In\n9 In-Your-Face Deviled Egg Variations\nDeviled Eggs\nSoul Food & Southern\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nHors D'Oeuvres\nQuick Snacks"
