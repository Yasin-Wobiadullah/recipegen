Transfer pur\u00e9ed livers to a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nIf using pork shoulder, blot dry with paper towels, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, then proceed to Step 3. If using pig ears, snout, and/or jowl, place pork in stockpot or Dutch oven, cover with water and boil until tender, between 60 to 90 minutes. Using tongs, transfer pig ears, snout, and/or jowl to a rimmed baking sheet and set aside until cool enough to handle. Blot dry with paper towels and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, then proceed to Step 3.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nSet a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet lined with a double layer of paper towels. In a wok, heat 2 cups (475ml) oil over medium-high heat until it registers 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Working in 3 batches, carefully lower a third of the pork shoulder, pig ears, snout, and/or jowl into the oil and fry until lightly browned all over, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer pork to prepared rack. Return oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and repeat with remaining pork. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nIn a 12-inch cast iron skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and golden brown in color, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nAdd reserved fried pork, pur\u00e9ed chicken livers (if using), soy sauce, calamansi juice, and chiles, and mix until well combined.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nIncrease heat to high and bring to a boil. Break eggs directly into pan, spacing them evenly around perimeter. Lower heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook, without stirring, until egg whites are opaque and yolks are runny but turning yellow on the edges, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nAdd mayonnaise and scallion and mix with pork and eggs until fully combined. Serve immediately with cooked white rice and calamansi halves.\nSerious Eats / Rezel Kealoha\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch cast iron skillet with lid\n,\nblender\n,\nwok\n,\nDutch oven\nor stockpot, rimmed baking sheet, wire rack\nNotes\nFeel free to use any one of these cuts of pork alone or in a combination.\nCalamansi is difficult to source fresh in the US, but occasionally Filipino groceries located in California or Florida will have them. You can also buy frozen calamansi juice from a well-stocked Asian or Filipino market; it has a better flavor than bottled options. If you're not able to find calamansi, substitute by following a formula of one part freshly squeezed lemon juice to one-half part freshly squeezed lime juice to one-quarter part granulated sugar (by volume).\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nSisig can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Leftovers make a great addition to\nfried rice\n.\nFilipino\nPork\nEggs\nPork Shoulder\nSnacks & Appetizers"
