  "full_text": "Caesar Deviled Eggs\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n30 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nTotal\n45 mins\nServes\n12 servings\nMakes\n24 deviled eggs\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ndozen\nlarge eggs\n1/2\ncup\n(\n120\ng\n)\nCaesar mayonnaise\nor\nregular mayonnaise\n(see note)\n1\nounce\nParmigiano-Reggiano\n, finely grated (\n30\ng\n; about\n1/2\ncup\n), plus thinly shaved pieces for garnish\n2\ntablespoons\n(\n30\nml\n)\nfresh lemon juice\n(from\n1\nwhole\nlemon\n)\nKosher salt\nand\nfreshly ground black pepper\n24\n1-inch pieces\nromaine lettuce\n, for garnish\n24\noil-packed anchovy\nfillets\n, for garnish\nToasted\nbread crumbs\nfor garnish\nDirections\nBring 4 quarts (4L) water to a boil in a large pot and prepare an ice bath. Carefully lower eggs into pot and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer), and continue cooking for 12 minutes for hard-cooked yolks. Immediately transfer eggs to ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes, then peel under cool running water. Halve eggs lengthwise and scoop yolks into a medium mixing bowl; reserve egg white halves.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and lemon juice to egg yolks. Using a sturdy whisk, mash and stir together until thoroughly combined. Season with salt, and very generously with black pepper.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer yolk filling to zipper-lock bag. Cut off corner of zipper-lock bag and pipe filling mixture into egg white halves, overstuffing each hole. Garnish deviled eggs with romaine lettuce, Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings, anchovy fillets, additional black pepper, and toasted bread crumbs. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nIf using regular mayonnaise and not Caesar mayo, add 1 teaspoon fish sauce, 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, and 2 cloves very finely minced garlic to the egg yolk filling for a more Caesar-like flavor. Alternatively, you could just spike the egg yolk filling with an equal quantity of\nCaesar dressing\n; it'll make a slightly thinner result, but will still work.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nFilling and egg white halves can be stored covered in the refrigerator up to overnight before filling and serving (lay egg white halves cut-side-down on a large plate and cover with plastic wrap). Deviled eggs are best consumed the day they are assembled, but are safe to store in the refrigerator for up to three days.\nDeviled Eggs\nThe Latest\nSnacks & Appetizers\nEaster Appetizers"
