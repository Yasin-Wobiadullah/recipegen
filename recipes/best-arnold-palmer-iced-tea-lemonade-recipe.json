  "full_text": "The Best Arnold Palmer (Half and Half Iced Tea + Lemonade) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n3 hrs 30 mins\nActive\n35 mins\nTotal\n3 hrs 30 mins\nServes\n6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\npounds\n(\n1.3\nkg\n)\nlemons\n(\n10 to 14\nmedium\nlemons\n)\n14\nounces\nsugar\n(\n2\ncups\n;\n400\ng\n)\n4\ncups\ncold-brewed black tea\nDirections\nBring lemons to room temperature, then roll firmly against the counter to soften their rinds. Halve and juice; pour juice into a sealable container and refrigerate. Cut rinds into 1-inch chunks. Toss with sugar in a large nonreactive mixing bowl, cover tightly with plastic, and let stand at room temperature, stirring once every 45 minutes or so, until sugar has completely dissolved, about 3 hours. (You can let the mixture stand up to 12 hours, if desired.)\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nAdd 8 ounces (1 cup) of reserved lemon juice to rind mixture. Stir well, then strain through a nonreactive fine-mesh strainer or piece of cheesecloth into a glass or ceramic container; discard rinds. At this point, the concentrated lemonade can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nWhen ready to serve, pour concentrated lemonade and cold-brewed tea into a pitcher and stir. Serve in ice-filled glasses.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpecial Equipment\nCheesecloth or nonreactive\nfine-mesh strainer\n, 2-quart pitcher\nNotes\nYou will likely have some fresh lemon juice left over, which can be reserved for another use or added to individual glasses to make Arnold Palmer more tart to taste.\nRead More\nThe Best Iced Tea (Cold-Brewed Iced Tea)\nUltra-Flavorful Fresh Lemonade\nTeas\nLemon\nFather's Day\nSummer Drinks",
