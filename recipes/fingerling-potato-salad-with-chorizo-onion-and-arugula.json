Add enough salt to make the water unpleasantly salty (don't worry, the potatoes won't end up too salty). Add oregano or thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a bare simmer and cook until you can easily slide a fork through the potatoes, about 25 minutes. (This is a very rough estimate; actual cooking time will vary with the size of the potatoes, so check them often.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRemove potatoes from heat and let them cool in their cooking water.\nMeanwhile, place half the diced onion in a medium nonreactive bowl. Add just enough sherry vinegar to cover and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a skillet, warm olive oil over medium heat. Add chorizo and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chorizo to a plate. Add remaining onion to skillet, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring frequently, until starting to brown, about 3 minutes; lower heat if onions threaten to burn at any point.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDrain potatoes and discard herbs. If potatoes are very small, you can leave them whole; otherwise, cut into halves or quarters. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl. Add chorizo and saut\u00e9ed onion along with the cooking oil.\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer quick-pickled onions to bowl with potatoes; reserve vinegar. Toss to combine. Dress with more olive oil as desired, then add reserved vinegar, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, tossing between additions, until desired flavor is reached. Season with salt, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nJust before serving, add arugula and toss well. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nMedium\nsaucepan\nor\nsaucier\n,\nlarge skillet\nRead More\nJapanese Potato Salad With Cucumbers, Carrots, and Red Onion\nGerman Potato Salad\nSpanish-Style Migas With Chorizo, Peppers, and Kale\nDairy-free Salads\nGluten-free Salads\nPork\nSausages\nArugula"
