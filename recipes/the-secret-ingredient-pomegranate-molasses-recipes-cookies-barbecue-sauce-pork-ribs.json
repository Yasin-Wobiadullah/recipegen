Season the ribs with salt and pepper, and put onto a baking sheet, underside up. Bake for 30 minutes. Turn the rack over so that it is meat-side up, and bake for 30 minutes. Glaze the whole rack of ribs with Pomegranate Molasses Barbecue Sauce, and bake underside up for 20 minutes.\nRaise the heat to 450\u00b0F, and while the oven is heating up, re-glaze the top, meaty part of the ribs once again with the Pomegranate Molasses Barbecue Sauce. Bake for 15 minutes, or until charred.\nTo make BBQ Sauce:\nMash together the onion and the garlic in a food processor. I always like to annihilate the garlic first on its own to get it really chopped, then add the onion.\nHeat the olive oil in a sauce pot on medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and season with salt and pepper. Add the thyme, and sweat for 5 minutes on medium-low heat.\nAdd the ketchup, molasses, sugar, vinegar, dry mustard, cumin, and paprika. Season again with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 25 minutes. That's it!\nPork\nDairy-free Mains\nRoasted Pork\nPomegranate\nBarbecue Sauce"
