Stir until sugar is dissolved, then add cranberries. Bring to a boil then lower heat to medium and vigorously simmer until cranberries have popped and mixture is reduced in half, about 20 minutes.\nAdd orange pur\u00e9e and hazelnuts and cook 2 minutes more. Take off heat and let cool slightly before adding to oatmeal. Any unused compote can be kept in the refrigerator for up to two weeks; see note.\nTo assemble:\nPlace cooked oatmeal in a bowl and stir in milk. Top with 1/3 cup compote and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nSaucepan\n,\nfood processor\nNotes\nTo make orange pur\u00e9e, wash and quarter a medium sized seedless orange. Place quarters (with rind) in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped but still with visable chunks. A medium orange should produce about 1 cup pur\u00e9e.\nThis will make about 4 cups or 12 servings of compote. It is also good spread on toast, stirred into yogurt, or poured over ice cream.\nFeel free to use any oatmeal that you like\u2014if plain instant is your choice, that's fine. Personally I prefer\nold fashioned rolled oats\nfor their hearty texture.\nOatmeal\nJams & Jellies\nOats"
