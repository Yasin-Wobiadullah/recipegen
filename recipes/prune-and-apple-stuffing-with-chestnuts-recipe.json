Arrange bread in a single even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total, stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Increase oven heat to 325\u00b0F.\nMeanwhile, in a large Dutch oven, melt butter or render reserved goose fat over medium heat, 2-3 minutes. Add sausage and mash with stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no greater than 1/4 inch thick). Cook, stirring frequently, until only a few bits of pink remain, about 4 minutes. Add onions, celery, and apples and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 12-15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chestnuts and prunes with their soaking liquid.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together chicken stock, eggs, sage, cloves, nutmeg, salt, and pepper until homogeneous. Stirring constantly with wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture. Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed.\nUse part of stuffing to stuff bird if desired (not recommended if making goose, which will yield an extremely fatty, excessively rich stuffing) or transfer to a buttered 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish (or 10- by 14-inch oval dish), cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer registers 150\u00b0F when inserted into center of dish, about 45 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown and crisp on top, about 15 minutes longer. Serve.\nSpecial equipment\nDutch oven, 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish (or 10- by 14-inch oval dish), rimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nIf making this recipe in conjunction with our\nroast goose\n, use reserved fat in place of butter. Pat it dry and chill it before mincing.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nI Don't Know From Goose: A Jewish Christmas Story\nThanksgiving Stuffings\nApple\nPlum\nChestnut\nSausages"
