In a large bowl, toss together the mushroom, onion, garlic, carrot, celery, 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil and kosher salt. Spread onto two foil-lined sheet trays. Roast until deeply browned, about 45 minutes, tossing vegetables every 15 minutes.\nIn a 4-quart sauce pot over medium heat, add remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and tomato paste. Cook tomato paste until caramelized and deep mahogany, about 5 minutes. Add 6 cups (48 ounces; 1.3L) water, roasted vegetables, and vegetable base. Simmer for 45 minutes. Using a fine-mesh sieve, strain mushroom stock, pressing firmly on solids.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the cheesesteak filling:\nRemove yuba from package and cut into 1-inch strips. (Optional: Place cut yuba in a large bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the nozzle of a smoking gun under the plastic wrap. Light smoking gun until the bowl fills with smoke. Let the yuba sit in the smoke for 30 minutes, adding more smoke as needed.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhile stock is simmering, over medium-low heat in a medium saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil and add onions. Cook gently until caramelized, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a splash of water as needed.\nToss the shredded trumpet mushroom with the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread onto a foil-lined sheet tray and roast at 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C) until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large saute pan over high heat, add the sugar and caramelize until deep golden brown. Add the yuba strips, stirring to distribute caramel. Add the paprika, garlic powder, mushroom stock, and black pepper. Simmer until most of the liquid has reduced and the yuba is glazed. Remove from heat and stir in the mustard, caramelized onions, and roasted trumpet mushrooms.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo assemble the sandwiches:\nIf desired, warm or toast the hoagie buns. Split open the buns and spread with 1/4 cup of\nVegan Nacho Cheese Sauce\n. Divide the yuba filling among the six buns and top with extra cheese. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nHalf sheet pan,\nfine-mesh strainer\n, smoking gun (optional)\nNotes\nKenji's recipe for\nVegan Nacho Cheese Sauce\nhas a lot of heat and a southwestern taste. For something with flavors closer to a true cheesesteak omit the jalape\u00f1o, chipotle, and hot sauce. Instead, add 1 teaspoon tomato paste to the onions and blend in 1/2 cup nutritional yeast flakes at the end. If you do not own a smoking gun, you can\nuse a wok to smoke the yuba\n, or you can add 1/4 teaspoon (1ml) good-quality liquid smoke, such as Wright's or Colgin to the yuba mixture at the end of Step 6.\nDairy-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nRoasted Vegetables\nMushrooms",
