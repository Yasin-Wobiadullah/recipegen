Transfer to large bowl and freeze until set, 1 to 2 hours.\nFor the Banana-Walnut Cookies:\nMeanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. In medium stainless steel skillet (see note), melt butter over medium heat. Cook butter, swirling pan occasionally, until beginning to foam. As foam settles, brown bits of butter will become visible at the bottom of the pan (5 to 7 minutes). Immediately remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Stir in cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Transfer to large bowl and cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes.\nWhisk flour, chopped walnuts, wheat germ, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl. Whisk 1 1/2 cups brown sugar into butter and stir until well combined. In small bowl, beat together banana, egg, egg yolk, and vanilla. Whisk into butter mixture.\nAdd flour mixture to butter mixture and combine with wooden spoon. If mixture appears too soft to roll into balls, refrigerate until firm, 15 to 30 minutes.\nScoop dough into 2-tablespoon portions and roll into balls. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and granulated sugar in medium bowl and toss cookie dough balls to coat. Arrange about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets and press down to make 2-inch diameter discs. Press 12 walnut halves into 12 cookies.\nBake cookies until edges are set and centers are still slightly soft, 12 to 14 minutes, rotating and alternating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer to cooling racks and cool on sheets 5 minutes, then transfer directly to cooling racks and cool completely, about 30 minutes.\nTo Assemble:\nSpread 1/3 cup ice cream on bottom side of 12 cookies, leaving a 1/2 inch border. Top with remaining 12 cookies and press down gently. Arrange ice cream sandwiches on plate or baking sheet and freeze to set, about 30 minutes. If desired, make chocolate dip (see below) and dip in half of ice cream sandwich. Serve immediately.\nFor the Chocolate Dip:\nPlace chocolate in medium bowl and microwave until smooth and melted, about 1 minute, pausing every 20 seconds to stir. Alternatively, bring about 2 inches water to boil in medium saucepan. Place chocolate in medium bowl and set on saucepan, making sure bottom of bowl is not making contact with boiling water. Stir chocolate until smooth and melted, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, 2\nrimmed baking sheets\n, parchment paper, medium\nstainless steel skillet\n,\nwhisk\n,\nwooden cooking spoon\n,\ncooling racks\nNotes\nBourbon ice cream is a serving suggestion; you can skip this step and use your favorite flavor of ice cream.\nUse a stainless steel skillet to brown the butter; a dark-bottomed skillet will make it difficult to see the butter as its color begins to change.\nIce Cream\nChocolate\nBanana\nWalnuts\nCookies",
