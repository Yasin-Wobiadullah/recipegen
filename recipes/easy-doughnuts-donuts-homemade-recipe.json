(Oil should be 1- to 1 1/2 inches deep). Pop open biscuit container. If any of the biscuits look irregular, gently pat them down to even rounds and even thickness. Cut out doughnut holes.\nAdd half of the doughnuts and half of the doughnut holes and fry until the bottoms turn golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes for small doughnuts and 2 to 2 1/2 minutes for large doughnuts. Using chopsticks, turn the doughnuts and holes and fry for until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer.\nTransfer doughnuts to a paper towel-lined plate and allow to cool slightly, 1 to 2 minutes before dipping in glaze. Serve warm.\nFor the plain glaze:\nPlace confectioners\u2019 sugar and salt in medium bowl. Add melted butter, milk, and vanilla extract and whisk until smooth. Dip doughnuts and serve immediately.\nFor the orange-cardamom glaze:\nPlace confectioners\u2019 sugar, cardamom, salt, and orange zest in medium bowl. Add orange juice and whisk until smooth. Dip doughnuts and serve immediately.\nFor the brown-butter glaze:\nMelt the butter over medium-high heat in a small stainless steel saucepan. Cook the butter until browned, 5 to 8 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally. The butter will begin to foam; the subsiding foam is an indicator that the butter is almost done. Once the solids are caramel brown remove pan from heat and immediately pour butter into a medium bowl, scraping in all the solids. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, salt, milk, and vanilla extract and whisk until smooth.
