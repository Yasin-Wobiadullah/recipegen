Season steaks generously with salt and pepper. Seal in individual vacuum-sealed bags, place in water bath or cooler, and close lid. Allow to cook for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. (If necessary, top up beer cooler with more boiling water to maintain temperature within 2 to 3\u00b0F of 127\u00b0F. See\nhere for more details on cooking sous vide using a beer cooler\n.)\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nRemove steaks from bag and pat dry with paper towels. Heat canola oil and butter in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until butter browns and begins to smoke. Add steaks and cook, without moving, for 30 seconds. Flip steaks and cook on second side for 1 minute. Meanwhile, blast top sides with a propane torch set on its hottest setting. Flip steaks and torch second side until well browned and charred in spots, about 30 seconds longer. Using tongs, stack steaks, lift and orient vertically, and hold against hot pan to crisp up fat all the way around the edges. Transfer steaks to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and allow to rest for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nWhen steaks have rested, add shallot, garlic, and herbs to skillet and increase heat to high. Cook until aromatic and lightly smoking, about 30 seconds. Pour hot pan drippings over steaks. Transfer steaks to a large serving plate and transfer drippings from resting pan into a small, warmed pitcher. Serve steaks immediately with pitcher of drippings on the side.\nSerious Eats / J.
