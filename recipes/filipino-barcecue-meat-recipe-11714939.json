Each piece of meat should touch the next, but do not push tightly together.\nWorking in batches if needed, grill, (covered for a gas grill) turning occasionally, until each side is nicely browned and the meat is cooked through, 6 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nMedium saucepan, 1-gallon zipper-lock bag, charcoal grill or gas grill, grilling tongs, 14 (12-inch) metal or wooden skewers pre-soaked in water for at least 30 minutes\nNotes\nIf using wooden skewers, soak skewers in water for at least 20 minutes before using.\nRead More\nHow to Stock A Filipino Pantry\nHow to Make Great Grilled Kebabs\n25 Filipino Recipes, Because We Can't Stop at Just One\nGrilled Chicken\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nFilipino\nGrilled Pork",
