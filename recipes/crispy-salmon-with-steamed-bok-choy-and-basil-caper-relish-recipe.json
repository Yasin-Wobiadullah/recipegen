Whisking constantly, add olive oil in a thin steady stream. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside\nPress salmon filets between paper towels to dry surfaces thoroughly. Season on all sides with salt and pepper.\nHeat oil in a large stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium low, then add one salmon filet, skin-side-down. Press firmly in place with the back of the spatula for 10 seconds to prevent the skin from buckling. Add the remaining filets one at a time, pressing each on until they are all in the pan.\nCook, pressing gently on back of filets occasinally to ensure good contact with skin, until skin releases easily from pan, about 4 minutes. If skin shows resistance when attempting to lift a corner with the spatula, allow it to continue to cook until it lifts easily. Continue to cook until salmon registers 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) in the very center for rare, 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) for medium-rare, or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium, 5 to 7 minutes total.\nFlip salmon filets and cook on second side for 15 seconds, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Set aside.\nMeanwhile, place bok choy on a large microwave-safe plate and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave on high power until just wilted, about 1 1/2 minutes. Carefully remove plastic (steam will burst out), season to taste with salt and pepper, then transfer to serving platter. Lay salmon on top skin side-up and spoon relish over the salmon. Serve immediately.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: How to Pan-Fry Salmon Fillets\nSalmon\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop Seafood\nBok Choy"
