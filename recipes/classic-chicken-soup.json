In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, cover chicken breasts, legs, and carcass with stock. Add garlic, thyme, and bay leaf.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nHeat stock over medium-high heat until temperature reaches between 150\u00b0F and 160\u00b0F (66 and 71\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer; adjust heat to maintain stock temperature in the 150\u00b0F\u2013160\u00b0F range. It's okay if the temperature bounces around a little, but try to keep it above 150 and below 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C). Cook until thickest part of chicken breasts registers 150\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour. Remove chicken breasts and set aside.\nBring soup to a simmer and continue cooking for 1 hour longer, skimming as needed. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Remove all chicken from pot. Pull meat from bones, shredding it into bite-size pieces; discard skin and bones. If broth is cloudy, you can strain it through a fine-mesh strainer to clarify it.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReturn all chicken to pot except breast meat and return to a simmer. Add diced carrot, turnip, onion (or leek), parsnip, and celery and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add minced fresh herbs and remove from heat. Dice chicken breasts and stir into soup along with any accumulated juices. Serve hot.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nor\nstockpot\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n(optional)\nNotes\nTo learn how to break down a whole chicken, check out\nour guide here\n.\nRead More\nClassic Chicken and Rice Soup\nPressure Cooker Chicken and Rice Soup\nThe Ultimate Chicken Noodle Soup\nSpicy Chicken Noodle Soup With Lime and Ginger\nYum Jin Gai (Spicy Northern Thai-Style Chicken Soup)\nKhao Piak Sen (Lao Chicken Noodle Soup)\nAvgolemono Soup (Greek Lemon-Egg Chicken Soup)\nSoups\nWhole Chicken\nChicken Mains\nComfort Food\nFall Mains"
