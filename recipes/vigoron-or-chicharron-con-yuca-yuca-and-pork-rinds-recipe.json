Season to taste with salt, adding more vinegar to taste. Refrigerate until needed.\nIf using fresh yucca, with a sharp chef\u2019s knife, cut off both ends of the yucca. Cut it crosswise into 4-inch long cylinders. With a sharp paring knife, score each piece vertically along its skin. Carefully insert the tip of the knife in the incision, moving it back and forth to peel the skin off. If the yucca skin is thin, you can try to peel it with a vegetable peeler.\nPlace yucca in large saucepan and cover with cold water. Add 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to boil over high heat, then, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until fork tender, 15 to 45 minutes (cooking time will depend on whether using fresh or frozen yucca).\nDrain yucca, and slice the pieces in half lengthwise. Remove and discard the woody strip in the center. Return to pot, and cover to keep warm.\nArrange 1 banana leaf (optional) on 4 to 6 appetizer plates. Distribute yucca evenly among plates and top with slaw and chicharrones. Serve.\nSpecial equipment\nchef\u2019s knife, paring knife, large saucepan, strainer\nSnacks & Appetizers\nSouth American\nPork",
