Alternatively, set all the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil grilling grate.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDry swordfish steaks well with paper towels and lightly brush them all over with oil.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSeason swordfish steaks all over with salt and, if desired, pepper, then set over hot side of grill. Cook swordfish until first side is well seared and the fish releases from the grill grate, about 5 minutes. If the fish sticks, try to gently lift it from below using a thin metal spatula or the tines of a carving fork inserted down between the grill grates. Turn fish and repeat on second side.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCook swordfish steaks until an instant-read thermometer registers 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium, 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for medium-well, or 140 to 145\u00b0F (60 to 63\u00b0C) for well-done. If the exterior is well seared before the interior of the fish reaches its final doneness, move steaks to cooler side of grill to finish cooking, flipping and rotating every minute or so for even cooking. Serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n,\ncharcoal chimney starter\n, grill brush, grilling spatula,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nBlack pepper is a spice and adds a specific flavor to the food you cook; salt, on the other hand, is an essential seasoning, necessary for food to taste its best. While we always use salt, we use black pepper only when we desire its specific flavor and aroma.\nRead More\nGrilled Blackened Fish Sandwiches\nSeafood Mains\nGrilled Seafood\nSwordfish\nEaster"
