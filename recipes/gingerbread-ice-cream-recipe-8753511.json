Whisk in cookie crumbs, cream, and milk. Cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes, until warm to the touch. Increase heat to medium, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, and cook until mixture is steaming hot and registers 155\u00baF (68\u00baC) on an instant-read thermometer,, about 8 minutes. Stir in liqueur and vanilla and season to taste with salt, black pepper, and/or additional spices if desired. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a large stainless steel bowl, pressing gently with a flexible spatula to release the liquid trapped in the crumbs.\nSet up an ice bath by filling a sink compartment or an extra-large bowl a combination of cold water and ice, and place bowl of custard inside, stirring from time to time, until cool, about 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), about 4 hours. Churn in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer.\nWhen ice cream looks thick and light, shut off the machine and scrape ice cream into chilled container, using chilled spatula. If desired, layer ice cream with chilled caramel sauce and an extra handful of crushed gingerbread cookies, in pieces as large or small as you like. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until hard, about 4 hours. Serve plain, with gingerbread cookies on the side, or as an \u00e0 la mode scoop for\ngingerbread cake\nor cherry pie.\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n, instant-read thermometer,\nnonreactive fine-mesh sieve\n, stainless steel mixing bowl, ice cream maker, nonreactive quart-sized freezer-safe container\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe ice cream base can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week until you're ready to churn. Once churned, the ice cream can be kept in the freezer for at least 1 month if well-protected from freezer burn.\nDesserts\nWinter\nChristmas\nChristmas Desserts\nWinter Desserts",
