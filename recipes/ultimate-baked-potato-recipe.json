  "full_text": "The Ultimate Baked Potato\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n60 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n80 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\n(\n12-ounce\n;\n340\ng\n)\npotatoes\n, preferably russets\nCanola, vegetable, or\nolive oil\n, for rubbing\n1\nstick\nunsalted butter\n(\n4\nounces\n;\n114\ng\n), diced\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\nToppings of your choice, such as grated cheddar cheese, crispy diced\nbacon bits\n, minced chives, sliced scallions, and/or sour cream\nDirections\nIf Using Only the Oven (see notes):\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Using a fork or paring knife, puncture potatoes in several spots. Rub each potato with a light coat of oil. Arrange on a rack set on a baking sheet, or directly on an oven rack, and bake until a fork can easily be inserted into the center of each potato, about 1 hour. If setting potatoes directly on oven rack, set a sheet of foil on the rack below to catch any oil drips.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nIf Using the Microwave and Oven (see notes):\nPreheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Using a fork or paring knife, puncture potatoes in several spots. Microwave potatoes for 5 minutes. Rub each potato with a light coat of oil. Arrange on a rack set on a baking sheet, or directly on an oven rack, and bake until a fork can easily be inserted into the center of each potato, about 20 minutes. If setting potatoes directly on oven rack, set a sheet of foil on the rack below to catch any oil drips.\nLet potatoes rest 5 minutes. Slice each open lengthwise and scoop flesh into a mixing bowl. Add butter, season with salt and pepper, and roughly mash, just until butter is incorporated but potatoes are still chunky.\nScoop mashed potatoes back into skins. (You can refill each skin, making 4 smaller potatoes, or use all the mashed potato to refill only half the skins, making 2 overstuffed potatoes.) Using your hands, reshape each stuffed potato back into a classic baked-potato shape.\nTop with toppings of your choice. To melt cheese, add it first, then return potatoes to oven until cheese melts, about 1 minute; alternatively, use a torch to melt cheese. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nBaking the potatoes in the oven produces marginally better results, but takes longer. The microwave speeds things up.\nRusset Potatoes\nGluten-free Sides\nRoasted Potatoes\nVegetable Sides"
