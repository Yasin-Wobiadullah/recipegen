The time will vary with the horsepower of your machine, so watch it like a hawk to avoid making fruity butter by mistake. Once mixture is thick and creamy, enjoy immediately or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nNotes\nThe exact volume of freeze-dried fruit can vary considerably by type and brand, so experimenting with fruits beyond those listed below is best done with a scale.\nDesserts\nNo-Cook Desserts\nBlueberry\nRaspberry\nHeavy Cream"
