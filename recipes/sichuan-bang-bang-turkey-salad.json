Add garlic, ginger, sugar, and sesame seeds, and pound to a rough paste, about 1 minute. Add vinegar, stock, sesame paste, and soy sauce, and pound to a smooth paste, 15 to 30 seconds. Stir in chile oil and sediment.\nIn a medium bowl, toss turkey with dressing and 3/4 of scallions until turkey is well-coated, adding extra stock as needed if turkey is too dry. Season to taste with salt. Transfer turkey to a serving bowl or individual serving plates, sprinkle with remaining scallions, more toasted sesame seeds, and additional chile oil if desired. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle\nNotes\nChile oil with sediment can be found in most Chinese supermarkets. Alternatively, make your own by toasting 1/4 cup (15g) of dried ground Sichuan or Thai chiles in a dry wok or saucepan until fragrant. Add 1/2 cup (120ml) of neutral oil like canola and heat until lightly bubbling. Immediately transfer to a cool heatproof container and let rest until cool. Chile oil can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator indefinitely.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dressing can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to three days. The salad is best enjoyed immediately, but it can be stored overnight in the refrigerator in an airtight container.",
