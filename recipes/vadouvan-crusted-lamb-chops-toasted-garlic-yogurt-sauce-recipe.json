Slide large cast iron skillet int broiler and heat for 15 minutes. While skillet is heating, combine olive oil, garlic, and rosemary in small saucepan and heat on lowest possible heat. Cook until garlic browns and smells toasty, about ten minutes, then remove from heat. Discard rosemary.\nIn large bowl, whisk together yogurt, egg white, and cornstarch until thoroughly combined. Slowly pour in olive oil, whisking constantly, until fully incorporated. Then transfer yogurt to pot and cook on lowest possible heat just until hot and slightly thickened, about five minutes. Stir in lemon juice and salt to taste and set aside. Sauce will continue to thicken, especially as it cools. Keep warm while preparing lamb chops.\nSkillet is hot enough when drop of water instantly evaporates from surface. Add lamb chops, leaving plenty of space between them, and broil until browned, three to four minutes. Flip over and broil until second side is well-browned, another three to four minutes. Lamb should register 135\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer for medium-rare. Remove chops and set aside to rest for five minutes, then serve immediately with yogurt sauce, dill, and additional sprinkle of vadouvan.\nSpecial equipment\ncast iron skillet\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Vadouvan, A Curry Powder for Every Pantry\nLamb"
