  "full_text": "Bi-Rite Creamery's Smooth and Mellow Chocolate Ice Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n5 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nChurning/Freezing Time\n6 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n6 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nMakes\n1 quart\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n5\nlarge\negg yolks\n3/4\ncup\nsugar\n1/4\ncup\nnatural cocoa powder\n, measured then sifted\n1\ncup\n1% or\n2% milk\n1 3/4\ncups\nheavy cream\n1/4\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\n1\nteaspoon\npure\nvanilla extract\nDirections\nFor the Base\n: In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the yolks just to break them up, then whisk in half of the sugar (6 tablespoons). Set aside.\nIn a heavy stainless steel pan, combine the cocoa powder with the remaining sugar (6 tablespoons). Whisk in about 1/4 cup of the milk to make a paste, adding a little more of the milk as needed to make it smooth and uniform. (If you add the milk all at once, it will be lumpy.) Whisk in the remaining milk, the cream, and salt and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the mixture approaches a bare simmer, reduce the heat to medium.\nCarefully scoop out about 1/2 cup of the hot cream mixture and, whisking the eggs constantly, add the cream to the bowl with the egg yolks. Repeat, adding another 1/2 cup of the hot cream to the bowl with the yolks. Returning to the pan of cream on the stove, use a heatproof spatula to stir the cream as you slowly pour the egg and cream mixture from the bowl back into the pan.\nContinue to cook the mixture carefully over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thickened, coats the back of a spatula, and leaves a clear mark when you run your finger across it, 1 to 2 minutes longer.\nStrain the base through a fine-mesh strainer and into a clean container. Set the container into an ice bath, wash your spatula, and use it to stir the base occasionally until it is cool. Then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate the base for at least 2 hours or overnight.\nTo Freeze\n: Add the vanilla to the base and stir until blended. Freeze in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. While the ice cream is churning, put the container you'll use to store the ice cream into the freezer. Enjoy right away or, for a firmer ice cream, freeze for at least four hours.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream machine\nIce Cream\nGluten-free Desserts\nChocolate\nHeavy Cream",
