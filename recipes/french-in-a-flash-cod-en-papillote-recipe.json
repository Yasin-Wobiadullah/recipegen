In the center of a large square of heavy duty foil, place 1 teaspoon butter. Season the fish with salt and pepper on both sides, and place on the butter. Top with a good amount of herbs, zest, white wine, and cr\u00e8me fraiche. Seal the bundle, and place on a baking sheet.\nBake for 15 minutes, and serve immediately. I like to serve it with crusty warm bread or plain boiled potatoes.\nNote:\nYou can get creative with herbs here, but if you don't know where to start, here are some of my favorite combinations:\nFennel fronds and chervil: Light and fresh and not intrusive.\nBasil and tarragon: Very summery.\nRosemary and thyme: Woodsy and autumnal.\nParsley and dill: Dill being a distinctive seafood herb, this is quite traditional.\nFennel fronds, chervil, parsley, marjoram, chives: What I used personally, proving that sometimes more is more.\nSeafood Mains\nFrench\nRoasted Seafood\nCod"
