Drain pasta, reserving 2 cups of liquid.\nWhile pasta is cooking, heat olive oil and butter in a 12-inch straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan over high heat until melted and beginning to brown. Add mushrooms and eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally until mushrooms have released all their moisture and the mushrooms and eggplant are well-browned, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add lemon juice and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.\nAdd cooked pasta to sauce, adding extra cooking liquid until sauce reaches desired consistency. Serve immediately with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.\nPastas\nItalian-American\nVegetarian Mains\nEggplant\nPortobello Mushrooms",
