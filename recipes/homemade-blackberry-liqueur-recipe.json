Blackberry juice can stain clothes and countertops, so be careful and clean up spills promptly.\nThe touch of lime zest adds another dimension to the liqueur and brings out the fresh tartness of the berries, but you can leave it out or substitute lemon zest, if desired.\nTo make simple syrup, combine 1 cup water with 1 cup sugar in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Cool before using.
