Add vanilla and beat just to incorporate.\nAdd flour mixture to butter mixture in three additions, alternating with buttermilk. Stir in white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts.\nScrape batter into prepared pan, making sure surface is even. Bake until cake tester inserted in cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar is dissolved. Dampen clean pastry brush with water and wipe down any sugar crystals from sides of pan. Boil mixture, swirling (but not stirring) pan occasionally, until sugar turns deep amber, 5 to 7 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and add cream and salt; mixture will bubble and sputter. Return to heat and stir over low heat until mixture is smooth.\nDrizzle salted caramel over cooled cake and cut into 16 or 24 pieces; serve.\nSpecial equipment\n17 1/4- by 11 1/2-inch jelly roll pan, electric mixer, rubber spatula, cooling rack\nThis Recipe Appears In\nLet Them Eat: White Chocolate-Macadamia Nut Sheet Cake\nDesserts\nSheet Cake\nNuts & Seeds",
