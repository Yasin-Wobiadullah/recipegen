Add lard and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water and process until a cohesive dough forms.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. Divide dough into 10 equal pieces; roll each piece of dough into a ball. Cover dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rest an additional 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nHeat cast iron skillet, griddle, or comal over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, place one ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface and pat down into a flat disc. Using a rolling pin, roll dough out to a very thin 8-inch round. Place dough in skillet and cook until bubbles form on top side and bottom side has light browned spots, 15-30 seconds. Flip tortilla and cook until second side develops light browned spots, 15-30 seconds longer. Transfer tortilla to a plate and cover with dish cloth. Repeat with remaining balls of dough. Serve immediately while still warm.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nNotes\nBack lard is preferable for its very mild pork flavor, although more neutral tasting leaf lard or vegetable shortening can be substituted for great results. The tortillas are best eaten fresh and while still warm. They can be stored in the refrigerator and reheated individually in a hot skillet or wrapped together in foil and placed in a warm oven.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nrolling pin\n,\ncast iron skillet\nBread\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nMexican\nDairy-free Sides",
