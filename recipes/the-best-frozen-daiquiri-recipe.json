  "full_text": "The Best Frozen Daiquiri\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nActive\n5 mins\nFreezing Time\n8 hrs\nTotal\n8 hrs 5 mins\nServes\n1 serving\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nounces\n(\n60\nml\n)\naged rum\n3/4\nounce\n(\n20\nml\n)\nfresh\u00a0juice\nfrom\n1\nlime\n3/4 to 1\nounce\n(\n20-30\nml\n) 1:1 turbinado\nsimple syrup\n(see notes)\nLime wheel\nand straw, for garnish (optional)\nDirections\nAt least 8 hours before you plan to serve the drink, add rum, 3/4 ounce lime juice, and 3/4 ounce turbinado simple syrup to a resealable container or zipper-lock bag. Place batched mix in freezer until freezer-cold, about 8 hours.\nWhen ready to serve, pour mix into blender and add 8 ice cubes or 160 grams crushed ice. Pulse blender 5 times, then blend until uniform. Taste and add up to 1/4 ounce additional turbinado simple syrup as needed. Blend once more briefly and serve immediately, with a lime wheel and straw if desired.\nIf you want to make multiple drinks, you can pre-batch up to a double recipe (a blender may not hold much more than that easily) in a single container, add 14 ice cubes, then divide after blending; if making more than two drinks, use separate containers to hold more servings.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nTo make turbinado simple syrup, combine equal volumes of turbinado sugar, such as Sugar in the Raw, and hot water in a tight-fitting resealable container such as a mason jar. Shake vigorously until sugar is completely dissolved; extra simple syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 month.\nOn a very hot day, you may want to add extra ice cubes to keep your daiquiri frozen longer.\nRead More\nThe Best Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri\nThe Best Rum for a Daiquiri\nHemingway Daiquiri\nClassic Margarita\nFrozen Drinks\nRum\nDrinks",
