Fold a 12- by 24-inch sheet of aluminum foil in half to form a square. Crimp two edges to form a pouch. Toss beets, vegetable oil, and salt and pepper to taste in a medium bowl until coated. Add to pouch and crimp remaining edge to seal. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Roast until beets are completely tender and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into beet through foil shows little to no resistance, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and allow to cool.\nCombine almonds, honey, vinegar, and shallots in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.\nWhen beets are cool enough to handle, peel by gently rubbing skin under cold running water. Cut beets into 1 1/2-inch chunks.\nToss beets, pomegranate, onion, and dressing together in a large bowl. Transfer to a plate. Garnish with goat cheese, boiled eggs, and celery leaves. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nMarcona almonds can be found in most specialty European-food shops. Regular almonds or pine nuts can be used in their place.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nRoasted Beet Salad with Goat Cheese, Eggs, Pomegranate, and Marcona Almond Vinaigrette\nHow to Roast Fall and Winter Vegetables | The Food Lab\nHow to Roast Beets\nBeets\nVegetarian Salads\nRoasted Vegetables\nGoat Cheese\nBoiled Eggs"
