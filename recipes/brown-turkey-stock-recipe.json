Drizzle turkey bones with oil, tossing to lightly coat. Arrange on 2 foil-lined rimmed baking sheets and roast until browned all over, about 45 minutes. (Check turkey often, since browning times can vary depending on the size and condition of the bones.)\nMeanwhile, in a large heavy-bottomed stockpot, heat 3 tablespoons (45ml) oil over high heat until shimmering. Add half of carrot, celery, onion, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned in spots, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate, add remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil, and repeat with remaining carrot, celery, onion, and garlic.\nLower heat to medium, return all cooked vegetables to pot, and add tomato paste. Cook, stirring, until tomato paste is fully mixed in, fragrant, and slightly darkened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nAdd roasted turkey bones, a few sprigs each of parsley and/or thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns.\nPour about 1/2 cup (120ml) hot water into each rimmed baking sheet and, using a metal spatula or wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits from aluminum foil. Pour into stockpot.\nAdd enough water to just barely cover all the solids in the pot, set over medium-high heat, and bring to a bare simmer. Lower heat to maintain a bare simmer and cook, occasionally skimming fat and scum from surface, until stock has reduced slightly and is deep and rich, 2 to 3 hours.\nStrain stock through a fine-mesh strainer, let cool, then transfer to containers and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 6 hours; discard solids. Skim off and remove any fat and scum on the surface of the stock. Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 6 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge heavy-bottomed stockpot\n,\nrimmed baking sheets\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nThe bones should include as much of the following as possible: breastbone, thigh and drumstick bones, wing bones, spine, and neck. This recipe can work with the bones from any size turkey; simply scale the aromatics and vegetables up or down depending on the turkey size, and add just enough water to cover.\nTurkey\nGluten-free\nRoasted Turkey\nThanksgiving\nWinter"
