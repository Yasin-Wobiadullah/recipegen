  "full_text": "Sous Vide City Ham With Balsamic Brown Sugar Glaze Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n3 hrs 20 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nResting Time\n5 mins\nTotal\n3 hrs 30 mins\nServes\n8\nto 12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nbone-in\nhalf ham\n(\n7 to 10\npounds\n;\n3.2 to 4.5\nkg\n), packing intact (see notes)\n1\ncup\n(about\n225\ng\n)\nbrown sugar\n1\ncup\n(\n240\nml\n)\nbalsamic vinegar\nDirections\nPreheat sous vide cooker to 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C). Add ham and cook for at least 3 hours and up to 8 hours. Meanwhile, heat brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until melted. Continue to cook until deep brown but not black, and immediately add all of balsamic vinegar, standing back as you add it. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved. Reduce to a bare simmer and continue to cook until mixture is thick and syrupy and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\nAdjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) 30 minutes before serving ham. Allow oven to preheat for 15 minutes. Remove ham from water bath, remove packaging, and place cut side down on a rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Wipe surface dry with paper towels and brush with glaze.\nPlace in oven and roast for 5 minutes. Pull out oven rack, apply another coat of glaze, and repeat. Repeat glazing step 2 more times. Remove ham from oven and let rest 5 minutes.\nTo carve ham, place cut side down on a cutting board and make a single slice right next to the bone, dividing ham in two. Place boneless side with the newly cut side facing down and slice thinly into serving pieces. Repeat with remaining ham, cutting it from the bone one section at a time before slicing it into serving portions.\nSpecial Equipment\nSous vide immersion circulator\n,\nrimmed baking sheet and wire rack\nNotes\nMost hams come in thick vacuum-sealed packaging that can be used for sous vide cooking. If not, seal your ham in a vacuum-sealed bag before cooking it sous vide.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Hams\nSous Vide Pork\nHam\nPork Mains\nEaster\nChristmas Dinners",
