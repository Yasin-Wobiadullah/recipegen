Add the onion and bell pepper. Saute until the onion is translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Raise the heat to high and add the beef. Cook, stirring constantly, to brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the cumin and cook for another minute.\nStir in the olives, raisins, honey, salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Cook until the meat is golden brown, the liquid has evaporated, and the flavors have blended, about 4 more minutes. Cool the mixture completely in the fridge. Stir in the egg whites.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Butter or line a baking sheet.\nTo form the empanadas, work with half of the disk of dough at a time, rolling out on a floured work surface. Using an overturned bowl (about 5 inches across), cut out circles about 3 or 4 at a time from each piece of dough. Gather all the dough scraps together, reroll once, and cut. Place 1/4 cup filling on one side of the dough circle. Wet the edges of the dough with water. Fold the dough over to form a half circle. Pinch the edges of the dough together. Crimp the edges with a fork. Repeat the process until all of the filling is used. The empanadas can be frozen at this point.\nPlace the empanadas on the prepared baking sheet and chill for a few minutes. Prick each pie on top twice with a fork. When ready to bake, beat the egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of water. Brush the egg wash over each empanada. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving. The empanadas can be cooled and frozen to reheat in a microwave.\nCream Cheese Pastry\n- makes about 10 pocket pies, or one double-crusted 10-inch pie -\nProcess the butter, cream cheese, and cream in a food processor, electric mixer or by hand to thoroughly combine.\nAdd the flour and salt. Process until just combined and the dough holds together in a ball. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Divide into 2 pieces. Flatten into disks and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before rolling out. If the dough is chilled overnight, take it out 15 minutes before rolling out.\nRub flour all over a rolling pin. Working with one dough disk at a time, pace the disk on a clean, well-floured work surface. Applying some pressure with the rolling pin, roll gently from the center of the dough to the top and bottom edges. Rotate the the disk, and roll to the top and bottom edges again. Reflour the work surface and rolling pin, turn the dough over, and continue to roll the dough from the center out to the edges. Turn over and roll again, rotating the disk to ensure even rolling until the dough is about 12 inches in diameter, thin but not transparent.\nHors D'Oeuvres\nPastries\nGround Beef"
