Place carrots in a large skillet and cover with cold water. Season gently with salt. Bring to a boil and cook until carrots are tender and water has mostly evaporated (If there's still lots of water left after the carrots are fully tender, drain.) Season cooked carrots with salt and pepper. Add thyme sprigs to pan, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, toss to coat, and transfer to oven. Roast, turning occasionally, until carrots are lightly caramelized and wrinkled in appearance, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, discard thyme, and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nFor the Duxelles:\nPlace mushrooms in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, about 12 minutes. Add shallots and garlic and cook, tossing and stirring, until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce and bourbon and cook until almost dry, about 2 minutes. Add breadcrumbs and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to a bowl.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIn a small bowl, toss bacon mushrooms with maple syrup until thoroughly coated. Roughly chop mixture and add to bowl with duxelles. Add half of parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil and fold mixture together until homogenous. Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nFor the Cashew-Bean Mixture:\nPlace cashews in a medium saucepan and add stock. Season very lightly with salt. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer cashews to the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpread beans on a foil or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet in an even layer. Transfer to oven and roast, stirring occasionally, until beans are mostly split open and outer skins are beginning to get crunchy, about 35 minutes. Transfer mixture to the work bowl of a food processor and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nMeanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until moisture evaporates and mushrooms are beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Add leeks and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, continuing to stir, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper and add to food processor work bowl.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nProcess dried beans and mushroom mixture until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with cashews. Transfer sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to work bowl of the food processor and pulse until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with bean/cashew mixture.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd remaining parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil to mixture and fold together. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTo Assemble:\nLay a single sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush with olive oil. (Make sure to keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Layer with about 1 1/2 cup bean/cashew mixture, leaving a 2-inch border all around.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nRoll the phyllo and stuffing up like a burrito, tucking in the sides about half way through rolling. Set the cigar-shaped roll aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nLay a clean sheet of phyllo on your work surface and brush with olive oil. Lay two more sheets on top, brushing each with olive oil as you layer them.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpread half of mushroom duxelles evenly over bottom two thirds of phyllo sheet, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Lay roasted carrots in even, parallel rows in the mushrooms and cover with remaining mushrooms, pressing down with clean hands to form an even layer. Place the cigar-shaped phyllo roll on top of the carrots and mushrooms.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nRoll the phyllo sheet up into a tight cylinder and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper and place remaining bean/cashew mixture on top of it in a rough 8-inch by 3-inch row. Lay a second sheet of parchment paper on top, followed by a second rimmed baking sheet. Press down firmly all over the baking sheet to spread mixture into a thin, even layer that will roughly fit on a piece of phyllo dough leaving a 2-inch border all around.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nRemove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment paper. Place a single layer of phyllo dough on top.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nBrush with olive oil, add another sheet of phyllo, and repeat, adding a total of 5 to 6 layers of phyllo and oil (Do not oil final sheet of phyllo.) Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of last phyllo sheet, place the second baking sheet on top, and holding both baking sheets together, invert the stack.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nRemove the top baking sheet and the top parchment. You should now have 6 layers of phyllo with a thin, even layer of bean/cashew mixture on top.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPlace the existing carrot/mushroom roll on top and roll up to secure. Set aside. Lay out a fresh sheet of phyllo and brush with olive oil. Place roll on top and roll up. Repeat, adding more layers of phyllo and olive oil until all of the phyllo is used up. Transfer roll, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush with more olive oil, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and score gently with a sharp paring knife at 1-inch intervals all the way across the top.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nBake until golden brown, crisp, and puffed, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.\nFor the Gravy:\nWhile roast is baking, make the gravy. Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk until flour is nutty brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in stock. Add soy sauce, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to 3 cups, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and lots of black pepper.\nTo Serve:\nTrim ends off of roast and discard. Carve roast at table, passing gravy alongside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, two (13- by 18 1/2-inch) rimmed\nbaking sheets\nNotes\nThis recipe requires you to first make\nSmoked Mushroom Bacon\nas well as\nHearty Vegetable Stock\n. Do not be tempted to use store-bought vegetable stock as it is universally poor quality. If you must use store-bought stock I suggest Better than Bouillon Organic Vegetable Base.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nThe roasted carrots, duxelles, and bean/cashew mixture can all be made up to three days in advance and stored in sealed zipper-lock bags in the refrigerator.\nRead More\nVegan Cream of Mushroom Soup With Crispy Shiitake Chips\nPasta With Vegan Chickpea Sauce\nCreamy Vegetarian Stuffed Mushrooms\nRoasted Vegetables\nChristmas\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nVegetable Mains",
