Refrigerate, stirring with a silicone spatula every 30 minutes, until fruit has macerated and sugar has completely dissolved, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, juice the zested lemon halves (You should have about 1 cup of lemon juice). Refrigerate juice in an airtight container until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen strawberries and lemon zest have macerated, stir in 3/4 cup (180ml) reserved lemon juice and 1 1/2 cups (355ml) water and refrigerate for another 30 minutes. Strain through a nonreactive fine-mesh strainer or piece of cheesecloth into a glass or ceramic container (you should have about 2 1/2 cups concentrate total). Cover and refrigerate the strawberry lemonade concentrate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor Serving:\nPour strawberry lemonade concentrate into a large pitcher. Stir in 5 cups cold water and garnish with lemon slices and strawberry slices, if using. Dilute with additional water and remaining 1/4 cup lemon juice to taste, if needed (see notes).\u00a0 Serve over ice.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nSilicone spatula, cheesecloth or nonreactive fine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nThe ratio of the strawberry lemonade concentrate to water is based on my personal taste preference to create my ideal balanced sweet and tart drink. Adjust with additional water and lemon juice to your own taste level, keeping in mind the lemonade will dilute further when served over ice.\nTo make one serving of finished strawberry lemonade, combine 1/2 cup strawberry lemonade concentrate with 1 cup of cold water, garnish, adjust with water and lemon juice to taste, and serve over ice.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe strawberry lemonade concentrate can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one week.\nLemon\nThe Latest\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nStrawberry\nDrinks",
