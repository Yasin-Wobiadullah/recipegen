  "full_text": "Cider-Braised Chicken With Apples, Bacon, and Sage Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n70 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nTotal\n80 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nwhole\nchicken legs\n(about\n2\npounds\n)\nKosher salt\nand\nfreshly ground black pepper\n3\nGranny Smith apples\n, peeled, cored, cut into 1/8-inch thick slices\n2\ntablespoons\nolive oil\n3\nslices\nbacon\n, finely chopped\n2\nmedium\nshallots\n, minced (about\n3\ntablespoons\n)\n2\ncups\nhard apple cider\n(see note)\n2\ntablespoons\nwhole-grain mustard\n3\nsprigs\nplus\n1\ntablespoon\nfresh sage leaves\n, divided\n1\ntablespoon\nheavy cream\n1\ntablespoon\nflour\nDirections\nPat chicken legs dry with paper towel and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place chicken into pot, skin side down, and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes (use oil screen if splattering). Turn over and cook another 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate and pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat.\nAdd apples and cook, stirring, until just softened and caramelized, about 5 minutes. Transfer apples to bowl and reserve. Add bacon and shallots to pot and cook until shallots have softened and bacon has rendered but not crisped, about 3 minutes (reduce heat if browning too quickly).\nWhisk in cider, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pot. Whisk in mustard, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper. Nestle chicken (skin side up) and sage sprigs into liquid, and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat to low, and gently simmer until chicken is cooked through and very tender, about 40 minutes (adjust heat to keep at gentle simmer).\nTransfer chicken to serving plate. Whisk cream into cooking liquid and simmer 1 minute. Transfer 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid to a small bowl and whisk in flour, then return to pot. Bring to a boil to thicken. Stir in apples and chopped sage, and season to taste. Serve with mashed potatoes or egg noodles.\nNotes\nI used a medium-dry 4.5% ABV hard apple cider. For an alcohol-free substitute, use 3/4 cup apple cider and 1 1/4 cups chicken broth. Serve this dish with mashed potatoes or egg noodles.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Legs\nApple\nBacon\nSage",
