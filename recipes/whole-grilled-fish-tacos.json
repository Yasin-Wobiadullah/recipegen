Season generously with salt and pepper and stir to combine. Rub fish all over with mixture. Stuff fish with lime or lemon slices and whole sprigs of cilantro. Set aside.\nCombine minced cilantro, scallions, serrano or jalape\u00f1o, remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil, and remaining tablespoon (15ml) lemon or lime juice in a medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Combine diced cucumber with pico de gallo and set aside.\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes.\nClean and oil\ngrilling grate.\nSet fish over hot side of grill and cook until bottom side is browned, about 5 minutes. Using a carving fork, insert tines between grill grate and under fish. Carefully attempt to lift fish from below; if it resists, allow to cook for 1 more minute and try again. When fish lifts easily from grill, turn onto other side and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C), about 5 minutes longer. If skin begins to char before fish is cooked through, transfer fish to cooler side of grill to finish cooking. Let rest 5 minutes. While fish cooks, warm corn tortillas directly over hot side of grill, flipping them as soon as they start to char slightly and stacking them under a kitchen towel as they finish cooking in order to keep them moist.\nTransfer fish to a serving platter and spoon scallion/cilantro mixture on top. Garnish with cucumber slices and lemon or lime wedges. Serve immediately with hot tortillas and cucumber pico de gallo. Diners should make their own tacos, picking the meat out of the fish and topping with pico de gallo and lime as they go.\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nHow to Grill Whole Fish\nHow to Shop for Sustainable Seafood\nHow to Get Started Grilling\nThe GrillGrate: An Upgrade Almost Every Gas Grill Needs\nClassic Pico de Gallo Recipe\nGrilled Seafood\nMexican\nGluten-free Mains\nGrilled Fish\nFish"
