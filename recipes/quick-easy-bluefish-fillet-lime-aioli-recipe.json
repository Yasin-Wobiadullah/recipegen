Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.\nMeanwhile, in a mortar and pestle, combine garlic with a pinch of salt and work into a paste. In a medium bowl, whisk together garlic paste, lime zest, egg yolk, lime juice, mustard, and chili powder. Whisking constantly, drizzle in canola and extra-virgin olive oils in a slow, steady stream to form a thick, emulsified sauce. Season aioli with salt and pepper. Alternatively, using a blender, blend garlic with egg yolk, lime juice, mustard, and chile powder; then drizzle in canola oil in a thin, steady stream until a thick, emulsified sauce forms. Whisk in olive oil (do not add olive oil in blender) and season with salt and pepper.\nPat bluefish fillets dry with paper towels and arrange on baking sheet. Using an offset spatula or butter knife, spread aioli evenly all over fillets. Bake until bluefish reaches 135\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, about 7 minutes. Remove from oven and turn on broiler.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBroil bluefish until lightly browned and bubbling on top and an instant-read thermometer registers 140\u00b0F when inserted in center, about 4 minutes. Transfer bluefish to plates, sprinkle with parsley, and serve with lime wedges.\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle or blender, rimmed baking sheet,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nBlending olive oil at high speeds can often result in bitterness, which is why we recommended hand-whisking in the oil in Step 2.\nRead More\nWhole Roasted Branzino With Tangerine-Fennel Vinaigrette\nBroiled Whole Porgy With Blistered Shishito and Tomato\nThe Easiest Crispy Pan-Seared Fish\nDoes Blending Olive Oil Make It More Bitter?\nFish\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nRoasted Seafood\nLime",
