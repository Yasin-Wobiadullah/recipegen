When mixture is about to boil, remove from heat and cover. Let it sit for a minimum of 3 hours and no more than 12 hours.\nSerious Eats / Liz Clayman\nStrain steeped mixture through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a bowl, squeezing the cloth as you go.\nSerious Eats / Liz Clayman\nAdd orange flower water and vodka, then stir. Funnel into a glass jar or bottle.\nSerious Eats / Liz Clayman\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nor\nfood processor\n, cheesecloth\nNotes\nStore in the refrigerator, for no more than one month.\nThis orgeat is darker in color than some other recipes because the skins are left on the almonds. I like the richer color and extra almond flavor this adds. If you prefer a sweeter, milky-white orgeat, use blanched almonds. Since there are oils in almonds, the syrup will separate. Shake before each use.\nOrange flower water can be found at some grocery stores and Mediterranean markets, as well as online.\nAlmonds\nCocktails",
