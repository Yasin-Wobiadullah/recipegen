Split pumpkins in half with a heavy chef's knife or cleaver. Scoop out seeds and discard or save for another use. Rub pumpkins on all surfaces with oil and season with salt and pepper. Place cut-side-down on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Scatter whole thyme stems on top. Roast until completely tender, flipping halfway through cooking, 1 to 1 1/2 hours total. Remove from oven and let rest until cool enough to handle.\nMeanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add leeks and onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add stock, bay leaves, and maple syrup and bring to a simmer.\nUsing a large spoon, scoop flesh out of pumpkin and add it to the pot. Discard stem and skins. Let simmer for 15 minutes longer, then remove bay leaves and discard.\nPur\u00e9e soup in a blender in batches until completely smooth, straining through a fine-mesh strainer to catch any particles or fibers. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper.\nTo serve, heat remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a small skillet over medium heat, swirling constantly, until foam subsides and butter takes on a deep brown color with a nutty aroma, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and add remaining tablespoon thyme leaves (they'll crackle as they hit the hot butter). Add lemon juice and season brown butter to taste with salt.\nLadle soup into serving bowls and drizzle with thyme brown butter. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nblender\n,\nDutch oven\nRead More\nCurried Pumpkin Soup\nClassic Butternut Squash Soup\nSerious Entertaining: A Blowout Christmas Dinner\nSerious Entertaining: A Comforting Vegetarian Dinner\nSoups\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nRoasted Vegetables\nPumpkin\nThanksgiving Appetizers"
