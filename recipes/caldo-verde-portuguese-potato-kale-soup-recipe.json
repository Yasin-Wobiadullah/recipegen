Add kale and continue to cook until russet potato slices have completely broken down (you can press them with a spoon or potato masher for an even thicker texture), the Yukon Golds are tender, the greens have softened, and the soup has thickened to a creamy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in sausage. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper and serve garnished with chives, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nor\nlarge saucepan\nNotes\nYou can make this soup vegetarian by using\nvegetable stock\nin place of chicken stock and omitting the sausage.\nRead More\nPortuguese Garlic and Cilantro Bread Soup (A\u00e7orda \u00e0 Alentejana)\nEasy Creamy Potato, Leek, and Sauerkraut Soup\nSouthern European\nSouthern European\nBraised & Stewed Sausages\nKale\nYukon Gold Potatoes"
