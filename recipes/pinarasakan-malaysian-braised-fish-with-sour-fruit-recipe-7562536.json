(Pan should be large enough to accommodate the fish without overcrowding.) Add the tamarind and water, then stir until the salt dissolves, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nAdd the fish to the pan, arranging them in a single layer (do not stack the fish on top of each other). Bring to a simmer, then cover the pan and reduce heat to low. Cook the fish, undisturbed, until most of the water has cooked off and a concentrated gravy remains, about 45 minutes. Uncover the pan for the last 15 minutes so that the gravy almost dries out. Turn off the heat and leave the fish in the covered pan until ready to serve. This will help prevent the fish from drying out too much and sticking to the pan.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nTransfer fish to a plate and serve family-style alongside steamed white rice.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch nonstick pan with lid\nNotes\nAny small, oily fish can be used to make pinarasakan. If using larger fish, bone-in steaks are much more preferable over fillets.\nIf the gravy is runny after 45 minutes, remove the fish to a platter and heat the sauce over high heat until thickened, about 2 minutes.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPinarasakan can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nMalaysian\nThe Latest\nSoutheast Asian\nFish"
