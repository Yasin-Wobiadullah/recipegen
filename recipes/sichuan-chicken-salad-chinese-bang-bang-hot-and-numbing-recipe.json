Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIf Cooking in a Sous-Vide Precision Cooker\n: Preheat a sous-vide cooker to 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C). Add chicken and cook for at least 1 hour and up to 4. Transfer to an ice bath and let chill for 15 minutes.\nIf Cooking in a Cooler\n: Heat 2 quarts of water in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it registers 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer to a small cooler, add chicken, and seal cooler. Cook for at least 1 hour and up to 4, topping up with boiling water as necessary to maintain temperature of 150\u00b0F. Transfer to an ice bath and let chill for 15 minutes.\nWhile chicken cooks, grind Sichuan peppercorns in a mortar and pestle until a rough powder is formed. Add sugar, remaining 3 cloves garlic, and sesame seeds and pound until a rough paste is formed. Add sesame paste, soy sauce, and vinegar and pound until a smooth paste is formed. Stir in chile oil and sediment. Set dressing aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nWhen chicken is cooked, remove from bags and discard garlic, scallions, and ginger. Stir 2 tablespoons of juices from the bag into the dressing. Remove skin and bones from chicken and discard. Shred meat and transfer to a large bowl. Add dressing and sliced scallions.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nToss chicken to coat in dressing and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, sprinkled with more scallions and sesame seeds and drizzled with additional chile oil if desired.\nSerious Eats /J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nSous vide precision cooker\nor a small beer cooler\nNotes\nChile oil with sediment can be found in most Chinese supermarkets. Alternatively, make your own by toasting 1/4 cup of dried ground Sichuan or Korean chiles in a dry wok until fragrant. Add 1/2 cup of neutral oil like canola and heat until lightly bubbling. Immediately transfer to a cool pot and let rest until cool. Chile oil can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator indefinitely.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's Complete Guide to Sous Vide Chicken Breast\nChinese\nChicken Breast\nSous Vide Chicken\nChicken Salad"
