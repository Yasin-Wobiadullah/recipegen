Beat in egg and vanilla. Add dry ingredients and beat just until dough is evenly combined. Used a rubber spatula to fold in raisins.\nScrape batter into prepared dish and use spatula to smooth the top. Bake until golden brown on top and set in the middle, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes then release from springform pan. Let cool completely.\nFor Icing\n: In a small bowl, whisk together confectioners sugar and heavy cream until smooth. Drizzle over pie. Serve.\nNotes\nI used a springform pan to make getting the pie out easier, but you can also use a deep dish 9-inch pie plate. This doesn't make enough icing to cover the pie, just to give a thick drizzle.\nSpecial Equipment\n9-inch pie plate or springform pan, electric mixer\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCookie Monster: Iced Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Pie\nCookies\nNorth American\nPies\nFall Desserts"
