Toast until chunks turn golden brown, 10 to 20 minutes. (Keep your eyes on them.)\nIn a large saucepan over medium heat, bring cream and milk to a simmer. Stir in toasted panettone chunks, cover, and let steep for 1 hour.\nPour bread and dairy mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on bread with a wooden spoon or spatula to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Measure out 2 cups of panettone-infused dairy and reserve the rest for another use.\nIn a clean, heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk egg yolks together with sugar until very well combined, pale yellow in color, and slightly thick. Slowly pour in panettone-infused dairy, whisking constantly, then bring saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until a custard forms on the back of a spoon and a finger swiped across the back leaves a clean line, or until custard reaches 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C).\nPour custard through a fine-mesh strainer into an airtight container and chill overnight (or until ice cream base falls below 40\u00b0F or 4\u00b0C). The next day, churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer ice cream to airtight container and chill in freezer for at least 4 to 5 hours before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nThis recipe also works with leftover brioche, croissants, and other rich breads.\nRead More\nBanana Bread Ice Cream\nZucchini Bread Ice Cream\nMeet the Italian Ice Cream Sandwich: Brioche Con Gelato\nIce Cream\nChristmas Desserts",
