Pulse until the butter disappears, about 30 seconds, then add water and continue processing until dough rides up on the blade and forms a silky but stringy dough. This will take about 2 minutes, but the timing will vary depending on the size and horsepower of the food processor. Transfer to a lightly greased bowl, cover tightly, and allow the dough to relax at least 2 hours at room temperature, or up to 24 hours at cool room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Filling:\nIn a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt until well combined. Whisk in egg, yolk, and milk. Once smooth, place over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly but gently until warm to the touch, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium and cook, now whisking quite vigorously, until the custard begins to thicken, about 2 minutes more. The custard may seem lumpy, almost like cottage cheese, but continue whisking until emulsified and silky smooth.\nWhen the thick custard begins to bubble, set a timer and continue cooking and whisking for exactly 1 minute. (This step helps neutralize a starch-dissolving enzyme found in egg yolks.) Off heat, stir in vanilla extract, lemon zest, and cinnamon. Pour the custard onto a large plate or pie dish to form a thin layer (this will speed the cooling process), then press a sheet of plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until thick and cool, about 1 hour, or to a temperature of 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C). Alternatively, refrigerate the custard up to one week and then return to room temperature until warmed to approximately 68\u00b0F.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cool pudding until creamy and smooth (this can also be done by hand using a flexible spatula, although it may seem impossible at first). Fold in the ricotta. Refrigerate in an airtight container until needed, up to 3 days.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPreparing the Dough:\nTurn the soft dough onto a well floured surface and, using as much flour as needed to prevent sticking, roll until approximately 1/16 inch thick. Brush excess flour from the dough, then lightly brush the surface with egg white. Carefully fold the dough in half, then dust with more flour and continue rolling to 1/16 inch. Gently lift the dough to make sure it hasn't stuck, then cut into 3 1/2-inch rounds; re-roll the scraps and cut as before.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPreparing the Oil:\nMelt the refined coconut oil (or other solid fat) in a 5-quart stainless steel or enameled Dutch oven. Clip on a digital thermometer and warm to 360\u00b0F (182\u00b0C) over medium heat. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with 3 layers of paper towels, and form the shells.\nTo Form the Shells:\nLightly grease the cannoli forms with pan spray or oil, then place each onto a round of prepared dough. Wrap the dough around the cannoli form, using a bit of egg white to firmly seal the flaps together where they overlap. (The dough should be comfortably secure around the form, neither too tight, as it will make the forms difficult to remove after frying, nor too loose, as this will allow the dough to slide free.)\nTo Fry:\nWorking with three or four at a time, carefully lower the prepared cannoli forms into the hot oil and fry until the dough is blistered and pale gold, about 2 minutes. If any sink to the bottom (due to the weight of the forms), prevent them from burning by moving the cannoli from time to time with a pair of kitchen tweezers or tongs. When golden, lift the cannoli by the shell itself (rather than the slippery forms), and transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet.\nWhile hot, use the kitchen tweezers or tongs to rap the tapered end of the form against the tray so the pastry shell slides free. Set the forms aside to cool, then re-use as before to form and fry the remaining dough. Cool the shells to room temperature and use immediately, or store up to 1 week in an airtight container. If using liquid fry oil, the shells cannot be prepared in advance.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Serve:\nTransfer the prepared ricotta filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain round tip. Insert the tip of the pastry bag into a pastry shell until it reaches the middle; begin piping with steady pressure and slowly draw the tip from the tube. When you reach the edge of the shell, stop piping, then move the pastry tip away. Repeat on the opposite side, and fill the remaining cannoli shells the same way. Dip one or both ends of the filled cannoli into dishes of chopped chocolate and pistachio pieces, if desired. Enjoy immediately, or cover in plastic and refrigerate up to 4 hours (this will only work for shells fried in refined coconut oil; shells fried in liquid oil cannot be held more than a few moments).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nrolling pin\n, 3 1/2-inch round cutter, two pastry brushes, tapered, carbon steel cannoli forms,\nclip-on digital thermometer\n,\nheavy duty kitchen tweezers\nor\nstainless steel tongs\n,\ndisposable pastry bag\n, a plain, 1/2-inch round tip\nNotes\nCannoli are little more than edible serving vessels for ricotta, so don't settle for crappy supermarket brands chock full of gums, stabilizers, preservatives, or other additives. Their chalky flavor and squeaky mouthfeel won't magically improve in the filling, so if you can't find something that's outrageously good by the spoonful, cannoli are doomed to mediocrity. If at all possible, look for small, local producers in your area (at Serious Eats, we love\nSalvatore Bklyn\n), but national brands like Sorrento or Calabro will do in a pinch.\nPastries\nItalian-American\nDesserts\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nCookies"
