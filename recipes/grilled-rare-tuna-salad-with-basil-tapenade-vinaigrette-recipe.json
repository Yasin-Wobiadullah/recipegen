Season the tuna liberally with salt, pepper, and herbes de Provence. Rub 1 tablespoon of olive oil all over the outside of the seasoned fish. Grill without until lightly seared and grill marks appear about 30 seconds. Flip and repeat on second side. Set aside.\nHeat 1-inch of oil in a small saucepan until shimmering. Carefully add the capers (they will splatter) and fry until crisp and golden, about 1 minute. Drain on paper towel. (You can also just add the capers as they are, without frying).\nTo make the vinaigrette, whisk together 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the tapenade, vinegar, garlic, sliced basil leaves, and salt and pepper.\nTo assemble the salad, arrange the tomatoes on the bottom of a serving dish. Scatter the lettuce on top, and then some whole basil leaves. Slice the tuna about 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick, and arrange over the lettuce and basil. Drizzle the vinaigrette all over, and crown with the capers. Serve the lemon quarters on the side.\nSalads\nTuna"
