Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool completely to room temperature. Place the chicken in a nonreactive container and pour the cooled brine over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 12 hours. Drain the chicken, discarding any solids, and pat dry with paper towels.\nFry the chicken:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, generously applying to ensure that the mixture sticks to the chicken. Prepare a deep-fryer or fill a 6-quart pot halfway with the oil and heat to 325\u00b0F. Set a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and set aside. Carefully drop the thighs into the oil and fry until crispy and cooked through, 8 to 9 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to the rack, cool to room temperature, and then refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours.\nMake the salad:\nChop the chicken into small pieces and reserve. In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, shallots, celery, mustard, herbs, red pepper flakes, and vinegar. Season with salt, pepper, and more vinegar to taste. Gently fold the chicken into the dressing until incorporated. Serve with rolls, lettuce, and pickles.\nSpecial equipment\nCandy or deep-fry thermometer\nChicken Salad\nFried Chicken\nChicken Thighs",
