Mix well and set aside. Open the package of noodles and loosen them in a large bowl. Separate any noodle strands that are clumped together.\nHeat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add the tofu, spread it out, and cook without moving until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Add remaining tablespoon of soy sauce, mix, and add in the chives. Stir-fry until chives are bright green, about 1 minute, then transfer to a bowl and set aside.\nHeat remaining 2 tablespoons in now-empty wok over high heat until smoking. Add the noodles. Using tongs or long chopsticks, spread the noodles around, toss them in the oil, and make sure they are not in one big clump. Cook, stirring, until they start to get a little bit crispy, about 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce mixture and continue stirring and mixing the noodles around. It is important that you keep the noodles moving once you add the sauce. Once the noodles are combined with the sauce, add the bean sprouts and the carrots. Continue tossing until the bean sprouts begin to turn transparent, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add the scallions, tofu, and chives back to the wok. Toss until everything is combined. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nWok\nNotes\nHong Kong-style noodles come pre-cooked. If using raw wonton noodles, boil in salted water for 45 seconds, rinse under cool running water, drain carefully, toss with 1 tablespoon oil, and arrange on a tray and allow to dry for 1 hour before stir-frying.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nChinese Noodles 101: How to Make Chow Mein With Four Vegetables\nChinese Noodles 101: The Chinese Egg Noodle Style Guide\nChinese\nChinese-American\nVegetarian Mains\nStir-Fry Noodles\nNoodles"
