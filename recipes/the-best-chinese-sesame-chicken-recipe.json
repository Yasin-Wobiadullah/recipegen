Add soy sauce, wine, and vodka and whisk to combine. Set aside half of marinade in a small bowl. Add baking soda and cornstarch to the large bowl and whisk to combine. Add chicken to large bowl and turn with fingers to coat thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.\nFor the Dry Coat:\nCombine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk until homogenous. Add reserved marinade and whisk until mixture has coarse, mealy clumps. Set aside.\nFor the Sauce:\nCombine soy sauce, wine, vinegar, chicken stock, sugar, sesame seed oil, and cornstarch in a small bowl and stir with a fork until cornstarch is dissolved and no lumps remain. Set aside.\nCombine oil, garlic, ginger, and minced scallions in a large skillet and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are aromatic and soft, but not browned, about 3 minutes. Stir sauce mixture and add to skillet, making sure to scrape up any sugar or starch that has sunk to the bottom. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute. Add half of sesame seeds. Transfer sauce to a bowl to stop cooking, but don't wipe out skillet.\nTo Finish:\nHeat 1 1/2 quarts peanut, vegetable, or canola oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and adjust flame to maintain temperature.\nWorking one piece at a time, transfer chicken from marinade to dry coat mixture, tossing in between each addition to coat chicken. When all chicken is added to dry coat, toss with hands, pressing dry mixture onto chicken so it adheres, and making sure that every piece is coated thoroughly.\nLift chicken one piece at a time, shake off excess coating, and carefully lower into hot oil (do not drop it). Once all chicken is added, cook, agitating with long chopsticks or a metal spider, and adjusting flame to maintain a temperature of 325 to 375\u00b0F (163-190\u00b0C), until chicken is cooked through and very crispy, about 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined bowl to drain.\nAdd chicken to empty skillet and return sauce to skillet. Toss chicken, folding it with a rubber spatula until all pieces are thoroughly coated. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds and serve immediately with white rice and steamed broccoli.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nor\nDutch oven\nfor deep frying\nNotes\nShaoxing wine can be found in most Asian markets. If unavailable, dry sherry can be used in its place.\nIf you can't find boneless skinless chicken thighs, you can\ndebone them yourself using this guide\n.\nRead More\nChinese-American Orange Chicken\nThe Best General Tso's Chicken\nChicken Stir-Fry\nChinese-American\nFried Chicken\nChicken Thighs\nChicken Mains",
