Using a flexible rubber spatula, scrape down sides and bottom of the bowl. Add mascarpone cheese and beat on medium-high speed until incorporated and fluffy, about 45 seconds. Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl, and add pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy and no lumps remain, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a large bowl; do not clean stand mixer bowl or whisk attachment.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nBeat cream in same stand mixer bowl on medium-high speed with whisk attachment until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, add about 1/3 of the whipped cream to mascarpone mixture and gently fold until combined. Add remaining whipped cream and gently fold until no streaks remain.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nWorking one at a time, dip 24 ladyfingers into coffee mixture, rotating fully to coat and giving it two or three seconds to absorb the liquid, then transfer to a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. (See notes.) Arrange soaked ladyfingers in a single layer, breaking or trimming ladyfingers as needed to fit neatly. Top with half of the mascarpone mixture (about 3 1/2 cups), and, using a flexible or offset spatula, spread into an even layer. Repeat with remaining ladyfingers, then top with remaining mascarpone mixture and spread until smooth.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nIn a small bowl, whisk ground cinnamon and instant espresso powder to combine. Using a fine mesh sieve, lightly dust top of tiramisu with cinnamon and espresso mixture. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 3 days; serve cold.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer, 9- by 13-inch baking dish\nNotes\nDo not submerge ladyfingers in coffee mixture; dipping should take no longer than 3 seconds for each biscuit.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTiramisu can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.\nFall Desserts\nThe Latest\nDesserts\nFall\nPumpkin",
