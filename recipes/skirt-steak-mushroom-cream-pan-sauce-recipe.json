Divide steaks between skillets and sear, turning frequently, until well browned on both sides and an instant-read thermometer registers 120 to 125\u00b0F (49 to 52\u00b0C) for medium-rare, about 7 minutes. Transfer steaks to a plate and keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDivide remaining 2 tablespoons oil between the skillets and heat until shimmering. Add half the mushrooms to each skillet and cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until mushrooms have released their liquid and it has cooked off, about 6 minutes. Add half the shallots, garlic, and thyme to each skillet and continue cooking, stirring, until mushrooms are browned and shallots are softened and lightly golden, about 7 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper.\nAdd half the wine to each skillet and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up any browned bits. Scrape the contents of 1 skillet into the other and continue cooking until wine has evaporated, about 6 minutes. Add stock and reduce by half, about 4 minutes. Add cream, bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer. Simmer until slightly reduced and the sauce has thickened slightly.
