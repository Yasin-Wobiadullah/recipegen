Knead with the dough hook until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add the salt, garlic powder, parsley, and olive oil and continue kneading until everything is incorporated, about 2 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 45 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees. Flour your work surface, turn out the dough, and form it into a rough rectangle. Roll the dough to a rectangle about 10x20 inches, trying to keep it an even thickness.\nCut the dough into 1/2 wide strips, 10 inches long. Pick up the strips one at a time, twist each into a spiral, and lay them on baking sheets, leaving room between them. They'll stretch a little as you twist them - that's fine.\nWhen all the bread sticks are on the sheets, bake at 300 degrees until they are nicely browned and crisp, about 40 minutes. Let them cool completely on a rack.\nYeast Breads\nVegan\nGarlic\nHerbs"
