Add pepperoni and cook, stirring, until pepperoni begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Add pepper flakes and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add parsley and chives and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in Parmesan cheese. Do not wipe out skillet.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nOn a lightly floured surface, divide dough into 2 even pieces. Working one piece at a time, roll or stretch into an oblong about 8 inches long and 4 inches wide. With a bench scraper or knife, cut crosswise into 12 strips. Repeat with other half of dough.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nTie each strip into a knot and transfer to bowl with pepperoni/garlic mixture. Toss and fold with your hands until every knot is thoroughly coated in mixture. Transfer the knots to the skillet in a single layer. Drizzle with more olive oil, cover tightly with plastic, and set aside until doubled in size, about 4 hours. Alternatively, refrigerate until doubled in size, 12 to 16 hours.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nWhen ready to bake, preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) and adjust oven rack to center position. Unwrap garlic knots. Sprinkle with Romano cheese. Transfer to oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes.\nRemove from oven and immediately brush with more extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle lightly with more Parmesan. Serve right away with warmed sauce on the side.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch cast iron skillet\nNotes\nBecause of how intensely flavored these garlic knots are, this is one case where store-bought dough (which is often under-seasoned) works just as well as homemade. So feel free to take the easy road here and use pre-made pizza dough\u2014you won't be sacrificing any flavor.\nYeast Breads\nItalian-American\nGarlic\nPizza\nSides"
