Add wine and heat until steaming. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss together both cheeses with cornstarch until evenly coated.\nSerious Eats / Niki Achitoff-Gray\nWorking over low heat, add cheese a handful at a time, stirring until mostly melted before adding next handful. Continue until all cheese is melted into the wine, forming a smooth, glossy melted cheese sauce, about 10 minutes; it is very important that the fondue stay below a simmer once you start adding the cheese, or there's a risk it could break. Stir in lemon juice and kirsch, if using, until fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. If not already in a fondue pot, transfer fondue to a fondue pot to keep it warm and melted at the table. Serve with toasted bread cubes and lightly blanched vegetables for dipping. If fondue begins to thicken too much, add a small splash of wine to loosen it.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFondue pot\nRead More\nThe Science of Melting Cheese\nFor Smooth, Stable Cheese Sauces, Cornstarch and Evaporated Milk Are Your Friends\nPommes Aligot (Cheesy Mashed Potatoes)\nIrish Cheddar Fondue With Stout and Whiskey\nVegetarian Mains\nGruyere\nMother's Day\nFather's Day\nChristmas Dinners"
