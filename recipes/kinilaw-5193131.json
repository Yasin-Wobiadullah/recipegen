Using clean hands or a spoon, gently fold until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 minutes and up to 15 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nSet a fine-mesh strainer inside a medium bowl, and drain fish mixture; discard excess liquid. Transfer kinilaw to a serving bowl, sprinkle with chives or scallions and edible flowers (if using), and serve immediately.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nYou can substitute Thai chiles with 1 jalape\u00f1o pepper.\nSpiced coconut vinegar, also known as sinamak, can be found in Asian markets and online (it can also be labeled as pinakurat, which is an extra-spicy version). If you can\u2019t find coconut vinegar, spiced cane vinegar is an acceptable substitute and can be found in Asian markets or online.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nKinilaw is best enjoyed immediately; extended marination will cause the fish to turn chalky and eventually break down as the spiced coconut vinegar will continue to denature its proteins, essentially \u201covercooking\u201d it.\nFilipino\nTuna\nNo-Cook Seafood\nThe Latest",
