Return warmed tortilla to a cloth towel or tortilla warmer to ensure it remains warm and pliable. Repeat with remaining tortillas.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nTo Form Burritos:\nWorking with 1 tortilla at a time, set tortilla on a work surface and spoon 3 heaping tablespoons of machaca guisada in center, piling it so that it forms a 2 1/2- by 1-inch horizontal mound.\nUsing your hands, fold the left and right sides up and over the filling, then roll the tortilla from the bottom up to form a small burrito-like package. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.\nServe burritos while still warm with the lime wedges and cucumber slices on the side.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe burritos are best made right before serving.\nRead More\n13 Burrito Styles Everyone Should Know\nHomemade Machaca (Northern Mexican Dried Beef)\nBeef Mains\nMexican\nQuick Dinners"
