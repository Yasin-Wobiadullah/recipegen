Drain pasta, reserving 1 1/2 cups (360ml) cooking water.\nMeanwhile, in a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add shallots, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until shallots are softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened as well, about 2 minutes longer.\nAdd cherry tomatoes, shaking skillet to distribute them in an even layer, and cook, stirring and swirling the pan frequently, until tomatoes begin to burst, about 5 minutes. You can coax the tomatoes into bursting by pressing down on them with a wooden spoon, but leave some tomatoes whole for juicy pops of flavor in the finished dish.\nContinue to cook and stir tomato mixture until it forms a creamy, emulsified sauce, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Add XO sauce and ground dried chiles (if using), stir to combine, and season to taste with salt.\nAdd pasta and half of the reserved cooking water (3/4 cup; 180ml) to skillet with cherry tomato sauce. Increase heat to high and cook, swirling and tossing skillet constantly, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and coats noodles, about 1 minute. If the sauce over-reduces (it should pool around the edges of the skillet), add more pasta-cooking water in 1/4-cup increments to loosen it.\nRemove from heat, stir in basil and mint, and season to taste with more salt. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet\nNotes\nXO sauce packs a healthy amount of spicy background heat on its own, but an extra pinch of ground dried chiles or red pepper flakes will give the sauce more punch. Adjust the heat level of the sauce to your liking. For a milder tomato sauce, you can omit the dried chiles entirely.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis pasta dish comes together really quickly and is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nXO Sauce Recipe\nPasta Mains\nSummer Mains\nTomato\nTomato Sauces\nQuick Dinners"
