Let sit for 10 minutes. Pour any accumulated tomato juices into the dressing mixture.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nArrange heirloom tomato slices on a serving platter. Gently toss watermelon cubes with cocktail and cherry tomatoes and dressing; using a slotted spoon, spoon tomato and watermelon salad over heirloom tomato slices. Sprinkle with feta, mint, and flaky salt. Serve immediately with the remaining marinade/dressing on the side for drizzling.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nSpecial Equipment\nWire rack and rimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nCocktail tomatoes are small tomatoes on the vine, roughly the size of a golf ball. Any small heirloom tomato will work well here. If you can't find them, you can simply use additional cherry tomatoes.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis salad is best eaten fresh, but it can sit at room temperature for up to 4 hours, or be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Note that as it sits, excess liquid will puddle on the bottom.\nSummer Salads\nThe Latest\nTomato\nFeta Cheese\nWatermelon"
