When it starts to shimmer, add the chiles and black cardamom pods and stir constantly till fragrant, about 1 minute.\nAdd the rice and onions and stir so the oil coats each grain. Scrape the bottom of the pan frequently to prevent sticking, as the rice will give off plenty of starch. When the edges of the grains have turned translucent and the centers are milky white, add 4 cups water, bring to a boil, and cover, turning the heat down to medium.\nAfter 25 minutes, lift the lid and check on the rice. Depending on the juiciness of your onions and the thirstiness of your rice, you may need to add some water or let some excess evaporate. Add salt to taste, loosen the stuck rice from the bottom of the pan, and add the lime juice. Let the rice cool slightly before serving.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Black Cardamom\nRice & Grain Sides\nIndian\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop\nWhite Rice",
