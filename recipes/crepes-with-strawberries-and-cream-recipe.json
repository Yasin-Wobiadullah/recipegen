Using a hand blender or a whisk, whisk cream and sugar together until cream reaches stiff peaks. Cover and keep cool in the fridge.\nPlace strawberries, sugar, and orange liqueur in a bowl, toss so the strawberries are coated, then allow to sit on the counter while you assemble the crepes.\nFor the Crepes:\nWhisk together eggs, milk, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons melted butter. In a separate bowl whisk together flour, a pinch of salt, and sugar. Whisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients until no lumps remain.\nUsing a heat-proof pastry brush, brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with butter, then heat over heat until the butter begins to sputter. Add just under 1/4 cup of batter to the pan, then swirl the pan until the batter coats as much of the bottom of the pan as possible. Cook until batter begins to brown, about 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, flip the crepe and cook until the other side is brown, about 1 minute. Remove from pan and repeat with remaining batter.\nPlace 2 to 3 crepes on each plate and divide strawberries and a dollop of cream. Fold crepe in half and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch nonstick skillet\nCrepes\nStovetop\nStrawberry\nBreakfast & Brunch"
