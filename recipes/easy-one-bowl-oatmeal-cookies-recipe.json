Stir until no lumps remain, then fold in rolled oats, followed by the flour and dried cranberries or cherries. Divide into 30 one-ounce portions with a roughly 2-tablespoon scoop and arrange on prepared baking sheets. Let stand at room temperature for at least 25 minutes, no more than 75 minutes.\nBake until pale gold around the edges, but still puffed and steamy in the center, about 15 minutes. Cool directly on baking sheets until firm, about 10 minutes. Enjoy warm, or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\n#30 or #40 cookie scoop, 2\nrimmed baking sheets\nNotes\nIf the temperature drops below 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) in your kitchen, the cookie dough may solidify as it rests. If possible, set the trays of cookie dough on the stovetop, where heat from the oven will knock off the chill.\nDue to the melted butter that brings the baking soda in contact with brown sugar, this dough will not keep overnight in the fridge.\nIn this recipe, unbleached flour will prevent the dough from spreading as it should.\nCookies\nChristmas Cookies"
