Taste potatoes and adjust seasoning as needed with salt and pepper. Divide potatoes evenly among four 8-ounce wide mouth Mason jars, gently pressing and smoothing out potatoes into an even layer.\nCrack an egg into each jar, then seal jars until just finger-tight (if lids are screwed on too tightly, the jars may crack during cooking). Gently lower jars into water bath until fully submerged, and cook until egg whites are very soft and jammy,\u00a0 about 1 hour. The internal temperature of egg white should be 145\u00baF (63\u00baC).\nTransfer jars to counter. Let rest, covered, for 10 minutes to allow the egg whites to slightly set, but not firm. Unscrew lids, taking care not to let any residual water leak into the jars when opening. Season eggs with sea salt (if using) and pepper, and sprinkle with chives. Serve immediately with toasted bread for dipping.\nSpecial equipment\nImmersion circulator\n, 8-ounce widemouthed Mason jars\nNotes\nBoth our\nultra-fluffy\nand\nrich and creamy\nmashed potatoes will work for this recipe.\nIf you also have leftover gravy on-hand from a holiday meal, you can up the savory richness of this dish by spooning one tablespoon of gravy into each jar before adding the mashed potatoes in step 2.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe potato-egg jars are best enjoyed immediately, but they can be cooked in advance and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reheat jars in a sous vide water bath set to 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) until heated through, 30 minutes.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSous Vide Egg and Mashed Potato Jars Make Brunch a Hands-Off Affair\nBreakfast & Brunch\nSous Vide Eggs\nEggs\nMashed Potatoes",
