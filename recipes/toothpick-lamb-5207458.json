Add lamb and toss to coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 and up to 8 hours.\nJenny Dorsey\nFor the Spice Mixture:\nIn a spice grinder, combine chiles, Sichuan peppercorns, sesame seeds, cumin, salt, and sugar. Grind to a fine powder, then transfer to a small bowl; you should have about 1/3 cup. Set aside.\nJenny Dorsey\nTo Fry and Finish:\nSkewer each lamb piece onto a wooden toothpick, making sure each piece is fully threaded onto the toothpick, discarding aromatic ingredients as you go (it's fine if a few bits of scallion remain).\nJenny Dorsey\nMeanwhile, in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat about the 2 quarts oil to 330\u00b0F (165\u00b0C); it should fill the Dutch oven by about 2 inches. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Working in 3 to 4 batches to avoid crowding the pot, deep fry lamb, adjusting heat to maintain a frying temperature of 330\u00b0F, until well-browned on the outside, approximately 3 minutes per batch. Using a spider strainer, transfer lamb to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining lamb.\nJenny Dorsey\nHeat a wok or large cast iron skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons oil, carefully swirling to coat inner surface, then remove from heat and carefully wipe out oil with a paper towel. Return wok or skillet to high heat, add remaining 1/4 cup oil, and heat until shimmering. Add chiles and garlic and stir-fry, tossing and stirring constantly, until very fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nJenny Dorsey\nAdd lamb and cilantro and stir-fry until lamb is fully heated through and well combined with the aromatics, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon of the spice mix, and toss to combine. Repeat, one tablespoon at a time, until well seasoned. The dish should have a slow burn, numbing and sweet, but its intensity can be adjusted to taste. Serve immediately.\nJenny Dorsey\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven or heavy pot, frying thermometer, wok, spice grinder, spider strainer, wooden toothpicks.\nNotes\nEr jing tiao chiles are one of the most commonly used types in Sichuan cooking, prized for their balanced heat and fruity flavor. You can buy them at specialty retailers like Fly By Jing and Mala Market, or at Chinese supermarkets, such as 99 Ranch.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe lamb can be marinated up to 8 hours before frying, but otherwise the dish is best made right away.\nThe spice mixture can be stored in an airtight container for later use. It is best used within a month.\nChinese\nLeg of Lamb\nFrying\nStir-Fry"
