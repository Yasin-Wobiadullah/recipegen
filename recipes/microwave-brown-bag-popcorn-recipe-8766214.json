  "full_text": "Skip the Store-Bought Stuff and Make Your Own Gourmet Popcorn at Home\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n0 mins\nCook\n2 mins\nTotal\n2 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nMakes\n1 Bag of Popcorn\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\npopcorn kernels\n1/2\nteaspoon\ncanola or\nvegetable oil\nKosher salt,\nto taste\nDirections\nIn a small mixing bowl, add combine popcorn kernels, oil, and salt. Toss well until kernels are evenly coated in oil.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nTransfer popcorn kernels to a clean brown paper lunch bag. Evenly fold top of bag over by approximately 1.5 inches and then fold each of the top corners of the bag over diagonally. Tear a small tab out of the center of each diagonal fold, and then fold that over as well. This prevents the bag from opening as the popcorn expands.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nPlace the kernel-filled brown paper bag in the microwave and run on high for about 2 minutes, watching carefully the entire time to ensure the bag doesn't smolder or, worse, catch fire. The exact timing will vary depending on the microwave, so be sure to err a little on the un-popped side of things to avoid scorching and burning the popcorn. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nSpecial Equipment\nBrown paper lunch bag, microwave\nNotes\nAs noted at the start of this recipe, brown paper bags are not necessarily designed to be microwave-safe. Watch the whole time when microwaving your popcorn, and if in doubt, it's better to err on the side of leaving some kernels unpopped rather than trying to pop every last one.\nRead More\nMiso-Soup-Flavored Popcorn\nZa'atar (Thyme-, Sesame-, and Sumac-Spiced) Popcorn\nThai Red Coconut Curry Popcorn\nChicken Dinner-Flavored Popcorn\nMatcha and White Chocolate Popcorn\nBrown-Butter Maple Popcorn With Pecans\nBagna Cauda (Anchovy-Garlic) Popcorn\nSnacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian\nPopcorn"
