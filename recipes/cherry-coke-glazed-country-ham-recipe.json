Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally until thick and syrupy, about 15 minutes.\nWhen ham has reached 125\u00b0F, remove from oven, uncover, and score fat cap in crosshatch pattern, making slices about 1-inch apart. Paint with 1/3 of glaze, increase oven temperature to 400 degrees, and bake 5 minutes. Paint with 1/3 more glaze and bake until crisp and shiny, 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven and paint with remaining glaze. Tent with foil and allow to rest 30 minutes before slicing and serving.\nPork Mains\nRoasted Pork\nHam\nThanksgiving Dinner\nEaster"
