Lay shrimp on paper towel-lined baking sheet and blot to fully dry.\nHeat peanut oil over high heat in a large, heavy dutch oven or wok to 390 degrees as read on an\ninstant read\nor deep-frying thermometer, about 12 minutes. Lower heat to maintain temperature.\nWhisk flour and rice flour together in a large bowl. Add eggs and soda water and, shaking bowl with one hand, rapidly whisk with other hand with a pair of chopsticks until the mixture just comes together. There should still be dry clumps of flour remaining. Line a second bowl with a triple layer of paper towels.\nWorking in two batches, submerge shrimp in batter and turn to coat. Pick up a handful of shrimp, allow excess batter to drip off, and carefully drop into hot oil one at a time. Repeat until first half of shrimp are all in the fryer. Fry, agitating constantly with chopsticks or wire mesh spider until tempura is a pale golden brown and very crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer the fried shrimp to the paper-towel lined bowl, season with salt, and toss to drain excess oil. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 200\u00b0F oven to keep warm. Allow oil to reheat to 390\u00b0F and repeat with remaining shrimp.\nTransfer drained shrimp to bowl with sauce and toss to coat. Serve immediately, sprinkled with extra chives.\nJapanese",
