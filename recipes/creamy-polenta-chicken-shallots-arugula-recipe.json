Heat 4 cups broth in medium saucepan over medium heat to simmer. Add chicken and reduce heat to bare simmer. Cook until chicken is just cooked through (160\u00b0F), about 15 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate (reserve all broth) and shred into bite sized pieces when cool enough to handle. Place chicken in a small bowl and pour 3/4 cup broth over chicken to keep moist. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nHeat 3 tablespoons oil in medium skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add shallots, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and cook, stirring, until shallot begin to turn golden, 10 to 15 minutes.\nHeat 5 cups broth (using both chicken cooking broth and fresh unused broth) in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. When broth comes to boil, whisk in polenta in a fine steady stream. Bring to simmer, whisking, then lower heat so that mixture remains at a low boil (see note). Cook until polenta is soft and creamy, stirring occasionally (see note), and adding extra broth as necessary (use water if broth runs out).\nWhen polenta is cooked, remove from heat and whisk in butter and Parmesan until combined. Season to taste and keep warm (see note).\nAdd chicken (with broth) to shallots and heat over medium heat until just warmed through. Season to taste.\nSpoon polenta into serving bowls and top with chicken mixture and pine nuts. Top with arugula and drizzle with remaining oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.\nQuick Dinners\nChicken\nCornmeal"
