Sift flour into a medium bowl, then whisk in baking powder, sugar, and salt. Add butter and toss to break up the pieces, then smash each one flat between your fingertips. Continue smashing and rubbing until butter disappears into a coarse meal. Add milk chocolate and toss to combine, then stir in milk and cream to form a soft dough.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTurn onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a 7-inch round. Cut into 6 wedges with a chef\u2019s knife, sprinkle generously with toasted or turbinado sugar, and arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Bake until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes. If you like, serve with clotted cream and strawberry jam, or a spoonful of\nsuper-thick and fruity whipped cream\n.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nHalf sheet pan\nNotes\nI love topping these scones with\nlightly toasted sugar\nleft over from\nblind-baking a pie\n, but if you don't have any on hand, turbinado sugar can be used to similar effect.\nRead More\nFreeze Scone Dough to Bake Up a Breakfast Treat Any Time\nBlueberry-Lemon Scones (Vegan)\nEasy Ham and Cheese Scones\nScones\nQuick Breads\nChocolate\nQuick Breakfast",
