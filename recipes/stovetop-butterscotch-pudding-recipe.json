In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, whisk together toasted sugar, malted milk powder, cornstarch, and salt. Add egg yolks and just a splash of the milk. Whisk until no lumps remain, then whisk in the remaining milk.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCook over medium-low heat, stirring with the whisk until quite warm, about 4 minutes. Increase to medium heat, and gently whisk until the custard thickens, about 3 minutes, then continue cooking and whisking a minute longer. Immediately strain into the prepared bowl, pressing with a flexible spatula until the custard passes through. Add vanilla extract and stir until no longer billowing with steam. Serve warm, or refrigerate up to 1 week in an airtight container; stir before serving cold.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nMedium bowl\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n, 3-quart stainless steel\nsaucier\nNotes\nThis recipe works great with\nquick-toasted sugar\n, but if you have some\nlightly toasted sugar\nleftover from\nblind baking a pie\n, you can use that too. For a simple variation, this recipe can also be made with a semi-refined cane sugar or a 50/50 blend of white and light brown sugar, for a flavor that's a little more molassesy but lovely in its own way.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPudding can be refrigerated for up to 1 week in an airtight container.\nRead More\nCreamy Banana-Flavored Pudding Recipe\nHomemade Jell-O Style Chocolate Pudding Recipe\nSticky Toffee Pudding Recipe\nBoozy Butterscotch Ice Cream Recipe\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nStovetop\nMother's Day\nFather's Day\nWinter Desserts",
