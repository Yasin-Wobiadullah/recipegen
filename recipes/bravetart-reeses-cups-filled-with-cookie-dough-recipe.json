Drizzle in the vanilla and then add the chocolate chips.\nUse a rubber spatula to transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large, plain tip.\nPrepare the cups: Arrange 12 cupcake liners on a baking sheet, set aside. Temper the chocolate, or proceed with melted chocolate instead. In either case, pour 1/2 ounce chocolate into each cupcake liner.\nUse the pastry bag to pipe about three quarters of an ounce of cookie dough directly into the center of each cup. This will force the chocolate away from the center and up the sides. (You can see step by step photos of this process\nhere\n.)\nUse a damp finger to gently pat down the \"peak\" of each cookie dough center. Next, top each cup with another half ounce of chocolate.\nTake the sheet pan in both hands a gently rap it against the counter to level the chocolate and dislodge any air bubbles.\nIf using untempered chocolate, refrigerate cups until hardened, about thirty minutes. Tempered chocolate will harden on its own in a few minutes\nStore cups in an airtight container. They will keep for about a week at room temperature or indefinitely in the fridge or freezer. Unwrap just before serving.\nPlease remember, if you use untempered chocolate you must store the candies in the refrigerator at all times.\nSpecial equipment\npiping bag, plain tip\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBraveTart: Cookie Dough-Filled Reese's Cups\nCookies\nAmerican\nChocolate\nCandy",
