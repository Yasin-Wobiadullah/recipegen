In a medium saucepan, cover potatoes with cold salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes after coming to a boil. Drain potatoes in a colander and let drain for 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nWhile potatoes drain, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil in a medium non-stick or cast iron skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add potatoes, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until well-browned on most sides, about 5 minutes. Add remaining vegetable or canola oil, brussels sprouts, and kale leaves and cook, folding occasionally, until kale and sprouts are starting to wilt, about 2 minutes. Add onions and continue to cook, stirring and folding occasionally, until all vegetables are softened and starting to crisp, about 8 minutes. Stir in hot sauce and half of parsley, season to taste with salt and pepper, and remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nMake two wells in the vegetables and drizzle each with a few drops of olive oil. Add 1 egg to each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with remaining olive oil. Transfer to oven and cook until eggs are barely set, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: How to Make the Best Potato Hash\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nSavory\nBrussels Sprouts\nKale\nYukon Gold Potatoes",
