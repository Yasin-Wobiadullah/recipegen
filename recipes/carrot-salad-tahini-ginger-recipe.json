Season with salt.\nDrain carrots, add to bowl with dressing and toss to coat. Serve.\nNotes\nSmall, slender young carrots are particularly beautiful in this dish and can be cooked whole, but any size carrot will work as long as you cut it into spears of about 1/2-inch in diameter before cooking. If you use young carrots with very thin skins, scrubbing them is enough; if they're larger and older, you can peel the skins before cooking.\nRead More\nRoasted-Carrot Salad With Peanut-Sesame Mole Recipe\nGajarachi Koshimbir (Carrot Salad with Mustard Seeds and Curry Leaves) Recipe\nRye Berry and Carrot Salad Recipe\nDairy-free Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nSesame & Tahini"
