Coat duck breasts entirely with cure and place in a large resealable plastic bag. Place in the coldest part of the refrigerator and cure for 72 hours, flipping bag twice a day.\nRemove duck breasts from bag and wash as much cure off as possible under cold running water. Place breasts in a large container, fill with water, and let soak for 2 hours, replacing water every 30 minutes. Remove from water and pat dry with paper towels.\nFor the Rub:\nMix together black pepper, coriander, juniper berries, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Coat duck breasts entirely with rub.\nFire up\nsmoker\nor\ngrill\nto 225\u00b0F (110\u00b0C), adding smoking wood chunks when at temperature. When wood is ignited and producing smoke, place duck breasts in, skin side down, and smoke until an instant-read thermometer registers 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) when inserted into center of breasts, 1 1/2 - 2 hours.\nRemove from smoker and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve immediately, or store in refrigerator for up to a week, slicing and serving as needed. For best results, steam slices to reheat.\nSpecial Equipment\nSmoker\nNotes\nPink salt, used for curing (not to be confused with popular specialty salts, like Himalayan pink salt), is a mixture of sodium chloride (table salt) and sodium nitrite. It is dyed pink so it\u2019s not confused for regular salt and used in excess. When used for curing, it helps preserve color, promote flavor, and prevent undesirable bacteria growth.\u00a0You can find pink salt (also called Prague powder) online or in larger grocery stores.\nDuck Mains\nGrilling\nDuck",
