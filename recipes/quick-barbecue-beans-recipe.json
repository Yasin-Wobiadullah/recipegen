Place a 12-inch skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add bacon and cook until fat has rendered and bacon has crisped, 7-10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving as much fat in the pan as possible.\nAdd onion to pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion softens and begins to brown around the edges, about 7 minutes. Stir in green pepper, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, apple juice, honey, molasses, vinegar, barbecue rub, mustard, hot sauce, and reserved bacon; bring to a simmer. Gently fold in pork and beans, butter beans, and great northern beans.\nTransfer beans to oven and cook, uncovered, until beans are heated through and sauce has thickened, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes. Season with salt. Serve immediately; alternatively, store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or freeze. Reheat before serving.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Best Barbecue Beans, Whether You Have 1 Hour or 16\nBeans Sides\nSavory\nBeans",
