Beat eggs lightly with 1/3 cup milk and add to dry ingredients. Using a fork, quickly and gently combine wet and dry ingredients. If dough is very thick and difficult to work together, add more milk, up to 1/2 cup in total. Allow dough to rest for about 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, prepare a large pot of salted boiling water. Moisten a wooden cutting board with cool water. Spread a portion of the batter into a long strip along the board.\nUse a large offset spatula to cut off small, thin strips of the batter and drop them into salted, boiling water. Cut the dough at small angles to keep the sp\u00e4tzle from getting too long. As you cut the dough, let the small bits drop into the boiling water. Once the sp\u00e4tzle float, let them cook at a gentle boil for another 1 to 2 minutes, until they no longer have a raw flour taste and have a pleasantly firm texture.\nRemove cooked sp\u00e4tzle with a strainer and shock briefly in ice water. Drain cooled sp\u00e4tzle well and spread on a baking sheet to dry further while you continue cutting and cooking remaining dough. (To store the sp\u00e4tzle for future use, see the make-ahead and storage section below.)\nKumiko Mitarai\nHeat a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter and add bread crumbs and parsley. Toss to coat evenly and cook until lightly toasted and crisp. Transfer bread crumbs out of pan and set aside.\nAdd a small amount of cooking oil (a little more if speck is very lean) to the skillet. Cook speck or bacon until fat is rendered and meat is crispy. Add peas and remaining 2 to 3 tablespoons of butter. When butter is melted, add sp\u00e4tzle. Cook until sp\u00e4tzle is heated through and slightly browned in some spots. Season with additional salt, to taste.\nTransfer to a serving platter and top with buttered bread crumbs. Serve hot.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe sp\u00e4tzle can be made ahead of time. To use the next day, simply transfer the sp\u00e4tzle to a container after they have dried off for 30 minutes, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use. To hold them for up to three weeks, let the sp\u00e4tzle dry for 30 minutes and then place the baking sheet in the freezer for about one hour. Transfer the frozen sp\u00e4tzle to a zip-top bag or another well-sealed container and keep in the freezer (thaw before using).\nPastas\nEastern European\nAustrian\nGerman\nHam",
