Remove pecans from oven and let cool to room temperature and then roughly chop.\nFor the Cranberry Sauce:\nCombine cranberries, brown sugar, white sugar, water, orange juice, orange zest, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until berries start to pop, about 5 minutes. Press berries against side of pan with wooden spoon and continue to cook until berries have broken down and sauce thickens to a jam-like consistency, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and let cool for 30 minutes. Adjust consistency with water as needed. Stir in pecans. Serve immediately or place in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator.
