Mix on low to form a crumbly meal, then fold in pumpkin seeds by hand. Transfer to a small bowl, cover with plastic, and freeze until needed, up to 1 month.\nFor the Muffins:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Combine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cloves, nutmeg, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (no need to wash after making streusel). Mix on low to form a mealy powder, about 2 minutes. Add pumpkin pur\u00e9e, Greek yogurt, eggs, and vanilla, mixing only until dry ingredients disappear. With a flexible spatula, fold batter once or twice to make sure it's well mixed from the bottom up.\nLightly grease a standard muffin pan. (You can line with muffin papers if desired, but you'll still need to grease the flat part of the pan.) Divide batter evenly between cups, filling each to the brim. Sprinkle generously with streusel, then bake until puffed and firm, about 25 minutes. Cool at least 5 minutes before serving. Store leftovers in an airtight container for about 2 days.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\nwith paddle attachment, standard\nmuffin pan\n,\nmuffin liners\n(optional)\nNotes\nAvoid Greek yogurt thickened with gum, gelatin, or pectin. Look for brands that contain only milk and active cultures; this recipe was tested with both Fage and Chobani.\nRead More\nMuffin Recipes to Start Your Day\nPumpkin Spice Cake Recipe\nPumpkin Spice Ice Cream Recipe\nBreakfast & Brunch\nMuffins\nPumpkin\nFall Breakfast & Brunch\nWinter Breakfast & Brunch"
