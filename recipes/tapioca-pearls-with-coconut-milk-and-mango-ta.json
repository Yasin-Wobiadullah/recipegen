Combine the rice flour with the 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water in a large bowl and mix until a dough comes together. The dough should be slightly tacky and you should be able to form the dough into a large sphere. If the dough is too dry and crumbly, slowly add more water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough can hold its shape.\nForm the rice flour balls by pinching off about a teaspoon of the dough and rolling it between your palms to form a small sphere about 1/2 in (1.25 cm) in diameter. You should be able to make about 20 small rice balls from the dough. Cover the rice balls with a damp paper towel and set aside.\nDrain the tapioca in a fine-mesh sieve set over the sink and rinse with cold running water. Allow the tapioca to continue draining over the sink.\nTo make the porridge, combine the coconut milk with the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water in a large saucepan. Stir in the salt and the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and then add the rice balls to the saucepan and gently simmer, stirring to ensure the rice balls don\u2019t stick to each other. Continue simmering the rice balls until they are cooked through and become pleasantly chewy, 3\u20135 minutes. As the rice balls simmer, they will become firmer and expand slightly.\nIncrease the heat to high and return the liquid to a boil. As soon as the liquid boils, turn off the heat and stir in the drained tapioca pearls. Continue to stir until the tapioca becomes tender and translucent, 2\u20133 minutes. If the porridge becomes too thick for your liking, you can thin it out with more water or coconut milk.\nStir in the mangoes and serve the porridge warm.\nSoutheast Asian Cuisines\nMango\nCoconut Milk & Cream\nFilipino Cuisine"
