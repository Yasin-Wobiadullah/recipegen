Add bulgur wheat and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly. (Bulgur will absorb much of the water; draining simply gets rid of excess moisture, if any.)\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nWhile wheat cooks, combine parsley, mint, cilantro, garlic, jalape\u00f1o and coriander in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides as necessary, about 10 to 16 short pulses. Add half of chickpeas and pulse until a rough puree is formed, scraping down sides as necessary, about 8 to 16 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nAdd remaining chickpeas to food processor and pulse until roughly chopped, 4 to 6 pulses. Transfer to bowl with chickpea/herb mixture. When bulgur wheat has drained, add to bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then fold mixture together, starting with a rubber spatula, and finishing by hand when cool enough to handle. Form mixture into patties roughly 1/2-inch thick and 2.5 inches wide (you should be able to work 8 to 12 patties).\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nCombine flour and water in a medium bowl and whisk until smooth. Place breadcrumbs in second medium bowl.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nWorking one patty at a time, dip in flour mixture to coat, then transfer to breadcrumbs. Cover with breadcrumbs on all sides, then transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining patties.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nHeat half of oil in a large cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half the patties in a single layer and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until golden brown on bottoms, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip and cook second side, swirling pan occasionally as they cook, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and keep warm; wipe skillet clean and repeat with remaining oil and remaining patties.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nPlace avocado in a medium bowl and mash the flesh with a fork. Season with salt and add lime juice. Serve fried chickpea patties with mashed avocado, sliced onions, herbs, lime or lemon wedges, and pickles.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nChickpeas\nVegan Mains\nFrying\nAvocado",
