Line an 8- by 4-inch loaf pan (see note) with parchment paper, allowing edges to overhang. Grease unlined part of pan.\nWhisk sugar, oil, pumpkin, eggs, pumpkin, and salt in a large bowl until combined. Add flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove to the batter, and then whisk until completely combined.\nSpoon 2 cups batter into pan. Spoon 1 cup batter into measuring cup and reserve.\nWhisk cocoa and milk into remaining batter and spoon into pan. Using a butter knife or small offset spatula, swirl the batter a few times, lifting pumpkin batter from the bottom. Then spoon reserved pumpkin batter over the top and swirl a few times more (see note).\nBake until top is just set and skewer inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs, 60 to 75 minutes. Let cool in pan 45 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.\nSpecial Equipment\n8- by 4-inch or 9- by 5-inch loaf pan\nNotes\nI like to use Williams Sonoma's Goldtouch 8- by 4-inch loaf pan. This recipe can be made in a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, just decrease the baking time to 50 minutes. Avoid over-swirling the batter or it will become all chocolate.\nPumpkin\nQuick Breads\nChocolate\nBreakfast & Brunch\nFall Breakfast & Brunch"
