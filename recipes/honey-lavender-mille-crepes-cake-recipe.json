Add flour and pulse to combine. Add milk, water, egg yolks, melted butter, and salt and pulse until mixture is smooth. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 48 hours.\nAfter cr\u00eape batter has rested, line baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir ingredients together to recombine. Heat cr\u00eape pan over medium-high heat and brush with butter. Pour about 3 tablespoons batter into pan, swirling to coat entire surface. Cook until bottom of cr\u00eape begins to spot and the top is dry, 45 to 60 seconds. Gently loosen edges of cr\u00eape from pan with a heat-proof rubber spatula or offset (metal) spatula and flip. Cook an additional 30 seconds, until bottom is spotted.\nSlide cr\u00eape onto prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining batter (there should be 18 to 20 cr\u00eapes).\nFor the Honey Pastry Cream:\nBring milk, honey, vanilla bean seeds, and vanilla bean pod to boil in small saucepan over medium heat, then remove from heat and allow to steep for 10 minutes. Remove and discard pod, or, rinse, pat dry, and reserve for other use.\nIn large heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk together egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Gradually whisk in milk and bring mixture to boil over medium-high heat, constantly and vigorously whisking. Once mixture has reached the boil, continue to cook for 1 to 2 minutes to avoid a weepy pastry cream.\nStrain pastry cream into large bowl. Stir in butter. Set bowl in an ice bath and stir until pastry cream cools, about 10 minutes. Press piece of plastic wrap and directly onto surface of pastry cream and refrigerate until needed.\nFor the Assembly:\nWhisk cream in large bowl until soft peaks form. Whisk chilled pastry cream to loosen, then, fold in whipped cream.\nArrange one cr\u00eape on cake stand or serving plate. With offset spatula or back of soup spoon, spread about 1/4 cup pastry cream on cr\u00eape. Top with second cr\u00eape and repeat procedure with remaining cr\u00eapes and pastry cream. Chill milles cr\u00eapes at least 2 hours and up to 48 hours prior to serving.
