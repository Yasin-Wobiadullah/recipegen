Stir to coat and let cook until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Stir often to keep spice mix from burning. Add tomatoes, scrape browned bits off bottom of pan, and cover. Keep at a simmer for 20 minutes.\nHeat large wok or cast iron skillet until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon ghee, then fry paneer until browned on several sides. To reduce sticking, let paneer fry for at least 30 seconds before trying to stir. Set aside on paper towel-lined plate.\nLet pan come back to high temperature. If it's looking dry, add last tablespoon of ghee, then peppers. Stir frequently and cook just until they blister and begin to tenderize. Return paneer to pan and pour gravy on top. Add fengureek leaves, stir to combine and cook for one minute. Squeeze on lime juice and add any additional salt to taste. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nAnother firm frying cheese, such as halloumi or kasseri, can be substituted for the paneer.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Fenugreek (Methi)\nIndian\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Vegetables\nPaneer\nBell Peppers"
