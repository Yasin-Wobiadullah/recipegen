Add ghee to bowl and, using your hand, rub it into dry ingredients until well incorporated. Slowly drizzle in water, while mixing with your hand, until a firm yet supple dough forms; add the water slowly and make sure to mix it well as you go, as you may need slightly more or less water to reach the desired dough consistency. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest at room temperature for 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMake the Paste:\nIn a small mixing bowl, stir together liquid ghee and rice flour to form a paste.\nForm the Chiroti:\nOnce dough has rested, divide it into 2 equal portions. Transfer one portion to a work surface and keep the other covered with plastic to prevent drying.\nUsing your hands, roll the dough into a uniform log shape, then divide it into 5 equal portions, each weighing about 1.7 ounces (50g).\nUsing your hands, form each piece of dough into a ball. Using a rolling pin, and working with one piece at a time, roll each dough portion into a thin circle, flipping and rotating the dough 90 degrees between rolls, until it is about 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18cm) in diameter. Keep the rolled dough portions covered with a kitchen towel to prevent drying.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nOnce all 5 small dough balls have been rolled into thin circles, set one circle on a work surface. Using a pastry brush, brush dough circle all over with the paste. Set another dough circle directly on top of the first one and brush it with the paste. Continue until you have a stack of all 5 dough circles, each brushed with the paste.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRoll the stack of dough rounds tightly, like a jelly roll. Using a sharp knife, cut the roll into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Using a rolling pin, roll each of the pieces out into oval whorls about 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10cm) long.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRepeat steps 4 through 7 with the second portion of dough.\nFry the Chiroti:\nIn a heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 inches oil to 365\u00b0F (185\u00b0C) over medium to low heat. Carefully add a few whorls of dough to the oil, making sure not to crowd the pot; each whorl should have enough space to float without overlapping any others. Fry, turning once or twice, until golden and crisp on both sides, about 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing a spider, slotted spoon, or strainer, transfer chiroti to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining whorls. Serve hot or at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nRolling pin, pastry brush, heavy-bottomed pot,\ninstant-read thermometer\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStored in an airtight container, the chiroti will keep at cool room temperature for about 4 days.\nRead More\nShining a Light on Diwali Treats: An Opinionated Guide\nPastries\nIndian\nFrying\nDiwali"
