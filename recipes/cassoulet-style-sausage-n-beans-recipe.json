Preheat a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the sausages. Brown the sausages thoroughly on both sides.\nWhile the sausages are browning, make the breadcrumbs. Drop the whole clove of garlic into the food processor, and blitz. Add the cubed baguette, 1 tablespoon of parsley, and 1 teaspoon of thyme. Blitz until the cubes are crumbs. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and salt and pepper, and blitz to combine. Set aside.\nWhen the sausages are almost ready, add the bacon to the pan with the sausages, and saut\u00e9 until the bacon is golden brown. Take the sausages out of the pan, and set to one side.\nLower the heat to low, and carefully add the onion. Season with salt and pepper, and saut\u00e9 for 2 minutes. Add the garlic, and saut\u00e9 another 2 minutes. Add the drained tomatoes. Raise the heat to high, and cook until the pan is dry and the tomatoes are just beginning to catch. Add the wine, and again, cook until the pan is nearly dry. Add the vegetable broth, 1 tablespoon of roughly chopped parsley and 1 teaspoon of thyme, along with the beans. Cook for 1 minute, until the broth is bubbling.\nTransfer the bean mixture to a wide, shallow baking dish. Arrange the sausages on top. Then top with the breadcrumb mixture. Drizzle lightly with olive oil, and bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes, until the sides of the pan are bubbling and golden and the breadcrumbs are gorgeous and toasted. Serve hot with a green salad tossed with olive oil, white wine vinegar, and salt and pepper, and some crusty baguette on the side.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFrench in a Flash: Cassoulet-Style Sausage 'n' Beans\nPork Mains\nFrench\nSavory\nCannellini & Kidney Beans\nSausages"
