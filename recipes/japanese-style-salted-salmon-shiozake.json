Pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle salt evenly all over both fillets. Press salt into the flesh and skin to ensure it adheres well.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPlace salted salmon fillets in a glass container, such as a small glass baking dish, lined with paper towels. Cover container and refrigerate overnight, or up to 36 hours. Every 12 hours, replace paper towels and flip fillets over.\nWhen ready to cook, place oven rack in top position and preheat broiler. Place salmon fillets on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil salmon until it has exuded some fat and started to brown, about 3 minutes. (The timing will vary depending on broiler strength and distance from the broiler element.)\nTurn salmon fillets over and cook until salmon is nicely colored and fat is spitting, about 3 minutes longer (see note). Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nUsing sake lends some flavor benefits, but is entirely optional.\nThe amount of salt recommended in this recipe is about 3% of the weight of the salmon fillets. You can use more or less salt to your taste, but keep in mind that the salmon is\nmeant to be\nvery salty.\nCured Japanese salmon is meant to be cooked thoroughly (well done); it is more important to get color on the fillets than to worry about overcooking them.\nRead More\nHow to Make a Traditional Japanese Breakfast\n5-Minute Miso Glazed Salmon\nCrispy Pan-Seared Salmon Fillets\nSalmon\nJapanese\nBreakfast & Brunch",
