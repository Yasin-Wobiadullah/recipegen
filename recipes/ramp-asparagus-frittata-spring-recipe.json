Set aside.\nIn a pot of boiling salted water, blanch asparagus until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer asparagus to an ice bath or cold water to chill. Drain and cut asparagus into 1-inch lengths.\nAdjust rack to 4 inches below broiler and preheat broiler to high. Heat oil in a 10-inch oven-safe nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron or carbon steel skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add sliced ramp bulbs and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in ramp leaves and thyme and cook until leaves are just wilted, about 1 minute. Stir in asparagus and cook until warmed through, 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.\nPour eggs into skillet and cook, stirring and scraping pan all over, until loose curds form throughout, about 3 minutes; stop stirring before they permanently separate into scrambled eggs. Let cook until eggs on bottom are set, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPlace frittata under broiler and cook just until eggs on top are set. Shake pan to loosen frittata, using a spatula to separate the edges if necessary. Turn frittata out onto a plate or serve directly from skillet. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nIf you don't have ramps, you can substitute a similar amount of diced leek plus 2 thinly sliced cloves of garlic. Saut\u00e9 both in oil, like the ramps, until softened.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch oven-safe nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast iron or carbon steel skillet\nRead More\n14 Ramp Recipes to Celebrate Ramp Season\nFrittatas\nGluten-free Breakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nSavory\nAsparagus"
