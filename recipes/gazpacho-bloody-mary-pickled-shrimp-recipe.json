Drain and set aside.\nMeanwhile, combine onion, garlic, cider vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and bay leaf in a nonreactive bowl, Mason jar, or other container. Add shrimp and stir well. Place in fridge for at least 45 minutes and up to 2 days.\nTo Make the Cocktail:\nCombine tomatoes, cucumber, onion, bell pepper, and garlic in a large bowl and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil and vinegar on top. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature.\nToss all ingredients with a wooden spoon or with your hands until evenly incorporated. Transfer half of the contents, including liquid at bottom of bowl, to the jar of a blender. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, about 3 minutes. Press mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl. Repeat with remaining mixture (you may need to work in more batches). Season with more salt, pepper, and vinegar as desired. Pass through strainer one more time.\nPour mixture into a large pitcher. Add gin, horseradish, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Adjust to taste.\nSet out 6 tall beer or Collins glasses. Fill with ice and pour drink on top. Garnish each rim with 3 pickled shrimp.\nSpecial equipment\nBlender\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFour New Twists on the Bloody Mary\nGin\nPickling\nShrimp\nSummer Drinks",
