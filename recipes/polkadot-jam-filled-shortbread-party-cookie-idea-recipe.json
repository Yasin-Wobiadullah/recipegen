Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar until fluffy, 3 minutes. Add salt and flour and beat until just combined. Divide dough in two equal pieces. Press each piece into a 7- by 7-inch square, one on each baking sheet.\nUse a knife to lightly score each square of dough into 9 squares. Use the fat end of a chopstick to press holes all over dough, though don't poke through completely. Bake until shortbread is golden, about 35 minutes. Take out of the oven and while dough is still a little soft, press down on holes again to deepen imprint. Let cool completely.\nCut dough along score lines to create individual squares. Fill a pastry bag (or a ziplock with one corner cut off) with jam. Pipe a little jam into each square. If transporting, let jam set for 30 minutes before packing.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n, chopstick, two\nrimmed baking sheets\n, pastry bag or ziplock bag\nNotes\nYou can use most any jam (or combination of jams) to fill these cookies. Avoid jellies, which are too gelatinous to pipe, chunky preserves, or anything with seeds.\nRead More\nCookie Monster: Polka Dot Shortbread\nCookies\nButter",
