Add olive oil and yogurt or milk and knead with dough hook at low speed until dough comes together into a smooth ball (dough should stick slightly to bottom of bowl as it kneads). If dough hasn't come together, add yogurt or milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough forms a smooth ball. Continue to knead for 5 minutes. Alternatively, form dough in a food processor by adding all ingredients and processing until the dough rides around the blade. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature until roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.\nTurn dough out onto floured work surface. Using a bench scraper or a knife, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then place on a well-floured surface (leaving a few inches of space between each one) and cover with a floured cloth. Alternatively, place each ball of dough in an individual covered pint-size deli container. Allow dough to rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes.\nClean and oil\nthe grilling grate.\nWorking with one ball of dough at a time, stretch dough with floured hands or a rolling pin into an oblong or circle roughly 10 inches long and 6 inches wide. Once you have 2 or 3 pieces stretched, lay them out directly above the hot side of the grill. Cook without moving, popping any large air bubbles with a knife or the edge of a spatula or pizza peel, until bottom side is charred in spots and light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a large spatula, pizza peel, or tongs and cook until other side is charred and browned, about 2 minutes. Remove bread from the grill, transfer to a large plate, and cover with a clean dish towel to keep warm while you cook the remaining bread.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTo Serve:\nFor the za'atar, whisk together oregano, thyme, savory, sesame seeds, sumac, and salt in a small bowl until combined. Brush finished flatbreads with olive oil and sprinkle generously with za'atar. Place labne in a serving dish, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with za'atar. Serve bread with labne alongside immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n,\nchimney starter\n,\nstand mixer\nor\nfood processor\nNotes\nFor a much quicker, easier version, use store-bought flatbreads reheated on the grill until crisp and blistered on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Brush with olive oil and za'atar as directed.\nStore-bought pre-mixed za'atar can be used in place of the homemade version. Use 1/2 cup total. If using commercial za'atar, salt content will vary; adjust according to taste.\nIf you cannot find sumac, add 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest to the mixture in its place.\nLabne is a Middle Eastern strained yogurt that can be found in most high-end grocery stores, such as Whole Foods, or in specialty markets. If unavailable, use strained Greek yogurt instead.\nRead More\nHow to Get Started Grilling\nAll About Labaneh\nGrilled Chicken With Za'atar Recipe\nBread\nMiddle Eastern\nGrilling\nSides"
