  "full_text": "The Food Lab's Foolproof Onion Rings Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nActive\n45 mins\nTotal\n105 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nlarge\nonions\n, cut into 1/2-inch round\n2\nquarts\npeanut oil\n1\ncup\nall-purpose flour\n1/2\ncup\ncornstarch\n1\nteaspoon\nbaking powder\n1/4\nteaspoon\nbaking soda\n1/2\nteaspoon\npaprika\n3/4\ncup\nlight-flavored beer (such as PBR or\nBudweiser\n), ice-cold\n1/4\ncup\n80-proof vodka\nKosher salt\nDirections\nSeparate onion rounds into individual rings. Place in a gallon-sized zipper-lock freezer bag and put them in the freezer until completely frozen, at least 1 hour (they can stay in the freezer for up to 1 month).\nWhen ready to fry, remove onion rings from freezer bag, transfer to a bowl, and thaw under tepid running water. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with a clean kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels and dry the rings thoroughly. Carefully peel off the inner papery membrane from each ring and discard (the rings will be very floppy). Set aside.\nPreheat oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) in a large wok or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and paprika in a medium bowl and whisk together. Combine beer and vodka in a small bowl.\nSlowly add beer mixture to flour mixture, whisking constantly until batter has texture of thick paint (you may not need all of the beer). Batter should leave a trail if you drip it back into the bowl off the whisk. Do not overmix; a few small lumps are OK. Dip one onion ring in batter, making sure that all surfaces are coated, lift it out, letting excess batter drip off, and add it to the hot oil by slowly lowering it in with your fingers until just one side is sticking out, then dropping it in. Repeat until half of the rings are in the oil. Fry, flipping rings halfway through cooking, until they are deep golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer rings to a large mixing bowl lined with paper towels and toss while sprinkling salt over them. The fried rings can be placed on a rack on a rimmed baking sheet and kept hot in a 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C) oven while you fry the remaining rings. Serve the rings immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nor\nDutch oven\nRead More\nFor the Wispiest, Crispiest Deep-Fried Crusts, Grab the Vodka\nA Beginner's Guide to Onions\nOnion Bahji (Indian Onion Fritters) Recipe\nMozzarella-Stuffed Crispy Baked Onion Rings Recipe\nOnions\nVegetable Sides\nGame Day"
