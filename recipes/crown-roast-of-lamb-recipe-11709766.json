Generously season crown roast all over with salt and pepper. Place roast on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and roast until lamb registers 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of loin, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, for the Stuffing:\nIn a heatproof bowl, pour boiling stock or water over apricots, prunes, and pistachios and let steep until softened and plump, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and coriander, lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring often, until golden and soft, about 8 minutes. Drain dried fruit and pistachios of any excess liquid. In a large bowl, toss together Israeli couscous, apricots, prunes, pistachios, cooked onions, parsley, and remaining 1/2 cup (120ml) olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the couscous mixture to keep warm.\nFor the Sauce:\nUsing an immersion blender, blender, or food processor, pulse mint, parsley, and pistachios until roughly chopped. Add 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil and pulse until herbs and nuts are finely chopped. Stir in remaining 3/4 cup (180ml) olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste. Set aside.\nWhen lamb reaches 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C), remove from oven. Increase oven to highest possible temperature (broil setting on some ovens, or about 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C on others) and allow to heat fully. Cover lamb rib bones with foil. Roast lamb, checking temperature every 5 minutes and then more frequently as it approaches doneness, until lamb is browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of lamb registers 125 to 130\u00b0F (52 to 54\u00b0C) for medium-rare, or 130 to 135\u00b0F (54 to 57\u00b0C) for medium, about 10 minutes. Let lamb rest for 15 minutes.\nStuff with warm couscous and serve, passing sauce at the table. To carve lamb, slice lamb between rib bones into chops.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n;\nwire rack\n;\ninstant-read thermometer\n;\nimmersion blender\n,\nblender\n, or\nfood processor\nNotes\nThe method used here for cooking the crown roast works no matter what the stuffing and sauce are. In fact, the stuffing and sauce in this recipe are entirely optional. Feel free to precook any stuffing you like, then stuff it into the finished roast right before serving. Or, skip the stuffing altogether.\nLamb\nRecipes\nEaster\nRoasted Lamb",
