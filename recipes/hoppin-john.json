Set over high heat, bring to a boil, then cook at a boil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle boil, cover with the lid slightly ajar, and cook until the ham hock is fork-tender, about 3 hours; top up with boiling water as needed to keep the ham hock covered. Discard bay leaves. Transfer ham hock and onion to a heatproof plate or bowl to cool. Measure 2 quarts (1.9L) broth and return it to the Dutch oven; save any remaining broth for another use.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nPull ham hock meat and skin from the bones. Roughly chop up any larger pieces, then return meat, skin, and bones along with the onion to the pot.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nDrain field peas from soaking water, rinse, and add to the pot.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nAdd salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Set over high heat and return to a boil. Lower heat to maintain a gentle boil, cover with the lid slightly ajar, and cook until peas are al dente, about 45 minutes. About 15 minutes before peas are al dente, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Add parboiled rice to pot, stir to combine, then return to a full boil over high heat and cook for 1 minute, then turn off heat.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nStir the pot well to incorporate the ingredients, cover fully with lid, and cook in oven for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nFluff with a fork, and serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nThere are many sources for field peas, but two good options available online are the ones from\nAnson Mills\nand\nCamellia\n. We recommend\nsoaking beans\nin water salted with 1 tablespoon of kosher salt per quart. Also please note that parboiled long-grain rice is a specific rice product available at grocers and supermarkets everywhere; you can not substitute other kinds of rice for it, nor attempt to parboil your own.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nHoppin' John can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat in an oven-safe dish, covered, in a 325\u00b0F oven until warmed through.\nSoul Food & Southern\nBeans Sides\nRice & Grains\nBeans\nWhite Rice",
