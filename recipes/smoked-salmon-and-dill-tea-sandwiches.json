Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a rolling pin, gently flatten each slice of bread; be careful not to over-compress it, you just want to get some of the loft out. Make 4 stacks of 2 slices each and trim the crusts off each (by stacking before trimming, you will ensure each tea sandwich is cut to the same size).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWorking with 2 slices of bread at a time, spread an even layer of cream cheese on top of each, making sure to cover the slices from edge to edge. Neatly arrange slices of salmon on top of 1 of the slices, also making sure to cover the slice from edge to edge. Top with the second slice, cream cheese side down. Repeat with the remaining slices of bread to make 4 tea sandwiches, then cut each in half diagonally to form triangles. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSandwiches\nBritish\nNo-Cook\nSalmon\nDill"
