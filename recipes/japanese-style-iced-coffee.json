  "full_text": "Japanese-Style Iced Coffee\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nActive\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nServes\n2 servings\nMakes\n16 fluid ounces\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8\nounces\n(\n225\ng\n)\nice\n1\nounce\n(\n30\ng\n)\nmedium-coarse ground coffee\n(about the size of Diamond Crystal kosher salt)\n8\nounces\n(\n225\ng\n) near-boiling\nwater\n(roughly 200\u00b0F or 93\u00b0C)\nDirections\nSet a carafe large enough to hold 16 fluid ounces (475ml) of brewed coffee on a digital scale and tare scale to zero. Add 8 ounces (225g) ice. Set a dripper cone on top. Line with paper filter and add the ground coffee. Tare scale to zero once more.\nPour just enough near-boiling water onto grounds to wet them, then let stand 30 seconds (this is called blooming the coffee and will improve the flavor of the final brew). Resume pouring near-boiling water all over grounds until the scale reads 8 ounces (225g). Allow water to fully drain through filter, then discard used coffee grounds. Serve iced coffee right away.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nSpecial Equipment\nDigital scale\n(preferably a\ncoffee scale\n),\npour-over coffee brewer\nof your choice along with paper filters that fit your brewer\nNotes\nYou can also use an electric coffee brewer: Simply fill the carafe with the correct amount of ice, then set up your brewer with the correct amount of coffee and fill the water tank with the correct amount of water, then brew the coffee; if your coffee maker has a warming plate, be sure to turn it off.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nJapanese-style iced coffee is best enjoyed freshly brewed.\nRead More\nCold Brew Iced Coffee Recipe\nVietnamese Coffee Recipe\nFrapp\u00e9 (Foamy Iced Coffee) Recipe\nMazagran Coffee (Iced Coffee Lemonade) Recipe\nCoffee\nJapanese\nBreakfast & Brunch\nDrinks"
