Cook, swirling the pan to ensure even caramelization, until the mixture bubbles vigorously and becomes slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking until light smoke comes off the pan and color changes from light to dark amber very quickly, about 2 minutes longer. Remove pan from heat and stir in coconut water. If the mixture looks like it\u2019s seizing, return pan to low heat and stir gently until sugar is fully dissolved. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nMeanwhile, for the Braise:\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine shrimp, half of shallot, half of garlic, sugar, salt, chiles, and pepper, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nWipe out pan and return to medium-high heat. Heat oil until shimmering, then add remaining shallot and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add caramel sauce and fish sauce and let simmer until sauce has reduced by half, 7 to 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats /Vy Tran\nAdd shrimp and marinade ingredients and toss to coat. Continue cooking on medium-high heat until shrimp turn opaque and are cooked through, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat, season with more freshly ground black pepper, and let rest for 5 minutes before serving with rice and vegetables.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nNotes\nIf you don\u2019t have coconut water, water works just fine. (Do not substitute with sweetened or flavored coconut water.)\nOn its own, this dish should taste intensely sweet and salty, so serve it with rice and another vegetable or soup to temper the flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nT\u00f4m rim keeps well and can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Reheat the dish on medium heat to allow the shrimp to warm through. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a splash of water to loosen.\nVietnamese\nThe Latest\nShrimp\nSoutheast Asian",
