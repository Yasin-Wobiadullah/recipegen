Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking. Meanwhile, make mushroom mixture.\nPlace a large plate in the freezer. Place half the mushrooms in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until very finely chopped, about 10 short pulses, scraping down sides and redistributing mushrooms with a spatula as necessary. Transfer to a bowl. Thinly slice remaining mushrooms and set aside until assembling pizzas.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chopped mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have exuded all their liquid and start to sizzle, about 8 minutes. Continue cooking until mushrooms begin to brown and leave browned bits stuck to bottom of pan, about 4 minutes longer. Add shallot and minced thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 2 minutes.\nAdd cognac or brandy. Scrape bottom of skillet with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon to release browned bits. Continue to cook until brandy is nearly dry, about 4 minutes. Add soy sauce and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper and transfer mixture to the chilled plate. Spread into a thin, even layer and refrigerate until fully cooled, about 10 minutes.\nAdjust oven rack to 6 inches under broiler and place stone or steel on rack. Preheat oven to highest possible temperature (500 to 550\u00b0F or 260 to 290\u00b0C) for at least 45 minutes. Alternatively, use a\nKettlePizza and Baking Steel grill insert\non an outdoor grill.\nWhen ready to bake, turn one dough ball out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into a rough 8-inch circle, leaving the outer 1 inch higher than the center. Gently stretch dough into a 10- to 12-inch circle, about 1/4 inch thick, by draping over knuckles and gently stretching. Transfer to floured wooden pizza peel.\nPreheat broiler to high. Dollop 1/4 of mushroom mixture over the surface of the pizza, followed by 1/4 of mozzarella pieces. Scatter 1/4 of sliced mushrooms over pizza and scatter with 1/4 of whole thyme leaves and 1/4 of sliced garlic. Season with salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTransfer pizza to hot stone or steel and broil, rotating regularly for even cooking, until edges are puffed and lightly charred and bottom is crisp, 3 to 6 minutes total. Retrieve pizza with a metal peel and transfer to a cutting board. Allow to rest 1 minute. Meanwhile, switch oven back to 550\u00b0F to reheat stone for remaining pizzas.\nDrizzle with truffle oil (if using) and serve immediately.\nRepeat steps 6 through 9 with remaining pizzas.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, wood and metal\npizza peels\n,\npizza cutter\n,\nBaking Steel\n(see note)\nNotes\nFor best results, bake pizza using a\nKettlePizza and Baking Steel setup\n.\nRead More\nThe Essential Tools for Homemade Pizza\nThe Comprehensive Mushroom Shopping Guide\nGrilled Pizza With Grilled Shiitake, Soppressata, and Parmesan\nNew York Style Pizza with Kimchi, Soppressata, and Maitake Mushrooms\nPizza\nMozzarella\nCremini & Button Mushrooms\nPortobello Mushrooms\nShiitake Mushroom",
