Dry pork cheeks and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add them to the pan in batches, taking care not to crowd the meat. Cook until the surface is browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side, flipping only once or twice so as not to disturb browning. Remove with tongs to a plate and brown remaining cheeks, adding more oil if needed. Set aside.\nPreheat oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Add onions, carrots, and celery to Dutch oven and saut\u00e9 until softened but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add wine, tomato, and rosemary. Return pork cheeks to pan, stir to combine, and bring the mixture to a simmer.\nCover pan and transfer to oven. Braise until meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Allow meat to cool and settle in liquid (for best results, cover and refrigerate overnight). Skim fat from surface and reheat gently. Serve with pasta or polenta.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nRead More\nSichuan Braised Pork Cheeks Recipe\nPork Mains\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork",
