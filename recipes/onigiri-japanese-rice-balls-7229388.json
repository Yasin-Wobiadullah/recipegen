Using your hands, vigorously swish rice until water turns cloudy, about 30 seconds. Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain the rice, discarding the cloudy water. Refill the bowl with cool water, and repeat rinsing and draining process until the water runs clear. Transfer drained rice to a 4-quart pot or rice cooker, cover with 2 3/4 cups (650ml) water, and cook the rice according to package or rice cooker directions.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo Assemble:\nSet up an assembly line. Place all your fillings on a rimmed baking sheet to your left, and cover the work surface in front of you with plastic wrap. In a medium bowl, stir to dissolve 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in 1 1/2 cups of warm water. (This will prevent the rice from sticking to your fingers and help to season the onigiri.) Place this bowl, along with the vessel of cooked rice, uncovered, on a heat-proof mat, towards the top of your plastic-covered surface.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nLine a large plate or another rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap and set this to your right (this is where your finished onigiri will go; the plastic will prevent the onigiri from sticking to the baking sheet).\nIf using an onigiri mold,\nscoop about 1/3 cup (65g) of rice into a 7.5- by 4.5-centimeter onigiri mold. Using wet hands, pat the rice into the mold. Wet your finger and use it to make a small indentation in the center of the rice ball, and fill it with 1 to 2 teaspoons of your desired filling. Top filling with an additional 1 to 2 teaspoons of rice. Cover with the lid and gently but firmly press down. Remove the lid, then press the button on the back of the mold to release the shaped rice ball. Using wet hands, transfer the onigiri to the prepared baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining rice and fill with your desired fillings.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIf using your hands\n,\nscoop about 1/3 cup (65g) of rice onto the plastic wrap and, using wet hands, gently and firmly shape the rice into a triangle. Use the palm of your hand to flatten slightly. Using a tip of a small spoon or a wet finger, make a small indentation in the center of the rice ball, and fill it with 1 to 2 teaspoons of your desired filling. Top filling with an additional 1 to 2 teaspoons of rice, pressing to seal. Using wet hands, cup your hands around the onigiri to press it more firmly into a triangle. (It is essential to press firmly to make sure the grains stick to one another and the onigiri can hold its shape.) Transfer the onigiri to a plate or the prepared baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining rice and fill with your desired fillings.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo (optionally) coat the outside of your onigiri in furikake, place the furikake in a shallow bowl and dip each side of your onigiri into the seasoning until all three sides of the triangle are generously coated.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo (optionally) wrap in nori, place a 1- by 4-inch rectangle of nori on the bottom of the onigiri, then fold upwards to middle of the rice ball. Alternatively, you can wrap the onigiri in a sheet of nori right before eating. (See notes.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nEnjoy onigiri warm or at room temperature within 2 hours of making.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nOnigiri mold (if using)\nNotes\nOnigiri can be made with many different fillings; feel free to make any one (or all) of the suggested fillings in the recipe, or try a different one (see the \"Popular Fillings\" section in the headnote above). To make tuna-mayo, stir together one drained 6-ounce (170g) can good-quality tuna with 2 tablespoons (30ml) Kewpie mayonnaise. For the salted salmon, finely shred 4 ounces (113g) store-bought Japanese-style salted salmon (shiozake) or 1/2 recipe\nhomemade shiozake\n. For the umeboshi filling, pit and finely chop 3 or more umeboshi plums.\nWrapping your onigiri in nori right before eating prevents the seaweed from becoming soggy. To fully wrap the onigiri in nori, cut your nori sheets into 7- by 4.5-inch rectangles. Place the onigiri on the bottom of the sheet with the top of the triangle pointing towards you. Fold the two bottom corners of the nori onto the onigiri, roll the rice ball towards the top, then fold the top two corners over the other side.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnigiri is best enjoyed within 2 hours of making.\nJapanese\nWhite Rice",
