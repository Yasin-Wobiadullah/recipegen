Cover with a damp paper towel and refrigerate until ready to use.\nPrepare a large ice bath. In a medium saucepan, bring stock to a boil over high heat. Add spinach, remaining whole parsley and tarragon leaves, and scallion greens. Press down with a wire mesh spider to submerge. Cook for 30 seconds, then transfer to ice bath and chill completely. Remove stock from heat.\nTransfer blanched greens to the jar of a blender and add 1/2 cup broth. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.\nHeat oil in a heavy 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add rice and cook, stirring and tossing frequently until all liquid is evaporated, fat is bubbling, and rice has begun to take on a pale golden blond color and nutty aroma, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and scallion whites and continue to cook, stirring frequently until aromatic, about 1 minute.\nAdd all but 1 1/2 cups of broth to skillet. Stir rice once, cover, and reduce heat to lowest possible setting.\nCook rice for ten minutes undisturbed. Stir once, shake pan gently to redistribute rice, cover, and continue cooking until liquid is mostly absorbed and rice is tender with just a faint bite, about 10 minutes longer.\nMeanwhile, heat canola or vegetable oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, tossing occasionally, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Add shallot and cook, stirring constantly, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Carefully add 1/4 cup broth, lemon juice, and soy sauce. Remove from heat, toss to combine, season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside.\nRemove lid from risotto, add remaining broth, Increase heat to high and cook, stirring and shaking rice constantly until thick and creamy. Off heat, stir in green puree, lemon zest, chopped parsley, and chopped tarragon. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately on hot plates, topping with mushrooms and their pan juices.\nNotes\nI prefer using Carnaroli rice for its slightly longer grains and firmer texture. Feel free to use any risotto-style rice like Arborio or Vailone Nano.\nRice & Grain Mains\nVegan",
