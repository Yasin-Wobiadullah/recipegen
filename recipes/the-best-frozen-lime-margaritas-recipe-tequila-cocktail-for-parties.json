The base mixture can be doubled before it's placed in the freezer, but you'll need to work in two separate batches when blending. To make simple syrup, combine equal volumes of sugar and water in a small saucepan and heat until the sugar is dissolved.\nMake-Ahead\nThe mixture can be made up to a week in advance and stored in the freezer.\nRead More\nFrozen Mezcal Palomas\nThe Best Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri\nTequila\nMexican\nLime\nCinco de Mayo\nSummer"
