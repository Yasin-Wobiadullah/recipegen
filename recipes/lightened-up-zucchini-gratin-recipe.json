In another bowl, combine the crumbs, walnuts, cheese, and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter with fingertips until the mixture is crumbly. Season with salt and pepper, and spread evenly over the zucchini. Drizzle lightly with olive oil (if using) and cover the baking dish with foil. Place the baking dish on a baking sheet, transfer to oven, then lower oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\nBake, covered, for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
