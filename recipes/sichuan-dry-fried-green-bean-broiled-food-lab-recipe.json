In a medium skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil, remaining whole Sichuan peppercorns, and dried chiles over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until sizzling and aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, scallions, and mustard root and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdjust rack to as close as possible to broiler and preheat broiler to high. In a large bowl, toss green beans with 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and white pepper. Arrange in a single layer on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Broil until beans are blistered and very lightly charred, 2 to 5 minutes depending on strength of broiler. Return beans to bowl.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nUsing a rubber spatula, transfer Sichuan peppercorn mixture to bowl with beans. Add sugar and remaining crushed peppercorns. Toss to coat the beans thoroughly in the mixture and season to taste with more salt and white pepper if desired. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nSkillet\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nSichuan peppercorns can be found in most Asian markets or spice markets or ordered online. Discard any dark black seeds or stems before using (use the reddish brown husks only).\nPreserved mustard stems can be found at a well-stocked Asian grocer either in a fresh refrigerated bulk bin or in cans, or can be ordered whole or shredded online. If you can't find them, a mixture of 2 1/2 tablespoons of minced mild kimchi and 1/2 tablespoon of minced capers will work in its place.\nRead More\n\"Dry-Fried\" Green Beans With Romesco Sauce\nSichuan Dry-Fried Beef\nWok Skills 101: Dry-Frying Basics\nThe Best General Tso's Chicken\nVegetable Stir-Fry\nChinese\nGreen Beans\nVegetable Sides\nEaster Side Dishes",
