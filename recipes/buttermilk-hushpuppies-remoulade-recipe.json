Season to taste and set aside.\nMake hush puppies:\nStir cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cayenne in a medium bowl. Add onion, buttermilk, melted butter, hot sauce, and scallions (if using), and then stir until just combined.\nPour oil into a heavy duty pot to 2 inches deep. Heat over medium high heat until temperature reaches 375\u00b0F. Working in batches, gently roll dough into golf ball-sized balls and carefully lower into hot oil using a slotted spoon. Take care not to crowd pot. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, turning with wooden spoon for even browning, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve warm hush puppies plain or with remoulade dipping sauce.\nSpecial Equipment\nHeavy duty pot\nNotes\nFor varying salt preferences, I've offered a range. I suggest starting with the lesser amount, tasting the batter or one you've fried, and then adding more salt if desired.\nVegetarian Sides\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nFrying\nButtermilk\nSides",
