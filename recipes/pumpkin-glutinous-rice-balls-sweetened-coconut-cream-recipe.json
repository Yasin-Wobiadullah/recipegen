  "full_text": "Bua Loi Fak Thong (Pumpkin Glutinous Rice Balls in Sweetened Coconut Cream)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nCooling Time\n5 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3/4\ncup\nglutinous rice flour\n3/4\ncup\ncooked\npumpkin pur\u00e9e\n1 1/2\ncups\ncoconut milk\n3/4\ncup\ngranulated sugar\n, more or less to taste\n1/4\nteaspoon\nsalt\nDirections\nPlace flour in a small mixing bowl. Knead pumpkin pur\u00e9e\u00a0into it to form a smooth dough. If water is needed, add one teaspoon at a time just until you can form a smooth dough. Working quickly before dough dries out, form dough into smooth 1/3-inch balls and arrange them on a tray, making sure they don't touch each other.\nFill a 4-quart pot with water half way and bring to boil.\nMeanwhile, add coconut milk, sugar, and salt to a 2-quart pot and bring it to a boil on another burner; reduce heat so that coconut milk mixture is barely simmering.\nOnce water is boiling, gently drop all dough balls into it; stirring a couple of times to prevent them from clumping. Once dough balls rise to the top, fish them out with a slotted spoon and transfer them to coconut milk pot. Taste for sweetness. Add more sugar, if necessary. Turn off heat. Allow dessert to cool down to slightly higher than room temperature before serving.\nNotes\nUse nothing but glutinous rice flour (Erawan brand is best). You cannot use regular rice flour, tapioca flour, or anything else.\nThai\nDairy-free Desserts\nVegan Desserts\nCoconut Milk & Cream\nPumpkin",
