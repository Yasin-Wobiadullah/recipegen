In a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente. Using tongs, a strainer, or a spider, transfer pasta to bowl with cheese and butter.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd 1/2 cup hot pasta-cooking water, then, using tongs, toss repeatedly until butter is melted and a creamy, emulsified sauce forms. If pasta seems too dry, add a splash or two of additional pasta water until desired consistency is reached. Season with salt, if necessary. Serve, sprinkling more cheese on top at the table.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStrainer\n,\nspider skimmer\n, or\ntongs\nNotes\nLook for a young Parmigiano-Reggiano, preferably aged for less than 18 months (a younger cheese will be sweeter and less spicy, which works well in this dish). Alternatively, Grana Padano makes a good substitution as it's a very similar cheese to Parmesan, but typically aged less.\nRead More\nHomemade Fresh Pasta\nCacio e Pepe (Spaghetti with Black Pepper & Pecorino Romano)\nGricia, Amatriciana, Carbonara: The Origins of Rome's Pasta\nPasta al Limone\nPasta Burro e Alici (Pasta With Creamy Anchovy-Butter Sauce)\nCreamy Pastas\nItalian\nStovetop Pasta\nParmesan\nPastas"
