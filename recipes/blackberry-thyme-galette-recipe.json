Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nFor the Dough\n: In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt, and thyme and pulse about 5 times to evenly distribute thyme. Add butter and pulse until it is the size of peas. Add cream cheese and pulse until a dough begins to form. Add milk and pulse until dough comes together. Form dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, For the Filling\n: When dough has about 10 minutes left to chill, place blackberries, sugar, tapioca, and lemon juice in a medium mixing bowl and toss to combine. Set aside.\nFor Assembling the Galette\n: Place dough on a lightly floured work surface, then roll out to 12-inch circle. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.\nSprinkle 1 scant tablespoon of sugar over crust evenly. Place fruit on top of dough, mounding in the center and leaving an approximately 2-inch border on all sides. Fold dough edge up and over filling, forming about 10 pleats as you go. Brush dough with egg wash and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon sugar.\nSerious Eats / Carrie Vasios Mullins\nBake galette until filling is bubbling and crust is golden, about 45 minutes. Carefully use the parchment paper to transfer the galette to a wire rack, then slide parchment paper out from underneath. Cool completely. Serve with a dusting of confectioner's sugar and/or a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nrolling pin\n, pastry brush\nRead More\nFreeform Peach Pie (Galette) Recipe\nSimple Pear Galette With Vanilla Recipe\nStrawberry Galette Recipe\nCranberry Crumble Galette\nBlackberry\nBaked Fruit\nPie Dough\nThyme\nPies",
