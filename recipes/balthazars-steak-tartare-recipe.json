Using a very sharp chef\u2019s knife, cut the steak into thin 1/4-inch slices. Stack 3 of the slices and slice lengthwise, every 1/2 inch, holding the stack in place. Then cut across the stack, again every 1\u20442 inch, cutting the steak into 1\u20442-inch dice. Hold the chopped steak in a bowl set over crushed ice in a larger bowl.\nWhen all of the beef has been chopped, add in the onion, capers, cornichons, parsley, anchovy, oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Gently mix with a fork until just combined. Add the Tartare Mayonnaise and again mix gently until just combined.\nServe on individual plates with baguette slices alongside.\nTartare Mayonnaise\nPut all the ingredients except for the oils in the bowl of food processor. Blend for 30 seconds. With the blade still spinning, drizzle the grapeseed oil in a very slow stream, followed by the olive oil. This should take about 2 minutes. As the mayonnaise forms, the noise from the food processor will become louder, making a slapping sound, as it does with cake batter. Process until the mayonnaise is thick, with a creamy body. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 1 week.\nTo serve with Steak Tartare, add the following ingredients to the prepared Mayonnaise and whisk to smoothly combine:\n1/2 cup ketchup\n3 tablespoons Dijon mustard\n1 tablespoon Tabasco sauce\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nBeef\nNo-Cook"
