Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, toss eggplant with vegetable oil and salt until evenly coated on all sides. Arrange eggplant, cut side down, on prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1/2-inch of space between each piece; set bowl aside, but don\u2019t clean. Roast eggplant until it is browned all over and completely tender, offering little resistance when poked with a paring knife, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating baking sheets back to front and top to bottom halfway through roasting. Set aside until cool enough to handle, 10 to 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in now-empty bowl, whisk together honey, vinegar, sesame oil, fish sauce, doenjang, garlic, and pepper until well combined (dressing will not be fully emulsified). Stir in sesame seeds.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nOnce eggplant is cool enough to handle, using clean hands, tear eggplant pieces lengthwise into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide ribbons, and add to bowl with dressing.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWith one hand, form your fingers into a claw and gently massage dressing into eggplant, swirling your hand around the contents of the bowl but without squeezing the eggplant, until the dressing has been fully absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently fold in scallions. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Serve chilled.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheets\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nGaji-namul can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Serve chilled.\nKorean\nVegetable Sides\nEggplant\nRoasted Vegetables\nThe Latest",
