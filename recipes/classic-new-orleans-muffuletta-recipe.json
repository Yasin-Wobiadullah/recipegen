Pulse to chop until no pieces larger than 1/2-inch remain. Transfer to a bowl. Add olive oil and vinegar and stir to combine. For best results, let olive salad rest overnight before continuing to step 2.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nSplit muffuletta roll in half and spread each cut surface generously with olive salad, making sure to include the juices when spreading. Layer half of soppressata on bottom half of bun, followed by half of mortadella, half of capicola, and half of provolone. Repeat layers with remaining meat and cheese. Close sandwiches and press down gently to compress. For best flavor, wrap tightly in paper or plastic and let rest for 1 hour before serving. Cut into triangular wedges to serve.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nNotes\nGiardiniera is a pickled vegetable mix that can be found in Italian delis or jarred in supermarkets. If unavailable, it can be omitted. Substitute 2 to 3 seeded and stemmed pepperoncini in its place. Muffuletta rolls are difficult to locate outside of New Orleans. If unavailable, use ciabatta or focaccia in its place, or any good bread with a relatively soft crust.\nSandwiches\nItalian-American\nPork"
