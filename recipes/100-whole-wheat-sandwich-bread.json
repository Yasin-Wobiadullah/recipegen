Stir until water is absorbed; then knead briefly against the sides of the bowl until no floury bits remain. Cover and set aside for 2 hours 30 minutes to hydrate flour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Dough:\nTransfer hydrated dough to a 14-cup food processor fitted with the regular metal blade (not the dough blade), along with brown sugar, salt, and instant dry yeast. Process until dough is silky smooth, and a small piece can be stretched into a thin sheet without tearing, about 75 seconds. The exact timing will vary with the power and capacity of a given machine. For smaller machines, the reduced capacity and power will necessitate dividing dough in half to process in stages.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nOnce gluten is well developed, drizzle in the remaining water and oil while the processor is running, and continue mixing only until smooth. At this stage, the dough will feel sticky, wet, and elastic.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFirst Rise:\nTransfer dough to a large, lightly greased bowl (it's fine to reuse bowl from autolyse, no need to wash). Cover and proof until puffy, light, and roughly doubled in bulk, about 2 hours at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). In a chilly kitchen, the dough will need more time to rise, and in a warmer kitchen, it will move faster.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nShaping the Loaf:\nTurn soft dough out onto clean surface lightly dusted with whole wheat flour. Pat dough into 7-inch square, and form into tight log, sealing dough together with heel of your hand. Nestle into lightly greased 1-pound loaf pan, seam side down; cover loosely as before.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSecond Rise:\nLet dough proof until puffy, light, and risen about 2 1/2 inches above rim of pan at very center. To test dough, poke it gently with a flour-dusted fingertip; when dough is ready, it will retain a shallow impression that springs back after a minute. If dough is firm and springs back right away, continue proofing until dough retains a shallow impression. This will take about 75 minutes at around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). Again, timing of the process will vary based on environmental conditions. Near the end of this period, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBaking the Loaf:\nAfter the second rise, uncover dough and bake until well risen, golden brown, and hollow sounding when thumped; about 45 minutes, or to an internal temperature of approximately 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). Immediately turn loaf out onto a wire rack, and cool completely before slicing, at least 90 minutes. Slice with a sharp serrated knife. The loaf will keep up to a week at room temperature in a bread box or paper bag.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\n8-inch aluminized steel loaf pan\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n(optional),\nwire cooling rack\n,\nserrated knife\nNotes\nDue to variations in flour type and milling style, when working with specialty wheat varietals and regional flours, be aware the recipe may require alterations in the hydration level for optimal performance.\nRead More\nMultigrain Sandwich Bread Recipe\n9 Recipes That Make the Most of Nutty, Hearty Whole Wheat Flour\nYeast Breads",
