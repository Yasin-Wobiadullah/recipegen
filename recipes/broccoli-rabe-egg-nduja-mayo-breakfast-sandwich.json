Using a slotted spoon or tongs to drain off excess moisture, evenly divide broccoli rabe between bottom bun halves. Set aside.\nIn a 10-inch cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. (A small drop of water dropped into it should immediately sizzle.) Carefully break eggs into hot oil, dropping them from right above the surface to prevent hot oil from splashing. Season with salt and pepper.\nSlide eggs to back of skillet, opposite handle, and add butter to front of skillet. Once butter has melted and begun to foam, hold skillet handle, and tilt skillet towards you so butter-oil mixture pools near base of handle. Using a spoon, baste eggs with hot fat, aiming at the uncooked portions of the egg whites and avoiding the yolk. Continue basting until eggs are puffy and cooked, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Using a spatula, transfer one egg to each bottom bun half, carefully laying them on top of broccoli rabe. Close sandwiches with top bun halves, and serve immediately.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial equipment\nCast iron\n,\ncarbon steel\n, or nonstick skillet; flexible spatula\nNotes\nIf you would like to keep this recipe dairy-free, omit the butter and add 1 additional tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil to the skillet at the beginning when frying the eggs.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nFried egg sandwiches are best enjoyed right away.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nA Guide to\n'Nduja\n: Italy's Funky, Spicy, Spreadable\nSalume\nBreakfast Sandwich\nEggs\nFried Eggs\nBroccoli Rabe\nEaster"
