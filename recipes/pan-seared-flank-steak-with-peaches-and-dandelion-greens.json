Season flank steak generously with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Heat oil in pan until smoking-hot before carefully placing steak in hot pan, laying it down away from you. Cook steak, pressing the thicker part down with an\noffset spatula\n, small pan, or\ncooking weight\nand flipping every 30 seconds, until it develops a deeply browned crust and internal temperature is about 15\u00b0F away from your desired final temperature, about 8 minutes. (We suggest cooking flank steak to medium doneness, or about 140\u00b0F/60\u00b0C.) Add thyme, garlic, and butter to pan and lower heat to medium. Using a large spoon, baste steak with butter until it is 5\u00b0F away from your desired final temperature, about 4 minutes. Remove steak to a sheet tray fitted with a wire rack, pouring butter and aromatics over steak. Set aside to rest.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReturn same pan to high heat and place peaches in pan, pressing cut sides of peaches onto the brown bits developed from cooking the steak. Sear peaches until golden brown, about 1 minute.\nAdd 1/2 cup (120ml) water to pan and use it to scrape up all the browned bits from the pan to form a pan sauce. Add Calabrian chile, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of the steak drippings to the pan, simmering and swirling to emulsify the sauce. Add dandelion greens and cook until gently wilted, about 1 minute. Slice steak and serve right away with greens, peaches, and sauce.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch cast iron skillet\nor 12-inch heavy-gauge\nstainless steel skillet\n, sauce spoon,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire cooling rack\nRead More\nEasy One-Pan Broiled Steak With Mushrooms and Cabbage\nBroiled Strip Steak With Mushrooms and Chive Sour Cream\nBeefsteak Donburi (Japanese Rice Bowl) With Spinach\nSheet-Pan Skirt Steak Fajitas\nFlank Steaks\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop Beef\nPeach\nQuick Dinners"
