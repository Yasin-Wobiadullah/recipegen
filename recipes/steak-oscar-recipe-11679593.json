Microwave panko, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes; let cool completely. Stir in chives, lemon zest, and pepper flakes; set aside (Topping can be refrigerated for up to 2 days; bring to room temperature before using.)\nSerious Eats /Two Bites\nFor Preparing the Steaks:\nPat steaks dry with paper towels. Season liberally with salt. Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 40 minutes and up to 2 hours. Alternatively, place salted steaks on a plate or on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for up to 24 hours.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nFor the B\u00e9arnaise Sauce:\nIn a small saucepan, combine wine, vinegar, shallots, tarragon stems, and black peppercorns, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Adjust heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until reduced to about 1 tablespoon of liquid, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully strain liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a small heatproof bowl, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Let mixture cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nIn a tall-sided cup that barely fits the head of an immersion blender, combine egg yolks and the wine-vinegar reduction. Using an immersion blender, blend mixture until well-combined, about 30 seconds. (Alternatively, a traditional blender can be used.)\nSerious Eats / \ufeffTwo Bites\nIn a small saucepan, melt butter with cayenne over high heat, swirling constantly, until foaming subsides. Transfer butter to a 1-cup liquid measuring cup.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nPlace head of immersion blender into the bottom of cup with egg yolk mixture and turn it on. With blender constantly running, slowly pour hot butter into cup in a thin and steady stream. Continue blending, raising and lowering blender head slightly to fully emulsify butter with the egg yolk mixture, until a thick and creamy sauce forms. It should be able to coat a spoon but still flow off of it; if it is too thick, blend in a small amount of water to thin it out. Stir in minced tarragon and season to taste with salt. Transfer to a small lidded pot and keep in a warm place, off heat, for up to 1 hour before serving. B\u00e9arnaise cannot be cooled and reheated. (See notes.)\nSerious Eats /Two Bites\nFor Cooking the Steaks\n: In a 10-inch stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet, heat oil over high heat until just smoking. Season steaks with pepper, add to pan, and cook, flipping with tongs every 2 minutes until well browned on all sides (including edges, which you can sear by holding steaks sideways with tongs) and the internal temperature has reached 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) for rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium (steak will continue to cook for a bit afterward), 6 to 12 minutes depending on thickness. Transfer steaks to a plate; set aside and let rest while preparing asparagus and crab. Do not wipe skillet clean.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nFor the Asparagus:\nIn now-empty skillet, combine asparagus, 2 tablespoons water, and oil. Cover and cook over high heat, shaking skillet occasionally to roll asparagus around, until asparagus are bright green and nearly tender, 3 to 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nContinue to cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until water has evaporated and spears are tender and beginning to brown in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Toss with lemon juice and chives and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nFor the Crab:\nIn now-empty skillet, lower temperature to medium and melt butter. Add garlic, stirring constantly, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add crab and cook, stirring gently, until warmed through and coated with butter and garlic, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and gently toss with lemon juice and paprika, if using.\nSerious Eats /Two Bites\nTo Plate and Serve:\nOn 2 warmed serving plates, arrange asparagus in the center of each plate. Top each portion with one filet. Using a spoon, top filets with crab mixture. Spoon b\u00e9arnaise over top and sprinkle each serving with about 1 tablespoon seasoned breadcrumbs right before serving.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nSpecial Equipment\nSmall saucepan; tall-sided cup (for blending with immersion blender); 1-cup liquid measuring cup; immersion blender; 10-inch stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet\nNotes\nAn equivalent total weight of bone-in or boneless ribeye, strip steak, porterhouse, T-bone, hanger, or flank steak can be used in place of filet mignon. Try to get steaks at least 1 1/2 inches thick. If using a thinner cut of steak, shorten cooking time accordingly.\nThe b\u00e9arnaise sauce can be held warm in a double boiler over recently simmering water but off the heat. If the double boiler is left to steam unchecked, the sauce can break easily.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe breadcrumb topping can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and stored in an airtight container at room temperature.\nThe b\u00e9arnaise sauce can be prepared up to 1 hour in advance of serving and stored in a warm place (see notes above).\nTenderloin Steak\nThe Latest\nBeef Mains\nValentine's Day"
