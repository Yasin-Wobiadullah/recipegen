  "full_text": "Cream Cheese and Chive Pastry Pinwheels Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n30 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nFreezing and Cooling Time\n70 mins\nTotal\n110 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nsheet\npuff pastry\n, thawed but cold\n12\nounces\ncream cheese\nor chevre, softened\n3/4\ncup\nminced herbs\n, packed (such as chives, dill, parsley, or tarragon)\nOptional additions:\nlemon zest\n, finely minced garlic\nDirections\nOn a floured work surface, roll puff pastry out to between 1/16 and 1/8 inch thickness, about a 16 by 16 inch square. With an icing or offset spatula, spread cream cheese in a thin layer across pastry, leaving 1 inch of one side bare. Evenly sprinkle on herbs (as well as any optional additions) and add salt.\nStarting with the side opposite the bare 1 inch of pastry, roll pastry into a log. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in freezer for about an hour, or until log is very firm but not rock hard.\nTen minutes before retrieving log from freezer, heat oven to 375\u00b0F, with one rack in the upper third and another rack in the bottom third. Using a sharp knife, cut log into 1/4 inch slices and arrange on two parchment-lined aluminum baking sheets.\nBake for 15 minutes, then rotate pans on racks and continue to bake until pastry is well-browned and crisp to the touch, about another 15 minutes. Transfer pinwheels to a cooling rack lined with paper towels to cool and drain before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nTo store, transfer pinwheels to a large, airy container and leave loosely covered in a cool dry place. Pinwheels will keep several days at room temperature. Frozen as a log, pastry will keep for weeks.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Use Up Leftover Herbs\nPastries\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nSavory\nCheese\nChives",
