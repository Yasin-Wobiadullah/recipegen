Add chorizo and continue to cook until it's lightly browned and oil takes on a deep-orange hue, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pork belly, chorizo, and garlic to a medium bowl and set aside; discard garlic.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIncrease heat to medium-high and heat until shimmering. Add bell and Anaheim peppers to skillet, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until pepper skins are lightly blistered and browned, about 3 minutes. Add kale to skillet, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until kale is slightly wilted and softened, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to bowl with pork belly and chorizo. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd bread in an even layer to skillet, drizzle water over top, and cook, stirring frequently with metal spatula to evenly coat with oil mixture. Season with salt to taste, and continue to cook, stirring and breaking up bread into smaller pieces with spatula, while occasionally scraping bottom of the skillet to prevent bread from sticking and scorching. Continue to cook, stirring and scraping frequently, until mixture is broken down into small crumbs, 1- to 2-inch pieces, and bread is light golden brown and crisp but not hard, 15 to 20 minutes. If bread begins to get too dark, reduce heat to medium-low and sprinkle bread with additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo finish, sprinkle migas with piment\u00f3n and stir until bread is evenly coated and mixture is aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add vegetable and chorizo mixture to skillet, stir to combine and season to taste with salt. Remove from heat. If serving with fried eggs, transfer migas to serving bowl and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Wipe out skillet and\nfry eggs\n. Divide migas into individual bowls, sprinkle with parsley, and top with fried eggs. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nIt is worth seeking out real-deal Spanish piment\u00f3n de la Vera for this dish. Like Parmigiano-Reggiano, this smoked paprika from Extremadura is a product with a Protected Designation of Origin status in the EU. It can be found in various levels of heat\u2014 dulce (sweet), agridulce (literally \"sweet and sour\" but in the middle ground of spiciness), and picante\n(hot).\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron skillet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nSausages\nSpanish\nStovetop Sausages\nKale\nPeppers",
