In a medium bowl, combine ground meat with olive oil, salt, black pepper, cumin, and cinnamon. Using a clean hand, knead until very well combined and meatball mixture feels slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.\nJillian Atkinson\nUsing clean, lightly oiled hands, roll meatball mixture into grape-size balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet (you should have about 30 meatballs).\nJillian Atkinson\nBake meatballs just until starting to brown, about 5 minutes.\nJillian Atkinson\nFor the Soup:\nIn a 3-quart saucepan, bring chicken stock to a boil along with cinnamon, allspice, and black pepper, then lower heat to hold a simmer. Taste the broth, then season with salt to your liking. (If using store-bought broth, follow additional instructions in note.)\nJillian Atkinson\nAdd the rice and the meatballs to broth and simmer just until the rice has softened slightly and the flavours have a chance to meld, 5 to 10 minutes.\nJillian Atkinson\nTo serve, place several meatballs in each bowl, then ladle the rice and broth on top. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve immediately.\nJillian Atkinson\nNotes\nIf you are using store-bought broth, add 1 small onion, 1 clove of garlic, and 1 bay leaf along with the spices and let it simmer for about 10 additional minutes to infuse; discard aromatics, then continue with recipe.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe finished soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat gently before serving.\nSoups\nWhite Rice\nMiddle Eastern\nMeatballs\nThe Latest"
