On a rimmed baking sheet, spread eggplant, bell pepper, shallot, and jalape\u00f1o in an even layer. Sprinkle cumin and coriander seeds on top, season lightly with salt, and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Using your hands, toss to coat vegetables well, then cook until lightly charred, about 45 minutes. Let cool completely. Once vegetables are cool, remove and discard some (but not all) of the charred skin. Transfer vegetables to a medium bowl.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, combine lentils with 2 cups (480ml) water and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until lentils are completely tender but not falling apart, about 15 minutes. Drain lentils through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding the cooking water, and let cool to room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, place cashews in a small heatproof bowl, cover by at least 2 inches of boiling water, and let soak for 30 minutes. Drain cashews through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding the soaking water, and add to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd roasted vegetables, lentils, garlic, and lemon or lime juice to the food processor bowl. Pulse until a coarse paste forms, 2 to 3 5-second pulses. Season with salt to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with parsley or cilantro, drizzle remaining oil on top, and serve with warm crackers, flatbread, or buttered slices of toasted sourdough bread.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nDip can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. To serve, bring dip to room temperature or warm in a microwave.\nEggplant\nThe Latest\nDips\nBell Peppers",
