Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a 2-quart saucier or saucepan, combine coconut milk, whole milk, and vanilla extract. Set over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and, while whisking constantly, slowly pour milk into egg yolk mixture in a thin stream until all of it has been added.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nReturn the mixture to the same saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the custard begins to thicken, about 4 minutes. Once it thickens, continue to whisk, pausing every few seconds to check for bubbles, about 1 minute. When it begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nRemove from heat, then strain the custard through a fine-mesh strainer set over a heatproof medium bowl. Fold in sweetened shredded coconut and immediately place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard.

Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the custard and refrigerate until set, about 4 hours.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\n30 minutes before you plan to serve the pie, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00baF (175\u00baC). Spread flaked coconut on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, shaking the pan occasionally, until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Remove from oven and allow coconut to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen ready to serve, top pie with whipped cream and garnish with toasted flaked coconut.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n2 medium heat-proof bowls, 2-quart saucier or saucepan, whisk, fine-mesh strainer, rimmed baking sheet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe pie crust can be made and filled with custard up to three days in advance; top with whipped cream and toasted flaked coconut just before serving.\nPies\nThe Latest\nDesserts\nCoconut"
