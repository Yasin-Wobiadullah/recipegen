Add almonds and beat and crush into a rough paste. Work in basil leaves and mint (if using), pounding and crushing into tiny bits. Smash in cheese, followed by tomatoes and olive oil. The final sauce should be a rough paste. Season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIf Using a Food Processor:\nPulse garlic with almonds until roughly chopped. Add basil, mint (if using), cheese, tomatoes, and olive oil and process to a rough paste. Season with salt.\nTransfer 2/3 of the sauce to a large heatproof serving bowl.\nIn a pot of salted boiling water, cook linguine until al dente. Transfer pasta to serving bowl, reserving some of the pasta-cooking water. Toss well, adding more olive oil and pasta-cooking water, one tablespoon at a time each, until a creamy sauce forms that's not dry but also not soupy. Season with salt, if needed. If the sauce gets too dry at any point, simply add more pasta-cooking water to loosen it.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe, spooning remaining sauce on top of each portion and adding more cheese as desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle\nor\nfood processor\nNotes\nIf you can find them, pizzuta d'Avola almonds from Sicily are an excellent choice here, adding a slightly bitter, more aromatic flavor to the sauce.\nRead More\nThe Best Pesto alla Genovese (Classic Basil Pesto Sauce)\nHow to Blanch Almonds\nThe Best Ways to Peel and Dice Tomatoes | Knife Skills\nPesto\nItalian\nAlmonds\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine\nPasta Mains"
