Place on high heat and let sugar melt and begin to caramelize. As sugar caramelizes, the bubbles will shrink and pile on each other. The caramel is nearly ready when bubbling significantly slows and the syrup is the color of an old penny, a dark amber. Do not stir the pot at this point.\nCaramel will begin to smoke; let it for three seconds and then stir in half-and-half and turn off heat. If caramel seizes, heat on low and stir till dissolved.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks, duck fat, and soy sauce till thoroughly combined. Ladle in about 1/3 of the caramel mixture, whisking constantly, to temper eggs. Then return egg mixture to saucepan. Heat custard on low, stirring frequently, until custard coats the back of a spoon and a finger swipe leaves a clean line. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla, and transfer to an airtight container. Chill overnight in refrigerator.\nCustard may curdle slightly overnight. Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into an ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer instructions. Chill in a cold freezer, 3 hours for a soft serve and 8 to 12 for a firmer ice cream. Sprinkle with a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg just before serving. Ice cream will melt quickly once scooped.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nDuck\nIce Cream"
