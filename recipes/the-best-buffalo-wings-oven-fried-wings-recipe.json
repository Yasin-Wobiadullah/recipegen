Carefully dry chicken wings with paper towels. In a large bowl, combine wings with baking powder and salt and toss until thoroughly and evenly coated. Place on rack, leaving a slight space between each wing. Repeat with remaining 2 batches of wings.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nPlace baking sheet with wings in refrigerator and allow to rest, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nAdjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Add chicken wings and cook for 20 minutes. Flip wings and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, 15 to 30 minutes longer, flipping a few more times towards the end.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nMeanwhile, combine butter and hot sauce in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking until combined. Transfer wings to a large bowl, add sauce, and toss to thoroughly coat. Serve wings immediately with blue cheese dressing and celery sticks, conspicuously shunning anyone who says that real Buffalo wings must be fried.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire cooling rack\nNotes\nThis recipe easily scales up and down. For every pound of chicken wings, use the following amounts of the other ingredients:\n1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder\n1 teaspoon (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt\n2 tablespoons (25g) unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons (30ml) Frank\u2019s RedHot Sauce\nChicken Wings\nNorth American\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nSavory\nSnacks & Appetizers"
