Set on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and allow to air-dry, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, crack peppercorns into rough halves and quarters. You can use a pepper mill set to its coarsest setting (though not all pepper mills will crack coarsely enough); a mortar and pestle (though some peppercorns will jump out as you try to crush them); or, perhaps best, a large mallet, meat pounder, or skillet to crush them (wrap the peppercorns in a clean kitchen towel first to contain them).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Spread cracked peppercorns on a plate or in another shallow dish and firmly press one side of each steak into the pepper to encrust it in an even layer. Set each steak aside, peppercorn side up. Reserve any remaining cracked peppercorns. (Exactly how much pepper adheres will depend on the dimensions of the steaks. You should have some pepper remaining, but if not, you can crack more to completely coat one side of each steak.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add steaks, peppercorn side down, and cook until peppercorns are well toasted, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn steaks, trying not to break the peppercorn crust. Add butter, thyme, and garlic and cook, basting steaks with a spoon, until steaks are well seared on the second side. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer steaks to a rimmed baking sheet. Using an instant-read thermometer, check the internal temperature of the steaks; if they've reached 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C), they're ready to be served medium-rare. If they haven't reached their final doneness temperature (which will depend heavily on the dimensions of the steaks), transfer to oven and continue cooking until the correct internal temperature is reached. Either way, allow steaks to rest for 5 minutes once the final doneness temperature is reached.\nPour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from skillet and discard garlic and thyme. Add shallot and any reserved cracked peppercorns, return to medium heat, and cook, stirring, until shallot is tender, about 2 minutes.\nAdd brandy or cognac. (To prevent an unexpected flare-up if working over gas, you can turn off the burner, add the alcohol, then reignite the burner.) Cook until raw alcohol smell has burned off and brandy has almost completely evaporated.\nAdd chicken stock and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping up any browned bits. Whisk in cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, then simmer, stirring often, until sauce has reduced enough to glaze a spoon. Whisk in mustard. Season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nArrange steaks on plates and pour sauce on top. Serve with\nFrench fries\n,\nmashed potatoes\n, or other sides of your liking.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\n,\npepper mill\nor\nmortar and pestle\n(optional),\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nHeavy cream makes a more delicate, sweeter sauce that better showcases the peppercorn flavor, while cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche adds a layer of tangy complexity to the sauce.
