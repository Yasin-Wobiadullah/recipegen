Add ghee and, using your hands, rub it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Slowly add milk in small increments, using your hands to mix it in until a firm yet supple dough forms (you may not need the entire 1/2 cup milk). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rest for 30 minutes.\nPlace dough on a work surface and divide into 4 portions. Working with one portion at a time, and keeping the rest covered with plastic to prevent drying, use a rolling pin to roll out each portion into a sheet a little less than 1/8-inch-thick (about 2 to 3mm). Using a knife, cut a crosshatch pattern across each sheet of dough to create small diamond shapes.\nIn a heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 inches oil to 365\u00b0F (185\u00b0C); when oil is hot enough, a test piece of dough should sizzle and float to the surface immediately upon being placed in the pot. Place several pieces of dough in oil at a time and fry, flipping pieces midway through, until both sides are a deep golden brown, about 2 minutes.\nUsing a spider, slotted spoon, or strainer, transfer fried dough pieces to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining dough pieces. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nSpecial equipment\nRolling pin, heavy-bottomed pot,\ninstant-read thermometer\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe shankarpali can be stored in an airtight container at cool room temperature for up to 4 days.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nShining a Light on Diwali Treats: An Opinionated Guide\nSnacks & Appetizers\nIndian\nFrying\nDiwali"
