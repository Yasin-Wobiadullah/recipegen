Gently pull the peel back and discard. Slice each avocado lengthwise into 8 pieces. Working with one avocado slice at a time, dip in the lightly beaten egg to coat, then lift and allow excess to drip off. Transfer to the panko mixture and gently toss to coat well. Transfer to a platter and repeat with remaining avocado slices.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nPreheat air fryer to 350\u00baF (175\u00baC) on the air fry setting.
