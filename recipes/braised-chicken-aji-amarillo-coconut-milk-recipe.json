Add coconut oil to a 6-quart Dutch oven or similar heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pot and heat over medium-high heat until oil shimmers. Season chicken thighs with salt and sear, skin side down, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip chicken and sear on other side until browned, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside. Drain any excess fat from pot and lower heat to medium.\nAdd sliced onion and minced garlic to pot and cook, scraping up any browned bits from the chicken, until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIncrease heat to high, then add coconut milk, aj\u00ed amarillo, and squash and bring to a simmer. Season with salt. Return chicken to pot along with any accumulated juices, resting it skin side up on top of squash so that skin remains above the surface of the liquid.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer pot to oven and bake, uncovered, until chicken is cooked through and squash is tender, about 45 minutes.\nRemove from oven and stir in peas and cilantro. Serve right away with rice or boiled yuca.\nNotes\nAj\u00ed amarillo can be found in Peruvian and Mexican grocery stores, as well as online. Adjust the amount of chile paste in this dish based on your taste, keeping in mind that the heat will mellow out after cooking. If you cannot find aj\u00ed amarillo, any other chile paste will also work well.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nSouth American\nChicken Thighs\nCoconut Milk & Cream\nPeas"
