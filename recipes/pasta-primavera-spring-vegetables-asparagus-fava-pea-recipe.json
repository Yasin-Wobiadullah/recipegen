Discard pods. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Working with one vegetable at a time, blanch favas, peas, asparagus, snap peas, and broccolini in boiling water for 1 minute each, transfer to ice bath to cool, then transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined tray and pat dry. Remove and discard skin from each individual fava bean. Set vegetables aside. Empty pot, refill it with fresh water, season generously with salt, and return to a boil.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nMeanwhile, in a 3- to 4-quart saucier or a 12-inch skillet, heat butter, olive oil, garlic, and pine nuts over low heat until gently sizzling. Cook, swirling pan constantly, until pine nuts just start to brown and garlic aroma is very strong. Do not let butter brown; remove it from heat occasionally if it starts to sizzle too rapidly. Discard garlic cloves. Add blanched vegetables to pan and toss to combine. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nWhen water is boiling, add pasta and cook until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute total for most fresh pasta (see note). Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Transfer pasta to pan with vegetables and add cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, lemon zest, lemon juice, basil, and parsley. Set over high heat and cook, stirring and tossing constantly and adjusting the consistency as necessary with a few splashes of the starchy pasta water, until liquid reduces to a creamy sauce. The sauce should coat the pasta and leave a creamy trail on the bottom of the pan when you drag a wooden spoon through it.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nOff heat, stir in a generous shaving of fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, drizzling with olive oil and sprinkling with freshly ground black pepper and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano at the table.\nSpecial Equipment\n3- or 4-quart saucier\nor\n12-inch skillet\nNotes\nFresh egg pasta is ideal for this dish. If you opt for a long pasta shape like fettuccine,\nconsider making your own\n. Of course, you can always substitute dried pasta in this recipe: Cook 12 ounces of dried pasta for 1 to 2 minutes less than the package directions indicate before adding it to the pan with the vegetables in step 3.\nRead More\nGrilled Pasta Primavera\nPenne With Melted-Vegetable Sauce\nCreamy Orecchiette With Spring Onions, Fennel, and Bacon\nPasta chi Vruoccoli Arriminati (Sicilian\u00a0Pasta With Cauliflower and Toasted Breadcrumbs)\nPasta Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Pasta\nVegetables\nQuick Dinners"
