Place one cheese slice on top of one slice of bread. Top with guacamole and second cheese slice. Close sandwich, with both toasted sides facing inwards.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nMelt one more piece of butter in the skillet and reduce heat to medium-low. Add sandwich and cook, swirling occasionally, until deep, even golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove sandwich using a flexible metal spatula. Add the remaining butter. Return sandwich to skillet cooked-side up. Season with salt. Cook, swirling occasionally, until second side is deep, even golden brown and cheese is thoroughly melted, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nNonstick skillet\nNotes\nI like to add tomato to\nmy basic guacamole recipe\nfor this application. Grilled cheese and tomato is just classic. If you want to go one step further, add some crispy bacon to the sandwich.\nRead More\nCrispy Grilled Cheese Sandwich\nGrilled Cheese Sandwich\nSandwiches\nVegetarian Mains\nCheddar Cheese\nQuick Dinners",
