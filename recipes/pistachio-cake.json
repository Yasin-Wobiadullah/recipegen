Line an 8- by 3-inch anodized aluminum cake pan with parchment (see our explanation and tutorial on\nhow to cut a parchment round\n) and grease lightly with pan spray.\nFor the Cake:\nWhisk sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl for about 1 minute. This dry mixture will look homogeneous well before it truly is, so use patience at this stage and whisk longer than may seem necessary. Under-mixing at this stage can produce dark spots or an uneven texture in the cake.\nAdd orange zest, roasted pistachio oil, buttermilk, egg, and orange flower water and whisk vigorously until batter looks smooth and well emulsified. Sift in cake flour and whisk just until well combined. Scrape into prepared pan. Bake until cake is firm but your finger can still leave an impression in the puffy crust, about 33 minutes. (A toothpick inserted into the center should come away with a few crumbs still attached.)\nCool cake directly in pan about 10 minutes, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off parchment, and place cake right side up on a serving platter or cake stand. Cool to room temperature, and top with homemade pistachio cream and lightly toasted pistachios to taste.\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk\n,\n8- by 3-inch anodized aluminum cake pan\n,\nwire rack\nNotes\nBoth bleached and unbleached cake flour styles will work nicely in this recipe. Bleached styles will improve the cake's rise and create a more tender crumb (as shown here), while unbleached styles will produce a heartier, more rustic texture akin to that of a quick bread.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nWrapped tightly in plastic, the unfrosted cake will keep for 2 or 3 days at cool room temperature.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHomemade Pistachio Paste Opens Up a World of Pistachio Desserts\nCakes\nSheet Cake\nPistachios\nEaster Desserts"
