Heat a 5-6 quart Dutch oven on medium-high heat for three minutes, then add oil. Meanwhile, salt lamb shanks liberally\u2014two to three teaspoons kosher salt per shank. When oil shimmers, brown shanks in oil, in batches, if necessary, until lightly browned on all sides (you do not need a dark sear for this dish).\nSet shanks aside on a plate and add all spices except saffron to pot. Stir frequently to coat with fat until spices become intensely aromatic, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add chicken broth, scraping browned bits off bottom of pan, then apricots, plums, candied ginger, and saffron. Stir to combine, then arrange lamb shanks in a single layer in bottom of pot.\nCover with a heavy, well-fitted lid (or use a sheet of aluminum foil under the lid) and transfer pot to oven and braise for 3 to 3 1/2 hours, or until shanks are meltingly tender and offer a paring knife no resistance.\nTransfer shanks to a serving platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Strain braising liquid and transfer apricots, plums, and candied ginger to serving platter. Let strained liquid sit undisturbed for 10 minutes, then strain fat. Pour over lamb at the table, with a generous squeeze of lemon juice and a light drizzle of pomegranate molasses, to taste.\nSpecial equipment\nheavy 5-6 quart Dutch oven or\ngood-quality tagine\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Add Spice to Your Passover Seder\nLamb Shank\nDairy-free Mains\nBraised & Stewed Lamb\nApricot\nPlum"
