Cover and let soak for 8 to 12 hours. Drain soaked beans.\nHeat oil in a 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, bell pepper, celery, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are soft and translucent but not browned, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and jalape\u00f1o and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes longer.\nAdd thyme, bay leaves, cayenne, stock, smoked turkey, and beans. Stir to combine. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce to a bare simmer. Cook until beans are very soft but not falling apart, 2 to 3 hours. If using smoked turkey leg, remove it now to let cool slightly, then remove skin and pull meat into fine pieces. Remove Dutch oven lid and increase heat to high. Cook beans at a hard simmer, stirring frequently, until broth is reduced to your liking. Add pulled drumstick meat back to pot if using. Season with salt and pepper.\nFor the Rice:\nIn the last half hour of bean-cooking, bring water and butter to a boil over high heat in a heavy-bottomed pot. Stir in rice, reduce to a bare simmer, and cover. Cook until rice is tender and liquid is fully absorbed, about 20 minutes. Serve beans ladled over a pile of rice.\nSpecial Equipment\n5-quart\nDutch oven\nwith a tight, heavy lid\nRead More\nSmoked Turkey Barbecue Sandwiches\nSmoked Turkey Braised Collard Greens\nSides\nCajun & Creole\nSmoked Turkey\nCannellini & Kidney Beans\nWhite Rice"
