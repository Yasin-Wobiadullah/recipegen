Using a fork or stiff rubber spatula, stir and mash mixture vigorously until well-combined and almost no flakes of tuna remain. Season with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nFor Open-Faced Sandwiches:\nPosition oven rack about 6 inches from broiler element, and preheat broiler. Using a pastry brush, lightly but evenly brush both sides of each slice of bread with oil, clarified butter, or melted butter. In a large cast iron or nonstick skillet, or using a griddle, toast bread slices on first side over medium heat until nicely browned and crisp, about 3 minutes; using a cooking weight or spatula, gently press down on bread slices while toasting to ensure even heating and browning.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nFlip bread and lay one slice of cheese on top of each bread slice. Mound tuna salad on top of cheese, spreading it in an even layer, then top each with remaining 2 cheese slices. Continue to cook until bottom of bread is well toasted, then transfer to a baking sheet and broil until cheese is well melted, about 1 minute. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nFor Closed Sandwiches:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Using a pastry brush, lightly but evenly brush both sides of each slice of bread with oil, clarified butter, or melted butter. In a large cast iron or nonstick skillet, or using a griddle, toast bread slices on first side over medium heat until nicely browned and crisp, about 3 minutes; using a cooking weight or spatula, gently press down on bread slices while toasting to ensure even heating and browning.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nFlip bread and lay one slice of cheese on top of each bread slice. Mound tuna salad on top of 2 of the bread slices, spreading it in an even layer. Close sandwiches, placing top bread slices cheese side down, and continue to cook until bottom of sandwich is well toasted; press down gently on sandwich with cooking weights or a spatula to ensure even heating and browning.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nFlip tuna melt and cook until second side is well toasted. If your cheese at this point isn't melted enough, transfer sandwiches to a baking sheet and heat in oven until cheese is well melted, about 3 minutes. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge (12-inch) cast iron pan\n,\nnonstick skillet\n, or a\ngriddle\nNotes\nWe don't often specify brands, but in this classic tuna melt, Hellmann's adds its signature flavor. Feel free to use another preferred brand or\nhomemade\nif you prefer.\nPanko helps make a tuna salad that's light and fluffy and moist without being runny. If you don't have it, do not substitute with another type of bread crumb as they will be too dense. Instead, reduce the mayonnaise from 1/2 cup (120g) to 6 tablespoons (90g).\nFor the fat to toast the bread, a neutral vegetable oil will make very crisp toasts but won't add any flavor; clarified butter will also make very crisp bread with a buttery flavor; melted butter will add buttery flavor too, but its water content will impede crisping slightly. You can use any three by themselves, or toast with oil for maximum crispness and then lightly brush with melted butter for just a bit of that rich dairy flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe tuna salad can be refrigerated in an airtight container overnight.\nRead More\nThe Science of Melting Cheese\nFrench Melt (Grilled Cheese With Caramelized Onion and Comt\u00e9)\nThe Best Patty Melt\nClassic Mayo-Dressed Tuna Salad Sandwiches\nThe Latest\nAmerican\nCheese\nCanned Fish\nSandwiches"
