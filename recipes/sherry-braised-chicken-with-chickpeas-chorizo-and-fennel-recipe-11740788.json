Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Sprinkle all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon paprika.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nPlace chicken, skin side down, into a room-temperature 12-inch nonstick skillet. Set over medium-high heat and cook until fat has rendered and skin is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until second side is browned, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nUsing tongs, transfer chicken to a large plate. Reserve 2 tablespoons rendered chicken fat in skillet, and discard or save any remaining chicken fat for another use.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nHeat skillet with fat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion, fennel, chorizo, bell pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion and fennel are softened and lightly browned, 7 to 9 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nAdd garlic, thyme, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon paprika and cook until aromatic and garlic is just beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in flour and cook until no dry flour remains, 1 minute. Stir in sherry, broth, and chickpeas and bring to a boil. Boil for 3 minutes, then remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nNestle chicken skin side up into skillet along with any accumulated juices. Transfer skillet to oven and cook, uncovered, until chicken registers 185 to 190\u00b0F (85 to 88\u00b0C), 20 to 25 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nTransfer chicken to serving platter. Place skillet with sauce and vegetables over medium-high heat (skillet handle will be hot). Stir in butter and cook until butter is melted and sauce is slightly thickened and glossy, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve chicken, vegetables, and sauce, sprinkled with parsley, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge nonstick skillet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nLeftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. I recommend storing the chicken separately from the sauce and vegetables.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nChicken Thighs\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nMains"
