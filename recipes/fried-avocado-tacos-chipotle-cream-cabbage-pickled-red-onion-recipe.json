Add 3/4 cup beer and whisk very rapidly just until a loose batter is formed. Batter should be lumpy and have the texture of thick paint (add more beer if necessary). Do not overmix.\nSeason avocado wedges generously with salt and pepper, then drop them into the batter and turn to coat. Pick up one wedge at at time, allow excess to drip off, and carefully lower into hot oil. Continue until all wedges have been added and adjust heat as necessary to maintain a temeperature of 350 to 375\u00b0F.\nCook, turning avocado wedges occasionally and agitating oil to promote even cooking, until light golden brown and crisp all over, about 3 minutes total. Using tongs or a wire mesh spider, transfer avocado wedges to a paper towel-lined bowl. Season immediately with salt and toss to drain excess oil.\nTo serve, make 8 stacks of 2 tortillas each. Divide salsa verde and cabbage between tortillas and top with avocados. Drizzle with chipotle cream and top with pickled red onions, Serrano chile, and cilantro. Serve immediately with lime wedges and radish.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok, deep fryer, or Dutch oven\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCook This Now: Deep Fried Avocado Tacos\nVegetarian Mains\nFrying\nAvocado\nCabbage\nOnions"
