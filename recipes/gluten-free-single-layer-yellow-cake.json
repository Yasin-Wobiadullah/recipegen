Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Spray an 8 by 2-inch square cake pan or a 9 by 2-inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set pan aside.\nIn large mixing bowl, whisk together white rice flour, granulated sugar, potato starch, baking powder, salt, and xanthan gum. Add butter, milk (or water), eggs, and vanilla. Using a handheld mixer, mix until a thick batter forms, about 1 minute. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake until cake tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Place cake, in pan, on wire rack to cool. If desired, ice with buttercream icing when cool. (Or glaze with citrus glaze; see note)\nFor the Chocolate Buttercream:\nIn medium bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. In large bowl, beat butter until light. Add powdered sugar-cocoa mixture and milk. Cream until smooth. Adjust thickness, if needed, by adding more milk, one tablespoon at a time. Icing should be thick and spreadable.\nSpecial Equipment\n8 by 2-inch square cake pan or 9 by 2-inch round cake pan\n;\nhand mixer\nNotes\nThis simple layer cake goes well with chocolate buttercream. However, if you don't want to finish the cake with buttercream, a citrus glaze works well. To make, start by zesting your favorite citrus fruit. Then, in a small bowl, combine 1 cup powdered (confectioner's) sugar with 2 tablespoons milk or citrus juice, like lemon or grapefruit. Stir. Add one teaspoon of citrus zest. Thin, as needed, until the glaze is pourable but still thick.\nLayer Cake\nGluten-free Desserts",
