Carefully lower eggs into pot and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer), and continue cooking for 9 minutes for jammy yolks or 11 minutes for hard-cooked yolks. Immediately transfer eggs to ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes, then peel under cool running water. Quarter eggs lengthwise and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Jordan Provost\nMeanwhile, if using fava beans, open up fava bean pods and remove individual beans. Discard pods. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Add fava beans to pot and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer fava beans to ice bath and allow to chill for 1 minute. Carefully peel off and discard the outer skin from each bean and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Jordan Provost\nCore and slice 3/4 pound (340g) of tomatoes into 1/4-inch-thick wedges; set aside. Split remaining 1/2 pound (230g) tomatoes in half horizontally. Set a box grater into a large bowl. Rub cut faces of split tomatoes over the large holes of a box grater, using the flattened palm of your hand to move the tomatoes back and forth. The flesh should be grated off, while the skin remains intact in your hand. Discard skin and season tomato pulp with kosher salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / Jordan Provost\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine fava beans (if using), green pepper rings, artichoke heart (if using), breakfast radish (if using), olives, scallions, and basil leaves. Drizzle generously with olive oil and season with salt to taste, and toss to coat evenly (if desired, you can also mix in a light splash of red wine vinegar).\nSerious Eats / Jordan Provost\nSplit rolls in half horizontally and, using your fingers, scoop out and discard some of the tender crumb from both the top and bottom halves. Rub smashed garlic cloves all over cut sides of top and bottom halves of each roll to infuse the bread with garlic flavor. Discard any remaining garlic,. Spoon grated tomatoes all over cut sides of rolls and drizzle with olive oil (you may not need to use all the grated tomatoes).\nSerious Eats / Jordan Provost\nLightly season sliced tomatoes with salt, then layer the sliced tomatoes, boiled egg quarters, flaked tuna, anchovy fillets, and dressed vegetables onto the bottom halves of each roll. Drizzle generously with additional olive oil, season with pepper (if desired), then close sandwiches, wrap tightly in parchment, foil, or reusable wrappers and let stand at least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Jordan Provost\nNotes\nDepending on where you live, fresh fava beans may not be available at the same time that tomatoes are at their best. If you can find them and want to include them, please do; if not, it's okay to skip.\nThis is a sandwich meant to highlight the best of what's in season, most importantly the tomatoes, along with high-quality canned or jarred tuna and eggs. Much of the rest is optional and up to what your local shopping conditions and personal preferences support. Fava beans come in large pods, but how many beans are in each pod and how large those beans is variable, making it difficult to offer an exact volume.\nYou can use many types of tomato in this sandwich, including plum tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, garden tomatoes, and more. What is most important is that they are high-quality summer tomatoes at the peak of ripeness. This sandwich will suffer from under-ripe supermarket tomatoes or ones that are out of season.\nWhile canned tuna often comes in a 5-ounce can size, not all tuna comes in that size. Ventresca tuna, which is the fattier belly cut that I highly recommend in this sandwich, is sold in a wide range of sizes, from 4.5-ounce tins to 7-ounce jars. Any of these will work as even the smaller size packaging will have enough tuna for the sandwiches.\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nTuna\nEggs",
