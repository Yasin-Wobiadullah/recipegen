Remove from heat, stir in ginger, and let steep covered for 30 minutes. Half and half may separate slightly but it won't affect the final ice cream.\nIn a bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar together until they thicken and lighten in color. When ginger is done steeping, quickly whisk yolk mixture into saucepan. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until custard coats the back of a spoon but a swiped finger leaves a clean line.\nStrain custard into an airtight container. Add white chocolate chunks, and when melt, add salt to taste. Chill custard overnight and churn the next day according to manufacturer's instructions.\nFor the Shortbread Crumble:\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) with a rack in the middle. Melt butter in a small saucepan, then add both sugars and salt until white sugar mostly dissolves. Stir in flour until mixture resembles a thick paste. Do not overmix.\nPat dough out on a sheetpan to 1/4 inch thickness and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, until shortbread is just set. Let cool, then crumble into mixed-size chunks. When ice cream is churned, stir in candied ginger and most of the crumble, reserving some for topping. Let ice cream chill in freezer for at least 2 to 3 hours before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nIce cream machine\nThis Recipe Appears In\nScooped: White Chocolate Ginger Shortbread Ice Cream\nIce Cream\nHeavy Cream\nGinger"
