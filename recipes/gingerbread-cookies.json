Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy, soft, and light, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater about halfway through. In chilly winter months, this process may take longer (see our\nguide to winter baking\nfor more info).\nReduce mixing speed to low and add the flour all at once; continue mixing until well combined. Scrape the bowl and beater well with a flexible spatula, then knead against the sides of the bowl to form a smooth ball. Divide in half and flatten into discs. If comfortable working with a soft dough, use immediately; if not, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cool and firm (timing will vary depending on personal preference). If refrigerated for longer than a few hours, let the dough stand at room temperature until softened to about 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) before use, then knead on a bare, unfloured surface until pliable and smooth.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). On a flour-dusted surface, roll a portion of dough into a 7-inch square. Sprinkle with flour, flip to sprinkle the other side, and continue roll until 1/8 inch thick, repositioning as needed to ensure the dough does not stick. After rolling, brush away the excess flour and slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen before stamping into shapes with assorted cutters. Arrange cut-outs on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, leaving at least 1/4 inch between each. Gather scraps, knead, re-roll, and cut as before (any scraps leftover from this second stage can be baked off to grind as cookie crumbs). Repeat with the remaining portion of dough.\nBake the gingerbread until firm and dry to the touch, about 12 minutes, and cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet. If you like, decorate as desired with royal icing, and dry completely before storage (this can take 12-24 hours depending on thickness of design, ambient humidity, and air flow).\nWith or without frosting, the gingerbread cookies will last up to 3 weeks at cool room temperature in an airtight container.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nflexible spatula\n,\noffset spatula\n, pastry brush,\nrolling pin\n, embossed rolling pin (optional),\nrimmed baking sheet\nConstruction Gingerbread Recipe\nNotes\nFor soft and chewy gingerbread, roll the dough to a thickness of just 1/4 inch, but otherwise bake as directed. This will reduce the yield substantially, warranting at least a double batch.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nWith or without frosting, the gingerbread cookies will last up to three weeks at cool room temperature in an airtight container.\nCookies\nChristmas Cookies"
