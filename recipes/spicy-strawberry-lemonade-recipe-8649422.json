  "full_text": "Spicy Strawberry Lemonade\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nChilling Time\n2 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 40 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8\nMakes\n7 1/2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the Strawberry Lemonade Concentrate:\n3/4\npound\nstrawberries\n(\n12\nounces\n;\n340\ng\n), hulled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1\ncup\ngranulated\nsugar\n(\n7\nounces\n;\n200\ng\n)\n1 1/2\npounds\nlemons\n(\n5 to 6\nmedium\nlemons\n), zested and halved\n3 to 4\nounces\n(\n85-115\ng\n) medium-hot fresh red\nchiles\n, such as\nred finger chiles\n,\ncayenne peppers\n, or\nFresno peppers\n, stemmed and minced (see notes)\n12\nounces\ncold\nwater\n(\n1 1/2\ncups\n;\n350\nml\n)\nFor Serving:\n5\ncups\ncold still or sparkling\nwater\n, plus extra water as needed\nLemon\nslices\nfor garnish (optional)\nStrawberry\nslices\nfor garnish (optional)\nDirections\nFor the Strawberry Lemonade Concentrate:\nIn a large nonreactive mixing bowl, toss the strawberries with granulated sugar, lemon zest, and minced chiles. Refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until sugar has completely dissolved and chiles have infused into the syrup, about 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, juice the zested lemon halves (You should have about 1 cup of lemon juice). Refrigerate juice in an airtight container until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen strawberry mixture is ready, stir in 3/4 cup (180ml) reserved lemon juice and 1 1/2 cups (355ml) water and refrigerate for another 30 minutes. Strain through a nonreactive fine-mesh strainer or piece of cheesecloth into a glass or ceramic container (you should have about 2 1/2 cups concentrate total). Cover and refrigerate the concentrate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor Serving:\nPour strawberry lemonade concentrate into a large pitcher. Stir in 5 cups cold still or sparkling water and garnish with lemon slices and strawberry slices, if using. Dilute with additional water and remaining 1/4 cup lemon juice to taste, if needed (see notes).\u00a0 Serve over ice.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nSilicone spatula, cheesecloth or nonreactive fine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nHow much chile you use will depend heavily on your tolerance for heat and the type of chile you use. In our testing, about 3 to 4 ounces of medium-hot red finger chiles (about 4 to 6 chiles) produced a lemonade with a good, but not oppressive, heat. Depending on your taste and the specific chiles you use, you may want to use more or less for a hotter or milder effect. You can also use smaller red chiles such as Thai bird's eye, but keep in mind that you may need to use less of hotter chiles like those. If in doubt, start with less and taste the strawberry-chile syrup as it develops; you can always add more but cannot remove the chiles if they're too much.\nThe ratio of the strawberry lemonade concentrate to water is based on my personal taste preference to create my ideal balanced sweet and tart drink. Adjust with additional water and lemon juice to your own taste level, keeping in mind the lemonade will dilute further when served over ice.\nTo make one serving of finished strawberry lemonade, combine 1/2 cup strawberry lemonade concentrate with 1 cup of cold water, garnish, adjust with water and lemon juice to taste, and serve over ice.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe spicy strawberry-lemonade concentrate can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one week.\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nThe Latest\nStrawberry\nLemon\nChile Pepper"
