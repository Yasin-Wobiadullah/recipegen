  "full_text": "Concord Grape Jam\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n85 mins\nActive\nAbout 90 mins\nResting Time\n6 hrs 5 mins\nTotal\n7 hrs 40 mins\nServes\n48 servings\nMakes\n6 half-pint jars\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8\ncups\nconcord grapes\n6\ncups\ngranulated sugar\n1/2\nteaspoon\nunsalted butter\nJuice of\n1/2\na\nlemon\nDirections\nIf you are going to preserve the jam, prepare the jars and lids: place six half-pint jars on a rack in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the jars, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes, then turn off heat and allow jars to rest in the hot water. Meanwhile, put bands and lids in a small saucepan and cover with water. Heat over medium heat until the water is simmering, then remove pan from heat and allow the bands and lids to rest in hot water until ready to use.\nSeparate the grape skins from the pulp by squeezing the grapes between your fingers. Put the skins in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until they are coarsely chopped. Transfer them to a large heavy-bottomed pot and add 1/4 cup of water. Bring to a simmer and cook until the skins have softened a bit, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place the grape pulp in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the grapes lose their shape, about 10 minutes. Pour the grape pulp through a fine-mesh sieve or food mill into a large bowl. Force out as much pulp as you can and discard the seeds.\nAdd grape pulp to the pot with grape skins and stir to combine. Add sugar, butter, and lemon juice and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until jam has reduced and thickened and reached the gel stage, about 45 minutes. To test the jam, put a small plate in the freezer. When it is chilled, spoon a bit of jam onto the plate and return it to the freezer for one minute. Drag your fingertip through the jam and tilt the plate from side to side. If the jam stays put and doesn't run, it's set. If not, simmer the jam for a few minutes more.\nLadle hot jam into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe rims of jars, cover with lids, and screw bands on until just barely tight. Place jars on rack in pot and cover completely with water. Cover pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Turn off heat, uncover pot, and allow jars to rest in water for 5 minutes. Remove jars from pot and allow them to rest undisturbed on countertop for 6 hours or overnight.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot,\nfood processor\n,\nfine-mesh sieve\nor\nfood mill\n, 6 half-pint canning jars\nRead More\nFrom Jam to Jerky: Water Activity and the Science of Preservation\nJam Making 101: The Secrets to Getting Jam to Set Like a Pro\nA Beginner's Guide to Canning\nEasy Grape Jam Recipe\nConcord Grape-Thyme Bars Recipe\nConcord Grape Cake Recipe\nJams & Jellies\nGrape",
