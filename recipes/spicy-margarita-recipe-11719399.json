Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a cocktail shaker, muddle roughly 3 to 6 rounds of jalape\u00f1o until well crushed and juices have been expressed (how many slices of jalape\u00f1o you use will depend on the heat of your jalape\u00f1o and your personal spice preference; you can add more than 6 for an even hotter drink, if you like). Add tequila, Cointreau, and lime juice. Fill with ice and shake until thoroughly chilled, about 15 seconds (the bottom of a metal shaker should frost over).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFill glasses with fresh ice and strain margarita into both glasses. Garnish with lime wheels and any remaining jalape\u00f1o rounds and serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nThis recipe works best with a\nhigh-quality tequila\n. If you're using a\nbudget brand\nthat's a little harsh, swap the proportions for the Cointreau and lime juice and add 1/4 ounce simple syrup to each drink.\nSpecial Equipment\nCocktail shaker, muddler, cocktail strainer, rocks glasses\nCocktails\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nChile Pepper\nTequila"
