In a medium bowl, stir together sugar, salt, paprika, cayenne, Old Bay, and black pepper.\nIn a large bowl, lightly beat egg white until slightly foamy. Stir in spiced sugar until a smooth batter forms (it will start out looking dry but will loosen as you stir).\nFold in almonds until evenly coated. Spread glazed almonds in a single even layer on the prepared baking sheet and bake until nuts are lightly toasted, about 25 minutes.\nLet cool, stirring nuts every few minutes to prevent sticking. Once cool, break up any remaining clumps and serve. Nuts can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.\nNotes\nThis recipe will work just as well with other types of nuts, such as raw walnuts, cashews, and pecans.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Up Your Holiday With Three Spiced Nuts Variations\nQuick Snacks\nRoasting\nAlmonds\nChristmas Appetizers",
