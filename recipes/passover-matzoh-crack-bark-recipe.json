  "full_text": "Matzo Bark\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n35 mins\nServes\n20 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4 to 6\nsheets\nkosher for Passover matzo\n1\ncup\n(\n2\nsticks\n)\nkosher for Passover margarine\n1\ncup\n(\n7 1/2\nounces\n)\nbrown sugar\n, firmly packed\n12\nounces\nhigh quality\ndark\nor semi-sweet kosher for Passover\nchocolate\n1\nvanilla bean\n1/2\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Cut out 2 sheets of aluminum foil\u2014each should be approximately 20 inches in length. Place the sheets on top of each other and fold over several times on the long side to join the sheets of foil and form a seam (forming the seam is crucial, otherwise your pan will be improperly lined and the caramel syrup will end up seeping under the foil. Take the large aluminum sheet and line a 12- by 17-inch rimmed baking sheet.\nPlace matzo side-by-side in the pan as tightly as possible without overlapping. Use matzo pieces to fill any gaps at the bottom of the pan. Set aside. Chop chocolate so pieces are about the size of standard chocolate chips and set aside.\nSlice vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Set aside. In a medium saucepan melt margarine over medium heat stirring frequently with a spatula. Once margarine has melted, add brown sugar and vanilla, stirring to combine. Cook until mixture is an even dark brown color and has begun to bubble, about 5 minutes. Remove mixture from heat and pour over matzo using spatula to spread.\nBake matzo for 5-10 minutes or until margarine mixture begins to bubble and crackers begin to lightly brown. Remove from oven and sprinkle evenly with chocolate allowing the heat to melt the chocolate for a few moments. Spread chocolate evenly with the spatula so all of the matzo is completely covered. Add any chopped toppings, sprinkling evenly over the surface. Refrigerate until chocolate sets and hardens. Sprinkle with salt then break apart and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nAluminum foil, jelly roll pan\nCandy\nPassover\nBaking\nChocolate",
