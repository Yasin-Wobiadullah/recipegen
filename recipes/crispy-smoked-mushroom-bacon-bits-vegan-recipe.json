Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Add 2 tablespoons oil and brush with a pastry brush to coat evenly. Lay sliced mushrooms on sheet in a single layer (you may have to work in batches or on 2 trays). Season with salt and pepper. Flip slices and season with more salt and pepper. Transfer to oven and cook for 20 minutes. Turn mushroom slices carefully with a thin metal spatula. Return to oven and continue cooking until well-browned and crisp, about 20 minutes longer. (Mushrooms will quickly overcook, so monitor them carefully.) Remove from oven and transfer mushrooms to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nTransfer mushrooms to a bowl and toss with maple syrup, sugar, garlic powder, paprika, and remaining oil. Season to taste with more salt and pepper. Transfer mushrooms to the basket of a steamer insert and space evenly over bottom.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nIgnite wood chunk over a burner or with a torch. Transfer to a large pot. Add steamer insert and cover pot with a tight-fitting lid. Let mushrooms smoke for 10 minutes. Remove from pot. For crisper mushrooms, return to lined baking sheet and continue baking until sugars start to caramelize gently, about 5 minutes longer. Allow to cool completely before transferring to an air-tight container and storing at room temperature for up to 5 days.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nRecipes By Diet\nVegan Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Sides\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nOyster Mushroom"
