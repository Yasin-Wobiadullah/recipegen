Pound into a fine paste. Alternatively, combine onion, chile, half of cilantro, salt, and half of lime juice in a food processor or blender and process, scraping down sides as necessary, until smooth paste is formed.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSplit each avocado in half, discard pits, and spoon out flesh into the molcajete or mortar and pestle (if large enough), or combine with the onion-chile pur\u00e9e in a medium mixing bowl. Roughly mash with the pestle or a stiff whisk.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nStir in remaining cilantro leaves, then season with lime juice and salt to taste. Serve immediately with warm tortilla chips or as desired.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nMolcajete, mortar and pestle\n, or\nfood processor\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nGuacamole is best made right before serving. If you do need to hold it, it is best kept refrigerated in an airtight container with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the guacamole (this will reduce expose to air and slow down browning caused by oxidation).\nGuacamole\nMexican\nAvocado\nCinco de Mayo\nGame Day",
