  "full_text": "Mark Bittman's Rice Pudding in the Oven Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n110 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n115 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/3\ncup\nany\nwhite rice\n1/2\ncup\nsugar\nPinch\nsalt\n4\ncups\nmilk\nDirections\nHeat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Combine the rice, sugar, salt, and milk in a large gratin dish that holds at least 6 cups. Stir a couple of times and put it in the oven, uncovered. Bake for 30 minutes, then stir. Bake for 30 minutes longer, then stir again; at this point the rice might be swelling up and the milk should begin to develop a bubbly skin (if so, stir it back into the mixture).\nCook until the rice plumps and starts to become a more noticeable part of the mixture and the skin becomes more visible and darker, about 30 minutes more.\nNow the pudding is getting close to done, so check on it every 10 minutes, stirring each time (it should reach the right texture in 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the kind of rice you used).\nThe pudding will be done before you think it\u2019s done. The rice should be really swollen and the milk thickened considerably but still pretty fluid (it will thicken more as it cools). Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold.\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nBaking\nDairy Milk\nWhite Rice",
