Cover with cold water by 2 inches, season with salt, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until the chickpeas are tender but still hold their shape, about 1 hour. Discard bay leaf, carrot, onion, and celery. Drain and rinse under cold running water until chilled. Let drain in a colander set in the sink.\nMeanwhile, adjust rack to 4 to 5 inches below broiler and preheat broiler to high. Place chiles on a foil-lined broiler pan and broil, turning occasionally, until completely blackened on all surfaces, about 15 minutes total. Crimp foil to seal around the chiles and set aside for 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cook bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until completely crisp. Remove from heat and stir in shallots and garlic. Immediately transfer to a large bowl. Add olive oil and 2 tablespoons lime juice and whisk to combine.\nWhen chiles are cool enough to handle, peel using your fingers. Discard skin, stems, and seeds and slice flesh into thin strips.\nWhen beans are cooked and drained, add to bacon mixture. Add chile strips, cotija, scallions, and cilantro and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately with lime wedges, or for better results, store overnight in a covered container in the refrigerator. Salad will keep for up to three days.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nEasy Make-Ahead Chickpea Salad With Bacon, Roasted Chilies, and Cotija Cheese\nSalads\nRoasting\nChickpeas\nCheese\nBacon"
