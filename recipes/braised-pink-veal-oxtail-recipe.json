Brown oxtail, turning the pieces until you have browned all the surfaces. Add wine, and let it simmer for 20 to 30 seconds. Then add tomatoes, roughly chopped, in addition to water, salt, and pepper. Turn all ingredients to coat well. Bring to a steady simmer. Cover the pot with a lid slightly ajar, and cook for 2 to 3 hours, turning oxtail occasionally.\nThe dish is ready when oxtail is fork-tender and almost falling off the bone. Tip the pot and spoon off as much of the fat as you can. Serve immediately, with rice or pasta if desired.\nVeal\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nBeef Mains"
