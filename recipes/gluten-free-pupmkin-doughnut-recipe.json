Repeat with remaining batter. Allow doughnuts to cool completely.\nFor the Coating:\nIn a 9-inch square pan, stir together granulated sugar and ground cinnamon. One at a time, dredge the doughnuts in the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Shake off excess sugar. Store doughnuts, covered, on the counter for up to 3 days.\nSpecial Equipment\nDoughnut pan (see note)\nNotes\nIf you don't own a doughnut pan, use a muffin pan for this recipe. The result gives you muffin-doughnuts, which don't taste quite the same but are very good.\nDoughnuts\nGluten-free\nBaking\nPumpkin"
