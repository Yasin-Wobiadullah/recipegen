Pour the reserved sauce over the sliced tuna.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nGarnish with serrano, cilantro, and sesame seeds. Serve right away with cucumber, avocado, and tostadas.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\nA very sharp slicing knife\nNotes\nThis recipe is generally made with a dark, Japanese-style soy sauce. I used Kikkoman Soy Sauce. If you're sensitive to sodium, consider using low or less-sodium soy sauce. Be careful not to confuse reduced-sodium soy sauce with light (usukuchi) soy sauce, which has a different flavor profile.\nScallions may be substituted for the spring onions.\nMake sure to buy extremely fresh fish that is suitable for eating raw; flash-frozen fish is even safer, as the deep freezing process kills some potential parasites.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis recipe should be served immediately.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nThe Latest\nMexican\nTuna\nNo-Cook Seafood",
