Prepared crispy pork belly from different stores contains varying amounts of salt. Taste it before you proceed as you may find that you need less fish sauce than the amount called for in this recipe. When in doubt, it's best to add less fish sauce than you think prudent as you can always add more.\nRead More\nChinese Broccoli With Oyster Sauce and Fried Garlic\nStir-Fried Beef With Chinese Broccoli\nHakka-Style Stir-Fry with Pork and Squid\nThe Serious Eats Field Guide to Asian Greens\nChinese\nThai\nStir-Fry\nPork Belly\nBroccoli",
