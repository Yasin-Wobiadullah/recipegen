Add garlic and onion and saut\u00e9 until starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add oregano, chile powder, cocoa powder, cumin, and beer. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Continue to simmer until sauce has thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Set aside.\nFor the Peppers:\nMeanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add beef and cook, breaking it up into little bits, until cooked through. Add onion and jalape\u00f1os, stir to combine, and continue cooking until vegetables are slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add cumin, chile powder, rice, tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, sour cream, and both cheeses and mix well. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Continue cooking until cheese is melted and filling is creamy, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat.\nArrange peppers in an 8- by 8-inch baking dish standing upright like cups.\nGenerously mound filling inside peppers and ladle sauce all over. Cover with foil and bake, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour, removing foil during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Let peppers rest 10 minutes, then serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nsaucepan\n,\nlarge skillet\n, 8- by 8-inch baking dish, aluminum foil\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe filling can be prepared in advance, and the peppers may be stuffed ahead of time. The same is true of the sauce; however, store the two components separately in the refrigerator. Remove the peppers and sauce from the refrigerator about 45 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature.\nRead More\nGrilled Chorizo-Stuffed Poblano Peppers\nStuffed Roasted Poblano Peppers With Cashew-Chipotle Sauce\nTex-Mex Cheese Enchiladas With Red Chile Gravy\nChiles Rellenos (Mexican-Style Cheese-Stuffed Chiles)\nMexican\nRoasting\nGround Beef\nCheese\nWhite Rice"
