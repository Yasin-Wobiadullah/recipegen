Cut one eggplant in half lengthwise. Coat one half with 1 teaspoon oil, wrap tightly in foil, and roast until completely tender, about 1 hour (set remaining 1 1/2 eggplants aside). Once tender, scrape flesh from roasted eggplant and discard skin. Place flesh in a cup that just fits around the head of an immersion blender. Add garlic, lemon juice, and mustard. Carefully add remaining oil so that it floats on top of the eggplant. Place head of immersion blender against bottom of cup and turn it on. Slowly pull it out of the jar forming a thick, creamy emulsion as you go. Season to taste with salt and set eggplant mayonnaise aside.\nFor the Sauce\n: While the eggplant is roasting, heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, red pepper, and oregano and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and their juice. Crush tomatoes with a potato masher, a stiff whisk, or a hand blender. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thick and rich, about 45 minutes. Season to taste with salt.\nFor the Fried Eggplant\n: Slice remaining 1 1/2 eggplants thinly lengthwise into about 16 slices. Season with salt and allow to rest for 20 minutes. Blot firmly with paper towels to compress and remove excess moisture.\nCombine flour and water, adding more flour or water as necessary to achieve a mixture about the consistency of thick pancake batter. Season to taste with salt. Add breadcrumbs to a shallow pie plate. Bread the eggplant slices one at a time by dipping in flour mixture, wiping off excess against side of bowl, and transferring to the crumbs. Press the crumbs firmly onto the eggplant so they adhere.\nHeat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C) as measured on an instant-read thermometer. Fry eggplant slices in 2 to 3 batches, turning occasionally until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Transfer cooked slices to a large plate lined with paper towels and season with salt as soon as they emerge from the fryer.\nTo Assemble:\nSlice bread in half. Spread some eggplant mayo on bottom half of each sandwich and top with eggplant slices (use half of the slices divided evenly between the four sandwiches). Top with half of the tomato sauce, using a spoon to spread evenly. Top with more eggplant mayo. Add a second layer of fried eggplant and a second layer of tomato sauce. Finish with more eggplant mayo and close sandwiches. Serve hot.\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion blender\nNotes\nThis recipe makes more eggplant mayo than you need; See below for storage information.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nAny leftover mayo can be stored in a covered container in the fridge for up to 1 week. After a night in the refrigerator, the mayo may start to lose some body and take on a slightly greasy appearance.\u00a0Briefly re-blend before using for the creamiest consistency.\nRead More\nMexican Fried Eggplant Sandwich (Vegan Tortas and Pambazos)\nCrispy Fried Chickpea Cake and Slaw Sandwiches\nAll-American Eggplant Parmesan\nMelanzane alla Parmigiana (Italian-Style Eggplant Parmesan)\nEggplant\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nTomato Sauces\nSandwiches"
