Place tofu cubes on top in a single layer. Cover with another layer of paper towels and press gently to remove excess moisture. If using fresh bread instead of stale, cut into cubes and bake at 300\u00b0F until firm and lightly browned, about 20 minutes.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nWhen Vietnamese Sandwiches and Italian Bread Salads Combine: Banh Mi Panzanella\nSalads\nVietnamese\nStovetop Tofu\nTofu"
