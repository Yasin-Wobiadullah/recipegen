Make note of the filled saucier's weight at this stage so the reduction can be tracked on the scale; otherwise a digital thermometer will be required. Pur\u00e9e thick skinned or fibrous fruit with an immersion blender, or mash tender fruit with a fork or metal spatula until swimming in juice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPlace over medium heat and bring to a boil, continuously stirring and scraping along the bottom and sides of the saucier with a flexible, heat-resistant spatula. This should take no longer than 5 minutes; if it seems to be moving too slowly, simply increase the heat.\nOnce the mixture begins to boil, continue cooking until reduced by 4 ounces (mixture should be 220\u00b0F) for a thin, saucy ribbon or 5 ounces (224\u00b0F) for a thick, gooey ribbon. This phase should take about 6 minutes; while it's natural for the timing to vary from one stovetop to the next, a significant delay may indicate the heat is too low, or that there's a problem with the thermometer (such as shallow or unsteady placement of the probe; also very common if tilting the pot to get a reading). When in doubt, weight measurements will provide a more reliable indication of the reduction's progress.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStrain the syrup into a heat-safe container and stir in the orange blossom water (or other aromatics; see note). If desired, season with an additional pinch of salt, bearing in mind the syrup will seem less sweet when frozen. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Meanwhile, take note that most ice creams will benefit from an extra pinch of salt in the base to account for the added sweetness of a fruit swirl.\nStir the syrup until viscous, then transfer to a disposable piping bag or use a spoon to drizzle. Layer the thick syrup into a chilled container with freshly churned ice cream, using as much or as little as you like. Freeze the ice cream according to the recipe directions. Any remaining syrup can be used as a sauce, or combined with club soda for a fizzy drink.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n2-quart stainless steel saucier,\ndigital scale\nor\ninstant-read thermometer\n, disposable pastry bag (optional)\nNotes\nToasted sugar, lemon juice, and orange blossom water work with almost any fruit, but this recipe is highly adaptable.\nSyrup\nGluten-free Desserts\nStovetop Fruit\nFruit\nSpring Desserts",
