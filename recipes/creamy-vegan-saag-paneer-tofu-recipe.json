Press tofu firmly between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Cut into 1 1/2\u2013inch cubes and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together miso paste, 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice, lemon zest, and 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil. Season generously with salt and pepper. Add tofu and toss to coat. Spread tofu evenly over a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Place in oven and bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Sauce may darken a little against the foil; this is fine. Set tofu aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nMeanwhile, for the Cauliflower Pur\u00e9e:\nCombine nut milk and cauliflower in a small saucepan. Season with salt and bring to a simmer. Cook until cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes. Pur\u00e9e mixture using a hand blender or countertop blender. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nFor the Spinach:\nHeat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil in a large saucepan or saucier over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic, ginger, and chiles and cook, stirring, until fragrant and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add coriander, cumin, turmeric, and cardamom pod and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spinach and arugula or mustard greens one handful at a time, stirring and adding more as the greens wilt (see note).\nReduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until greens are fully wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in cauliflower pur\u00e9e and continue to cook until greens are very tender, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in tofu cubes and heat through. Stir in remaining lemon juice, season with salt, adjust consistency with a little water if necessary, and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nCountertop blender\nor\nimmersion blender\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nMature curly spinach works best for this dish, as it has a more robust flavor and more tender texture when braised. Flat-leaf spinach will do. Avoid baby spinach, which turns mushy when cooked. If you can't find mature fresh spinach, you can also use frozen spinach: Defrost and drain it well, then add it all at once in Step 3, rather than a handful at a time. If you prefer, you can use 100% spinach instead of a combination of spinach and arugula or mustard greens.\nRead More\nSarson Ka Saag\nPalak Paneer\nGrilled Naan\nSpinach\nIndian\nVegetarian Mains\nPaneer\nTofu"
