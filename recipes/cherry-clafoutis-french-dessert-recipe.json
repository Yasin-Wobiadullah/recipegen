In a medium mixing bowl, stir together flour, sugar, and salt. Whisk in milk, eggs, butter, kirsch (if using), and vanilla extract or seeds until a smooth batter forms.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nGrease a baking dish, tart pan, or cast iron skillet (about 9 inches in diameter) with butter. Scatter cherries all over bottom. Pour batter on top and bake until clafoutis is puffed and browned and a knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Let cool slightly, then slice and serve, sprinkling powdered sugar on top. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nPie plate\n,\ncast iron skillet,\nor tart pan (about 9 inches in diameter).\nNotes\nIf using a vanilla bean, reserve the scraped bean for another use (you can stick it in a container of sugar to create vanilla sugar, for instance).\nWe like pitted cherries because the clafoutis is easier to eat that way, but feel free to leave the cherries whole if you prefer; that's a more traditional way to do it, and some people like the subtle bitter almond flavor the pits add to the dessert.\nRead More\nSour Cherry Gin Cocktail\nCherry Ice Cream\nCherry Pit Whipped Cream\nClassic Biscuit-Topped Peach Cobbler\nPies\nFrench\nCherry\nEaster Desserts\nMother's Day"
