  "full_text": "Lablabi (Tunisian Chickpea Soup) From 'The Heart of the Plate'\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n90 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n90 mins\nServes\n5\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\n(\n1\npound\n)\ndried chickpeas\n, soaked for at least 4 hours or up to overnight\n8\ncups\nwater\n3\u20134\nlarge\ngarlic cloves\n, peeled and halved\n2\ntablespoons\nolive oil\n2\ncups\nminced onion\n(\n1\nlarge\n)\n2\nteaspoons\nground cumin\n1\ntablespoon\nminced\nor\ncrushed garlic\n1 1/2\nteaspoons\nsalt\n, or more to taste\n2\ntablespoons\nfresh lemon juice\nBlack pepper\nDirections\nDrain and rinse the soaked chickpeas, then transfer them to a soup pot, large saucepan, or Dutch oven, along with the water and garlic cloves. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, partially cover, and cook until the chickpeas are completely tender, 1 hour or longer. (You want to err on the soft side.)\nMeanwhile, place a medium skillet over medium heat for about a minute, then add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the onion and cumin, and cook, stirring, for 5 to 8 minutes, until the onion becomes soft. Add the minced garlic and 1 teaspoon of the salt, reduce the heat to low, and continue to cook for another 10 minutes. Cover and cook over the lowest possible heat for 10 minutes longer, then remove from the heat.\nWhen the chickpeas are very tender, add the onion-garlic mixture, scraping in as much as you can of whatever adhered to the pan. Collect the remaining parts (this is flavor!) by adding the lemon juice to the skillet and stirring it around, scraping the sides and bottom (deglazing), then pouring all of this onto the chickpeas as well. Taste to adjust the salt (you will likely want to add up to another 1/2 teaspoon) and grind in a generous amount of black pepper to taste. At this point, if you choose, you can puree some of the chickpeas with an immersion blender.\nCover and let the soup simmer for another 10 minutes or so before serving.\nOptional Enhancements:\nA few strands of saffron added to the cooking water in step 1\nA spoonful of harissa\nTouches of torn fresh flat-leaf parsley, cilantro, or mint\nCrushed red pepper\nA poached or fried egg added to each serving\nA drizzle of high-quality extra-virgin olive oil (or a citrus-spiked olive oil)\nCooked diced carrot mixed in\nA spoonful of thick yogurt on top\nA sprinkling of capers on top\nA spoonful or two of cooked brown basmati rice or couscous stirred in\nChopped, pitted olives on top\u2014or a bowl of assorted olives on the side\nCrisp, cold radishes on the side\u2014whole or sliced\nChopped or slivered Marcona almonds\nSliced ripe tomatoes on the side\nSoups\nNorth African\nVegan\nVegetarian\nChickpeas"
