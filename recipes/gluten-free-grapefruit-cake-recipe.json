Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly spray a -9 by 5-inch loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.\nIn medium bowl, whisk together white rice flour, sweet rice flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, and xanthan gum. In bowl of food processor, combine granulated sugar and grapefruit zest. Process until no large pieces of zest remain, about 30 seconds. Add eggs. Process until thoroughly combined. Add dry ingredients. Pulse until smooth, 10 to 12 short pulses. Add oil and Greek-style yogurt. Run processor until thick batter forms, about 15 seconds, scraping down sides as necessary.\nSpoon batter evenly into prepared loaf pan. Bake until golden brown. A cake tester inserted into center of loaf should come out clean or with just a few dry crumbs, about 40 minutes.\nWhile loaf bakes, prepare glaze. Combine grapefruit juice and granulated sugar in small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until mixture boils and sugar dissolves. Remove from heat.\nRemove loaf from oven. Allow to cool in pan for three minutes. Transfer loaf to wire rack set over a plate or pan. Using a long skewer, immediately poke holes all over loaf. (Skewer should reach bottom of loaf.) Brush 1/3 of glaze over top of loaf. Allow loaf to absorb glaze, about 5 minutes. Repeat two more times with remaining glaze. Cool loaf before serving. Wrap and store at room temperature for up to three days or freeze cooled loaf for up to one month.\nSpecial equipment\n9- by 5-inch loaf pan\nQuick Breads\nGluten-free Breakfast & Brunch"
