Reduce the heat so that water is steaming but no longer boiling. (If you have a thermometer, make sure the water registers somewhere between 160 \u030a and 180 \u030aF). Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, just until the flesh turns opaque, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large plate and set aside\nMicrowave corn on high heat for 4 minutes. Remove husks, then slice the kernels off the cobs with a sharp, thin-bladed knife. Place the corn kernels in a large mixing bowl.\nPlace the garlic, peanuts, chili(es), and dried shrimp (if using) in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag. Squeeze air out and seal the bag, then crush everything with a hard object, such as a sturdy mason jar, a meat pounder, or a rolling pin. The peanuts and chili(es) should be finely crushed and the dried shrimp flattened and flaky.\nAdd tomatoes and green beans to the peanut bag; seal the bag. With your hands, lightly squeeze the contents of the bag until the tomatoes are somewhat bruised (and release some juice) and the green beans a bit softened. Add the contents of the bag to the corn kernels in the mixing bowl along with the carrots and poached shrimp.\nZest one lime and add the zest to the mixing bowl. Juice the zested lime and add the juice to the mixing bowl as well.\nAdd the sugar and fish sauce to the mixing bowl. Toss the salad and adjust the taste to your liking with additional lime juice, fish sauce, or sugar. Serve immediately or cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and keep it refrigerated for no more than one hour before serving.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSerious Entertaining: A Summer Thai Feast\nCorn\nThai\nShrimp\nQuick Salads",
