Finely chop lemon zest. Add lemon juice and half of zest to bowl with watermelon. Add mint, oil, and arugula (if using) and toss until watermelon is evenly dressed. Season lightly to taste with salt and pepper. (The cheese will add saltiness, so go light on the salt at this stage.)\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nTransfer salad to a wide, shallow bowl or a large plate and spread out evenly. Crumble feta over top. Sprinkle with remaining lemon zest. Drizzle with more olive oil and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Liz Voltz\nSpecial Equipment\nSharp\nvegetable peeler\nNotes\nThis dish greatly depends on the quality of the feta. If you have options at your supermarket, look for true Greek or Bulgarian sheep's milk feta, which tends to be creamier and tangier than domestic cow's-milk versions.\nTo make this salad more substantial, add arugula.\nRead More\nTomato-Watermelon Salad Recipe\nWatermelon, Lychee, Feta, and Basil Salad With Spicy Lemongrass Vinaigrette Recipe\nSpicy Grilled Watermelon Recipe\nGrilled Corn, Tomato, Feta, and Herb Salad Recipe\nHalloumi and Watermelon Salad\nMemorial Day\nNo-Cook Salads\nFeta Cheese\nWatermelon\nMint"
