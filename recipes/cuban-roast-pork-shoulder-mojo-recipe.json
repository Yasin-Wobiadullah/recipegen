Season to taste generously with salt. Transfer half of mojo to a sealed container and reserve in refrigerator. Add pork to remaining mojo and turn to coat. If desired, transfer pork and marinade to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and refrigerate 2 hours or up to overnight before continuing.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nFor the Pork and to Finish:\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place pork and juices on top and fold up foil, crimping to seal loosely but making sure that there is room for air to circulate inside. Place in oven and roast for 3 hours. Fold back foil, increase oven temperature to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C), and continue roasting, basting pork with pan juices occasionally, until pork shows almost no resistance when a metal skewer or knife is inserted into it and the surface is crackly and brown, 2 to 3 hours longer. Remove pork from oven and let rest 10 to 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nPour accumulated pork juices into a bowl and discard all except 1 cup. Add reserved mojo to pork drippings, along with fresh chopped mint and oregano. Whisk together and season to taste with salt.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nServe shredded pork, passing mint mojo and lime wedges on the side. Serve rice, beans, and plantains on the side. Reserve any leftovers for sandwiches.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nSpecial Equipment\nGallon-sized zipper-lock bag, aluminum foil,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nwhisk\nNotes\nIf you can find sour Seville oranges (naranjas \u00e1grias), use their juice in place of both the orange and the lime juice.\nRead More\nUltra-Crispy Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder Recipe\nThai-Inspired Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder Feast Recipe\nGarlic- and Herb-Roasted Pork Loin With Crackling and Spiced Apple Chutney Recipe\nPork Shoulder Demystified: Boston Butt Versus Picnic Shoulder\nCrispy Pork Shoulder Hash With Charred Asparagus and Serrano Chile Recipe\nCuban\nRoasted Pork\nPork Shoulder\nPork Mains",
