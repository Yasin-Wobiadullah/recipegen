In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and lemon zest and set aside. Remove the berries from the freezer and toss them with the sugar mixture to coat them completely. Pour berry mixture into the shaped, chilled pie shell. Cover with the rolled, chilled top crust; trim dough to a 1/2 to 3/4-inch overhang. Fold edges under and crimp as desired to seal. Chill the pie for 20 minutes.\nAfter 20 minutes, remove from the fridge and place on a rimmed baking sheet; brush the top with egg wash, sprinkle with sugar if using, and cut a few slits in the top with a sharp knife. Bake the pie centered on the lowest rack of the preheated oven for 20 minutes, rotating halfway through.\nDrop the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00baF), and continue baking until the top is golden brown, the bottom is cooked through, and the filling is bubbling up through the slits, about 1 hour 25 minutes; loosely cover edges (and eventually the entire pie) with aluminum foil as needed to prevent excess browning. Let pie cool on a wire rack until filling is set before serving, 2 to 3 hours.\nSpecial equipment\n9-inch pie plate, whisk, pastry brush, rimmed baking sheet\nThis Recipe Appears In\nUse Frozen Berries for a Mixed Berry Pie in Winter\nPies\nFruit\nDesserts\nBaked Fruit"
