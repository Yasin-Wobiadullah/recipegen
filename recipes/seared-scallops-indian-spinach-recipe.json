Add cumin seeds and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until they start to change color, about 15 seconds. Add red onion, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion starts to brown, about 7 minutes. Stir in the cayenne, 2 teaspoons garam masala, turmeric, and salt, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nAdd a handful of spinach leaves and stir until wilted and bright green. Continue adding a handful at a time until all the spinach has been added. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until spinach releases its liquid to form a sauce, 5 to 8 minutes.\nMeanwhile, dry the scallops on paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper. Heat remaining two tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When shimmering, add the scallops and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about three minutes. Flip each and cook until brown on the other sides, about 2 minutes. When done, set scallops aside on a plate.\nTurn off the heat for the spinach, and stir in the remaining teaspoon of garam masala and then heavy cream. Divide spinach mixture between four plates. Top each with 3 scallops. Serve immediately.\nScallops\nStovetop Seafood\nSpinach\nQuick Dinners",
