Dough temperature should reach 60\u00b0F (15.5\u00b0C) before stretching and baking; exact timing will depend upon ambient temperature.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Rivard\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, combine 4 teaspoons parsley, biber sal\u00e7asi, tomato paste,\u00a0 garlic, allspice, paprika, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir with spatula until smooth paste forms. Add lamb and knead gently with hands until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed; mixture can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Rivard\nUsing a countertop or immersion blender, process tomatoes until a coarse but evenly blended sauce forms, about 10 seconds. Transfer to a 2-cup liquid measuring cup; if needed, add reserved tomato liquid to yield 2 cups (475ml) sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Rivard\nPreheat pizza oven to 800\u00b0F (425\u00b0C). When ready to bake, coat one dough ball generously on both sides with flour and place on well-floured surface, seam side down. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer 1-inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough into a 10- or 12-inch circle (final dimension depends upon the size of your oven) about 1/4-inch thick by draping over knuckles and gently stretching. Transfer to floured wooden or perforated metal pizza peel.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Rivard\nWorking quickly, spread an even layer of tomato sauce over pizza, leaving outer 1/2-inch rim untopped. Spread string cheese evenly over sauce, then dollop meat mixture over pizza in small chunks. Drizzle with olive oil.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Rivard\nTransfer pizza to oven and bake, rotating pie regularly with a metal peel for even cooking, until rim is lightly charred and bottom is crisp, 90 to 180 seconds total. Retrieve pizza with a metal peel and transfer to a cutting board. Sprinkle with parsley and sumac, slice, and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Melissa Rivard\nRepeat steps 5 through 7 for remaining pizzas.\nSpecial Equipment\nHigh-temperature outdoor pizza oven\n,\nwooden or perforated metal pizza peel\n, metal pizza peel.\nNotes\nBiber sal\u00e7asi can be found in Middle Eastern grocery stores or online. If unavailable, increase tomato paste to 3 tablespoons, paprika to 4 teaspoons, and add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne.\nIf Armenian string cheese is unavailable, substitute 8 ounces (225g) low-moisture mozzarella, shredded, tossed with 1/4 teaspoon nigella seeds (if available).\nGround sumac can also be found at Middle Eastern markets or online.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nLamb sausage mixture can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 24 hours.\nPizza\nItalian\nCheese\nSavory\nGround Lamb"
