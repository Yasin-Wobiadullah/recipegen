Meanwhile, cut greens from turnip bulbs, leaving a small portion of stem (less than 1/2 inch) attached to each bulb. Wash leafy greens and turnips well of any sand. Peel turnips.

Using tongs or a spider, transfer greens to cold water to chill, then drain, squeeze out excess water, and chop into small pieces.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nHeat oil in a cast iron, carbon steel, or stainless steel skillet over high heat, just until the first wisps of smoke appear.
