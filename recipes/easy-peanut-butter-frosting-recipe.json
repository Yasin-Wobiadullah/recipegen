Mix on medium speed until creamy and pale, about 3 minutes, then reduce speed to low and sprinkle in powdered sugar, a little at a time. After the last addition, increase speed to medium and continue beating until creamy and light, about 3 minutes. Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then continue beating a minute more. If you like, adjust to taste with more vanilla or salt. Use immediately. Frosted desserts will keep up to 1 week at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\nwith paddle attachment\nNotes\nThis frosting tastes great when made with natural or fresh-ground peanut butter, but it may have a somewhat curdled appearance compared to frosting made from commercially homogenized peanut butter.\nWhile honey's a natural match for peanut butter, don't hesitate to try maple syrup or molasses instead; any sticky syrup will do\u2014even\nhomemade caramel\n, if you happen to have a batch on hand.\nOrganic powdered sugars are typically made with tapioca starch instead of cornstarch, which gives them a smoother texture. Any powdered sugar made with tapioca starch will work in this recipe. Regular powdered sugar will work, too, but will produce a slightly grittier frosting.\nRead More\nTaste Test: Creamy Peanut Butters\nChocolate Peanut Butter Cupcakes\nPeanut Butter Pot de Cr\u00e8me with Red Wine Suicide\nBlack Bottom Peanut Butter Mousse Pie\nSoft and Crunchy Peanut Butter Cookies\nDesserts\nGluten-free Desserts\nNo-Cook Desserts\nPeanut Butter",
