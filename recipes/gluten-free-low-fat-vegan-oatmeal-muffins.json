Add oats. Reduce heat to low and cover. Cook until oatmeal is thick and tender, about ten minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.\nAdjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Line 16 muffin cups with paper liners or grease with non-stick cooking spay. In medium bowl, whisk together brown rice flour, dark brown sugar, sorghum flour, ground flax meal, tapioca starch, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg. Add cooked oatmeal, dairy-free milk, applesauce, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until batter forms. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, about 2/3 full. Bake until golden brown. A cake tester inserted into the center of a muffin should come out clean, about 20 minutes.\nAllow muffins to cool in pan for three minutes. Turn muffins out onto a wire rack to finish cooling. Store muffins on the counter, covered, for up to three days. Cooled muffins freeze well for up to six weeks.\nSpecial equipment\nmuffin pan\nBreakfast & Brunch\nGluten-free Breakfast & Brunch\nVegan Breakfast & Brunch\nMuffins",
