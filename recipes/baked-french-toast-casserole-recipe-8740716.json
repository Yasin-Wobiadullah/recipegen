Set a wire rack inside two 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheets. Arrange bread slices in a single layer on racks and bake until bread is dried out, about 20 minutes, flipping bread and rotating baking sheets halfway through. Let cool 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nMeanwhile, butter a 9- by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, vanilla, salt, nutmeg (if using), 1/2 cup of the sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cinnamon to thoroughly combine. Add milk and whisk to blend. Working with 2 or 3 toasted bread slices at a time, soak bread slices in egg mixture, flipping once, just until the bread absorbs the liquid but remains intact, 1 to 2 minutes, then arrange bread in prepared baking dish, overlapping slices. Pour any remaining egg mixture over bread slices. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until bread is saturated, at least 1 1/2 hours or up to 12 hours.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00baC). Let casserole sit at room temperature while oven preheats; remove plastic wrap. Bake in preheated oven until browned and set, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and preheat broiler.\u00a0Stir together remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl. Using a pastry brush, evenly brush bread with melted butter, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Broil until bread is crisp and browned in spots, about 4 minutes. Serve warm with maple syrup, chopped nuts, powdered sugar, and fresh berries, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\n2 wire racks, 2 rimmed baking sheets, 9- by 13-inch baking dish, pastry brush\nNotes\n1/3 cup plus 1 1/2 teaspoons light or dark brown sugar can be used in place of the granulated sugar in both the casserole and the cinnamon-sugar topping.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe casserole can be made up to 12 hours in advance.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nThe Latest\nFrench Toast",
