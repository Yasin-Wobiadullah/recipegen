Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large pot of salted boiling water, cook fregola until al dente, according to package timing. Drain, then transfer to a large mixing bowl.\nAdd squash to fregola. Toss with 1/4 cup olive oil, scallions, mint, parsley, and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.\nServe squash and fregola salad with roasted chicken and jus; drizzle fregola with more oil as needed before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nFregola is a toasted Sardinian pasta similar in shape and size to Israeli couscous. If you can't find fregola, you can substitute an equal amount of Israeli couscous or orzo pasta; you can even lightly toast the dried pasta first on a baking sheet in a 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) oven for a few minutes (until some of the pieces are lightly browned) to simulate the taste of fregola.\nRead More\nPan-Roasted Chicken With Vegetables and Dijon Jus Recipe\nGarlic-Roasted Chicken with Carrots and Parsnips Recipe\nPan-Seared Chicken Thighs With Butternut Squash and Carrots Recipe\nChicken in a Pot (Poule au Pot) With Potatoes and Squash Recipe\nChicken\nQuick Dinners\nButternut Squash\nWhole Chicken\nWinter",
