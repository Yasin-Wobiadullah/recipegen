Add the tea bag to the water and return to a boil. Cook the rice in the tea water according to package directions (it will take approximately 10 minutes).\nWhile the rice cooks, cook the fish. Season the salmon with salt on both sides. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place the fish, presentation side down, in the skillet, and sear until golden and crispy, about 6 minutes. Using tongs or a fish spatula, carefully flip the fish over and cook on second side until barely cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\nWhisk the rice vinegar, water, sugar, mayonnaise, wasabi paste, and a pinch of salt together in a bowl. Add the warm edamame, and stir to combine. Divide rice between two plates. Top with fish and edamame and sprinkle with wasabi peas.\nSeafood Mains\nStovetop Seafood\nRice & Grains\nSalmon\nQuick Dinners"
