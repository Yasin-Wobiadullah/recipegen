Juice up one lime and add the lime juice to the tuna bowl along with one tablespoon of fish sauce. Mix everything together and adjust seasoning as necessary with more lime juice and fish sauce. (If you use salted roasted peanuts, you may want to go easy on the fish sauce; you can always add more.)\nAdd peanuts to the tuna mixture; toss everything together lightly.
