Cover with a heat-proof plate and microwave on high until carrots are tender, about 3 minutes. Using a colander or fine-mesh sieve, drain carrots. Refrigerate, uncovered, until cool, about 10 minutes.\nIn a blender, combine eggs, carrot juice, flour, butter, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and carrots. Blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl or measuring cup.\nHeat a 10-inch nonstick skillet or cr\u00eape pan over medium. Brush with a thin layer of butter, and reduce heat to medium-low. Add about 1/4 cup cr\u00eape batter, swirling and tilting pan immediately to spread batter into a thin, even layer.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nCook until edges of cr\u00eape start to brown, 30 to 45 seconds. Using a long spatula, flip cr\u00eape and cook until a few brown spots appear on the bottom, 10 to 15 seconds. Transfer to a baking sheet. Fold cr\u00eape into quarters by folding it in half, then folding in half again. Repeat process with remaining batter, wiping skillet clean and lightly buttering skillet as needed.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nFor the Orange Sauce:\nIn a large stainless steel skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add orange zest and juice, sugar, and cinnamon stick, stirring to combine. Bring to a simmer, and cook until slightly thickened and reduced by about 1/3, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nWorking with 1 cr\u00eape at a time, use tongs to gently dip both sides of folded cr\u00eape into sauce, then release into the sauce. Repeat with remaining cr\u00eapes.\nAdd orange liqueur and cognac, and using a long-handled lighter, carefully ignite sauce, and cook over low heat, shaking the pan, until flames have died out and sauce thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Discard cinnamon stick. Spoon sauce over cr\u00eapes and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nMicrowave, colander or fine-mesh sieve, blender, nonstick skillet or cr\u00eape pan, long-handled lighter\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe cr\u00eape batter can be made up to 24 hours ahead of time. Cooked cr\u00eapes can be stacked with parchment paper between each layer, tightly wrapped with plastic wrap, and refrigerated for up to 3 days.\nOnce sauced, the cr\u00eapes should be eaten immediately.\nCarrots\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nDesserts",
