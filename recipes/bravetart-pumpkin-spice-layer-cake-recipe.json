Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Lightly grease two 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and line with parchment (explanation and tutorial\nhere\n).\nFor the Cake:\nCombine butter, sugar, baking powder, potato flour, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and cream until the mixture is fluffy, light, and soft, about 8 minutes, pausing to scrape bowl and beater halfway through. With mixer running, add egg yolks one at a time, followed by vanilla. Take care not to overbeat at this stage.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, combine milk and pumpkin pur\u00e9e and whisk until smooth. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in a third of the cake flour, followed by a third of the pumpkin/milk mixture. Alternate between the two, allowing each addition to roughly incorporate before adding the next. Once batter is smooth, fold with a flexible spatula to ensure it\u2019s well mixed from the bottom up. Divide between prepared cake pans, adding just about 27 ounces (756g) to each one.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake until cakes are well risen and firm to the touch, about 35 minutes or to 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). A toothpick inserted into the center will have a few crumbs still attached. Cool until no trace of warmth remains, about 2 hours due to the cakes' thickness. Run a butter knife around edges to loosen, then invert cakes onto a wire rack, peel off parchment, and return cakes right side up. (Covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours.)\nFor the Crumb Coat:\nLevel cakes with a serrated knife (full directions\nhere\n) and set scraps aside for snacking. (These can also be crumbled into a batch of freshly churned\nbuttermilk ice cream\n.) Place 1 layer on a heavy cast iron turntable; if you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with second layer, then cover sides of cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (watch our\ncrumb-coating tutorial\nfor more info). Refrigerate cake until buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes.\nRe-whip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency, then use to decorate chilled cake as desired; finish with a sprinkling of cinnamon and toasted pecans, if desired. Let cake return to cool room temperature before serving. Cut with a chef\u2019s knife to serve and cover exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep cake moist. Under a cake dome, the cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nflexible spatula\n, two\n8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans\n(preferably 3 inches deep),\nserrated knife\n,\noffset spatula\n,\ncast iron turntable\n,\nwire rack\nNotes\nPotato flour is made from whole potatoes rather than their isolated starch, so the two can't be used interchangeably; make sure to grab the right one! Potato flour is readily found in supermarkets like Kroger and Whole Foods, from brands like Bob's Red Mill, or it can be purchased online. It truly makes a difference in the cake's tenderness and loft.\nRead More\nA Guide to Cake Frosting\nThe World of Buttercreams: 6 Varieties to Try at Home\nHow to Level a Layer Cake (No Toothpicks Required)\nHow to Crumb-Coat a Layer Cake\nPumpkin Skillet Coffee Cake With Streusel Topping Recipe\nPumpkin Streusel Muffins Recipe\nQuick and Easy Pumpkin Spice Cake\nCakes\nLayer Cake\nPumpkin\nThanksgiving Desserts\nChristmas Desserts"
