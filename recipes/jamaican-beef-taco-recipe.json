Season with salt and refrigerate until ready to use.\nFor the Beef Filling:\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add scallions, yellow onion, garlic, and Scotch bonnet pepper or hot sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add paprika, allspice, Jamaican curry powder, and dried thyme, and stir to combine.\nAdd ground beef, breaking up any large chunks as you stir. When the beef is just beginning to brown, pour in just enough water to cover the meat and add salt, pepper, and sugar.\nBring the beef to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Simmer until mixture is saucy and the meat is fully cooked through, 25\u201330 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nMeanwhile, for the Tortillas:\nIn a small bowl, combine oil, turmeric, and Jamaican curry powder. Stir well. Working on a baking sheet, brush oil onto both sides of each tortilla. (Turmeric can stain skin and plastic, so wear latex gloves and avoid drips and spills on surfaces that can stain.)\nWorking one at a time, cook tortillas in a skillet over moderate heat until oil is absorbed and tortillas are slightly crisp but still pliable, about 2 minutes per side; turmeric won't stain once fully cooked into tortillas. Transfer tortillas to a baking sheet and cover with a clean dish towel to keep warm.\nFill tortillas with spiced beef and top with pineapple-mango slaw. Serve warm.\nSpecial equipment\nlatex gloves\nNotes\nScotch bonnets are very hot peppers, so it's best to wear gloves when handling. Additionally, if you're worried about the heat level, start off with a small amount of Scotch bonnet pepper or hot sauce and add more only if you're able to take extra heat.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMeet the Jamaican Beef Pa-Taco: A Beef Patty-Inspired Taco\nBeef Mains\nJamaican\nStovetop Beef\nGround Beef\nTacos",
