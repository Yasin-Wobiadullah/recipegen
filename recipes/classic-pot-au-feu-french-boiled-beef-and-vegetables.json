Top with enough cold water to just cover and season with a very generous pinch of salt.\nBring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain a very gentle simmer. Cook, skimming occasionally, until each cut of beef is fork-tender, at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours, depending on the cut and animal your beef is from. If any piece of beef reaches tenderness before the others, simply transfer it to a large heatproof bowl, ladle a small amount of broth on top, and cover with plastic. Top up the pot with water as needed to keep all the ingredients covered.\nWhen all the beef is done, strain the broth, discarding thyme, onion, celery, garlic, and peppercorns, and bay leaf. Return all the cuts of beef and broth to the pot.\nAdd potatoes, leeks, carrots, cabbage, turnip, parsnip, and marrow bones, if using, to stockpot, making sure all are submerged in the broth with the beef. Return to a gentle simmer and cook until all the vegetables are very tender and marrows bones are fully warmed through to the center, about 30 minutes.\nSkim any fat from the broth. Transfer meats and vegetables to a platter, bathing with broth to keep moist. Season broth with salt. Serve broth as a soup, and the meats and vegetables as the main course; the marrow bones can be served with toasts (spread the marrow on the toasts and season with salt). Pass more salt at the table for seasoning the meats, along with mustard, grated horseradish, and cornichons.\nSpecial Equipment\nStockpot\nor\nDutch oven\nThis Recipe Appears In\nPot-au-Feu: The Dish That Made Boiled Beef a French Classic\nFrench\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nStovetop Beef\nBeef Chuck\nOxtail"
