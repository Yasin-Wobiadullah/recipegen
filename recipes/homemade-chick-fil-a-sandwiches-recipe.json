Place chicken breasts in a zipper-lock bag and add brine. Transfer to refrigerator and let sit no longer than 6 hours.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nMeanwhile, combine black pepper, paprika, MSG (if using), and cayenne in a small bowl. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nWhisk together milk and eggs in a medium bowl. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nCombine flour, non-fat milk powder, baking powder, remaining 1/2 teaspoon (3g) kosher salt, remaining 2 teaspoons (8g) sugar, and 2 tablespoons of spice mixture in a large bowl and whisk until homogenous. Drizzle 3 tablespoons (45ml) milk-egg mixture into flour mixture and rub with fingertips until the flour mixture is coarse like wet sand.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nIn a large wok, deep fryer, or Dutch oven, preheat oil to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\nRemove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Season on all sides with remaining spice mixture. Transfer to milk mixture and turn to coat. Working one cutlet at a time, allow excess milk mixture to drip off then transfer to flour mixture. Turn to coat, pile extra mixture on top of cutlet, and press down firmly to adhere as much mixture as possible to the meat. Lift cutlet, shake off excess flour, then slowly lower into hot oil. Repeat with remaining breasts.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nCook, turning breasts occasionally until golden brown and crisp on all sides, and chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nPlace 2 pickles on each bottom bun and a fried chicken cutlet on top. Close sandwiches, then cover with an overturned bowl or aluminum foil and allow to rest for 2 minutes to steam buns. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nSpecial Equipment\nDeep fryer,\nwok\n, or\nDutch oven\nNotes\nJust like the real thing, this fried chicken is quite salty. If you would like a less salty sandwich, reduce brining time to 1 hour and decrease salt in breading. I use Diamond Crystal kosher salt. If you are using Morton kosher salt, reduce the volume by 25%. If using regular table salt, reduce the volume 50%. (If measuring by weight, keep the amounts the same.)\nFried Chicken\nAmerican\nChicken Breast\nChicken Mains\nSandwiches"
