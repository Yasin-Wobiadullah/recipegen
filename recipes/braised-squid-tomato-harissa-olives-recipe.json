Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes.\nAdd wine and squid, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until alcohol smell has mostly cooked off, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, thyme sprigs, and olives and return to a simmer. Lower heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until squid is tender, about 30 minutes. Discard thyme.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStir in harissa and lemon zest, season with salt and pepper, sprinkle parsley on top, and serve.\nNotes\nIf you choose not to make harissa, you can find store-bought alternatives at well-stocked markets and gourmet stores.\nThis squid would be excellent served alongside pastas like couscous and fregola, or grains like rice and farro. (Fregola is pictured here.)\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe squid can be braised up to 4 days in advance and kept refrigerated in a sealed container; thin slightly with water and reheat before serving.\nRead More\nSquid Masala\nFried Calamari With Red Sauce\nHakka-Style Stir-Fry with Pork and Squid\nTaiwanese Deep-Fried Squid Balls\nSeafood Mains\nBraised & Stewed Seafood\nSquid",
