Slice half the lemon into thin slices and lay them inside the cavities of the fish, along with the rosemary, thyme, or other herbs.\nHeat the oil in a large, oven-proof skillet or roasting pan large enough to hold the fish over medium heat until almost smoking (or use multiple skillets), ensure that the entire surface of the skillet is coated in oil to avoid sticking. Lay the fish carefully in to the skillet, and cook for a minute. Spoon some of the oil over to top of the fish to coat it, then transfer the pan(s) to the oven.\nRoast the fish for about ten minutes, until just cooked through. If desired, finish by broiler to crisp the top of the skin.\nRemove from the oven and add the butter and parsley to the pan. As it sizzles and turns golden, spoon it constantly over the fish to infuse with flavor. Sprinkle the parsley into the butter for the last few moments of cooking.\nServe the fish immediately with the second half of the lemon cut into wedges for juicing over the fish.\nRoasted Seafood",
