Stir vigorously to mix the chocolate in and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-ounce tall glass, straw, long handled spoon\nNotes\nI belong to the traditionalist camp that says\nFox's U-Bet syrup\nor bust. But if you must use a different chocolate syrup, well, don't say I didn't warn you.\nI find that low-fat milks make the drink a bit watery for my taste, so I use whole milk here.\nIf you have a seltzer dispenser you'll get a nicer, foamier head, but you can still make this drink pouring bottled seltzer off a spoon and stirring vigorously.\nRead More\nRequiem for an Egg Cream: In Search of a New York Classic\nWe Tested 7 Soda Machines\u2014Here Are Our Favorites\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks",
