Mix on low to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. Pause to scrape the bowl with a flexible spatula, then beat a minute more. In chilly winter months, this process may take longer (see our\nguide to winter baking\nfor more info).\nWith the mixer running, crack in the egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix until dough begins to gather around the paddle but the flour hasn't quite disappeared. Fold once or twice with a flexible spatula to ensure the dough is well combined. Divide in half and proceed to the next step, or wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 1 week. Refrigerated dough should be left to stand at room temperature until soft and pliable, then lightly kneaded to restore its plasticity before rolling.\nWhen ready to bake, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). On a generously floured surface, roll a portion of the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch; check with a ruler to make sure your dough isn't too thin, or else the finished cookies will be more inclined to break. Slide an offset spatula underneath the dough to loosen. Cut with assorted cookie cutters and transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, leaving at least an inch of space in between cookies. Knead scraps together, then roll and cut as before. Repeat with remaining dough.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer to oven to bake. For soft cookies, bake until puffed and firm but perfectly pale, about 12 minutes. For crisp cookies, continue baking until pale gold around the very edges, about 3 minutes more. Let the cookies cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet, about 30 minutes. The true flavor and texture of the cookies will take another 30 minutes to develop. If you like, finish with a dusting of powdered sugar, or decorate with my favorite not-too-sweet\nroyal icing\n(full decorating tutorial\nhere\n). Store in an airtight container up to 1 week at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\nwith paddle attachment,\nrolling pin\n,\noffset spatula\n, assorted cookie cutters, ruler, flexible spatula,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nThe exact yield of this recipe varies considerably, depending on the sizes and shapes of your cookie cutters. The estimates below are based on assorted shapes with an average diameter of three inches\u2014larger holiday shapes, like snowflakes, hearts, and stars. The yield will nearly double if you use small, geometric shapes.\nCookies\nChristmas Cookies"
