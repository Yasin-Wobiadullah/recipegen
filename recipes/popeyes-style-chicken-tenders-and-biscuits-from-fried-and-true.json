Working in batches, remove 4 or 5 tenders at a time from the buttermilk marinade and toss in the breading, coating well. Transfer to a baking sheet and let rest until the breading adheres, 15 to 20 minutes.\nFry the chicken:\nWhile the chicken rests, add 2 inches of oil to a large (at least 6-quart) pot and heat to 300\u00b0F. Working in batches, fry 4 to 5 tenders at a time until brown and crisp, 5 minutes per batch. Remove to a paper towel to drain. Once all the chicken is fried, season lightly with salt and serve with the biscuits.\nNOTE:\nDufresne found the flavor combination in McCormick's Italian Herb Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning Mix (available in most grocery stores and online) to be the most pleasing for its blend of traditional chicken breading spices. If you can't find it, grind 2 teaspoons each sugar, salt. and dehydrated onions with one teaspoon each dried basil and oregano and 1/2 teaspoon each chile flakes, black pepper, and garlic powder.\nSpecial equipment\nCandy or deep-fry thermometer\nFried Chicken\nChicken Breast\nChicken Mains"
