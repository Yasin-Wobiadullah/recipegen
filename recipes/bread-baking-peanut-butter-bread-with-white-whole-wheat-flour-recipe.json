  "full_text": "Peanut Butter Bread with White Whole Wheat Recipe | Bread Baking\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nRising and Cooling Time\n2 hrs\nTotal\n3 hrs 10 mins\nServes\n10 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nlukewarm\nwater\n2 1/2\nteaspoons\nyeast\n1\ntablespoon\nbrown sugar\n1\ncup\n(\n4 1/2\nounces\n)\nwhite whole wheat flour\n1\ncup\n(\n4 1/2\nounces\n)\nbread flour\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n1/2\ncup\ncreamy peanut butter\nDirections\nMix the water, sugar, and yeast, and set aside until it's foamy, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, put the flours, salt, and peanut butter into the bowl of your food processor fitted with the dough blade (or whatever is recommended by the manufacturer). Pulse the processor a few times to distribute the salt and incorporate the peanut butter into the flour.\nSprinkle some cornmeal on the bottom of an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan, and/or spray it with baking spray for added insurance.\nWhen the yeast mixture is foamy, stir it again. Then, with the food processor running, pour the yeast mixture into the food processor as fast as the dough will absorb it. Continue processing until the dough forms a ball and cleans the sides of the food processor bowl.\nCheck the dough for texture and temperature. It should be smooth and elastic. If the dough is getting warm, let it rest a bit before you continue processing, as needed, until the dough is elastic.\nTransfer the dough to a clean bowl. There's no need to oil the bowl - there's enough oil in the peanut butter to keep it from sticking too much. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it aside until it has doubled, about 40 minutes, depending on how warm your dough was after processing.\nPunch the dough down and reshape it into a ball and put it back into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and let it rise until doubled again, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.\nWhen the dough has doubled, take it out of the bowl and form it into a log that will fit in the pan. (You can also make a free-form loaf, if you prefer.) Cover the pan with plastic wrap and set it aside to rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.\nWhen the dough has fully risen it should be just a bit above the top of the pan, and if you press it with a fingertip, the indent will remain instead of springing back. Slash the dough as desired, and bake for 45 minutes at 325\u00b0F, until the loaf is brown and sounds hollow when tapped.\nRemove the loaf from the pan and allow to cool on a rack before slicing.\nYeast Breads\nPeanut Butter",
