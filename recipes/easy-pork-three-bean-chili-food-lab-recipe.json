Let stand for 5 minutes, then puree raisins and stock until smooth in a countertop blender or with an immersion blender. Add remaining cup of chicken stock and set aside.\nCarefully pat pork dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over high heat until smoking. Add pork all at once and spread evenly over bottom surface (it's ok if not all the pork is touching the bottom or if the pan is crowded). Cook without moving until bottom surface is well browned, about 8 minutes. Stir pork. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add oregano, chili powder, cumin, and coriander and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and a light patina forms on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes.\nAdd broth/rasin mixture, stirring to release browned bits from bottom of pan. Add tomatoes and their juice, fish sauce, orange juice concentrate (or orange juice) and bay leaf. Season lightly with salt and pepper and bring to a boil.\nReduce to a bare simmer, cover pot leaving lid slightly ajar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is nearly tender, about 1 1/2 hours.\nAdd kidney beans, black beans, and garbanzo or cannellini beans. Continue to cook until pork can be easily shredded with a fork, about 45 minutes longer. Sauce should be thick, with an almost ketchup-like consistency. If too thin, continue to cook, stirring frequently, until reduced to the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt.\nServe chili with diced avocado, cilantro, diced onions, lime wedges, and grated cheese. Chili can be stored in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 5 days.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven\nPork Mains\nStovetop\nBeans\nPork Shoulder\nChili"
