Coat brisket liberally with rub and let sit for at least 40 minutes and up to a day, refrigerated.\nPreheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Place brisket in Dutch oven and cook until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip and brown on second side, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer brisket to a large plate and lower heat to medium.\nAdd shallots, garlic, and tomato paste to Dutch oven. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are softened, about 7 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nAdd beef broth and scrape up browned bits from bottom of pan. Add tomato sauce, apricot preserves, cranberry sauce, dried cranberries, dried apricots, dark brown sugar, molasses, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to combine. Bring sauce to a boil. Nestle brisket in sauce, pouring in any accumulated juices from the plate. Cover Dutch oven and transfer to oven. Cook until brisket can be pierced with a fork with little to no resistance, about 3 hours.\nTransfer brisket to a large container and add sauce. Cover and place in refrigerator overnight and up to 3 days (see notes).\nTo Serve:\nPreheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). Spoon off any congealed fat from sauce. Remove brisket from sauce and cut into 1/4-inch slices against the grain. Place slices in a casserole dish and cover with sauce. Cover dish with foil and place in oven until brisket is warmed through, 30 to 45 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nNotes\nThe brisket can be sliced and served after finished cooking in step 3, but for best results, cool and reheat.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nApricot\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nCranberry\nBeef Mains"
