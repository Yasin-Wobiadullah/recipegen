Allow to soak, agitating them occasionally, until malleable, at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place dried mushrooms in a 2 quart liquid measure and cover with 1 1/2 quarts hot water. Microwave on high power until simmering, about 2 minutes. Set aside and allow mushrooms to soak until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain mushrooms and squeeze dry, reserving soaking liquid. Roughly chop mushrooms into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces\nWhile past and mushrooms soak, place sweet potato in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook until potato shows no resistance when pierced with a knife, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Add maple syrup and 1 tablespoon olive oil and process until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Alternatively, to make without a processor, pass potato through a ricer into a bowl. Whisk in maple syrup and olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nHeat canola or vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat until smoking. Add fresh and soaked mushrooms and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until mushrooms are well browned on all sides, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme, and cook, stirring and tossing constantly until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 2 teaspoons lemon juice and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then transfer to a bowl.\nReturn skillet to high heat. Add white wine and cook, scraping up browned bits with wooden spoon. Allow to reduce by half, then add mushroom soaking liquid along with beans. Simmer until reduced by 1/3, about 5 minutes. Add escarole, remaining soy sauce, and remaining lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. simmer until escarole is lightly softened, about 2 minutes. Pour beans and escarole into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Set aside.\nAdjust oven rack to upper middle position and preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Transfer pasta sheets to a double layer of paper towels and dry them on both sides. Working one piece at a time, lay pasta flat on cutting board with the short end parallel to the edge of the table, the add 1/8th of potato mixture and 1/8th of mushroom mixture to bottom 1/4 of the sheet. Roll the sheet up away from you into a cylinder. Repeat with all 8 rolls.\nNestle rolls into baking dish and moisten tops by spooning a bit of the pan liquid over them. Cover dish tightly with foil and transfer to oven. Bake for 20 minutes, remove foil, and continue baking until tops of cannelloni are browned and crisp.\nPlace immediately, placing two cannelloni on each plate and surrounding them with butter beans and escarole. Sprinkle with parsley and drizzle with additional extra-virgin olive oil.
