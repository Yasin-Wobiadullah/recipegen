Using a very sharp knife, cut beef across the grain into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Place slices between sheets of plastic wrap or wax paper and gently pound with the flat end of a meat pounder, or roll with a heavy rolling pin until paper-thin.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nArrange slices on 6 individual chilled plates. Add arugula to a bowl and toss with 4 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange arugula in a pile in the center of each plate.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nPlace remaining 4 tablespoons oil, lemon juice, mustard, egg yolk, salt and pepper in a 2-cup measure. Use an immersion blender to mix until thick. Drizzle mustard sauce around each plate avoiding arugula. Garnish plates with tomato quarters and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nVery sharp\nknife\n,\nmeat pounder\nor\nrolling pin\n,\nimmersion blender\nNotes\nFor this dish it is best to use baby or wild arugula, but if this is not available, you can use mixed baby salad greens.\nYou can either drizzle your carpaccio dish with a lightly flavored mustard sauce as I have in my recipe, or choose to use a simple lemon vinaigrette. To create your vinaigrette, top your carpaccio with a squeeze of lemon, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.\nRead More\nSteak Tartare Recipe\nSteak Carpaccio Salad Recipe\nCold Steak Salad With Cucumber and Ponzu-Mustard Vinaigrette Recipe\nNo-Cook\nItalian\nBeef\nArugula",
