Form 2 patties slightly wider than the width of the buns, press a dimple in the center of each with your thumb, and season all over with salt. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together olives and mayonnaise. Refrigerate until ready to use.\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil\nthe grilling grate.\nPlace patties directly over hot coals and cook, turning occasionally, until well charred and center of burgers register 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 7 minutes. Place 2 slices of cheese on top of each patty and continue to cook until cheese is melted and burgers register 125\u00b0F (51\u00b0C) for medium rare or 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for medium, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer burgers to a large plate and let rest 5 minutes.

Spread olive mayonnaise on top and bottom halves of each bun. Set patties on bottom buns, close burgers, and serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nMuffaletta Burgers Recipe\nHow to Get Started Grilling\nGuide to Grilling Great Burgers\nThe Food Lab: 10 Tips for Better Burgers\nA Beginner's Guide to Olives: 14 Varieties Worth Seeking Out\nBurgers\nGrilled Beef\nGround Beef",
