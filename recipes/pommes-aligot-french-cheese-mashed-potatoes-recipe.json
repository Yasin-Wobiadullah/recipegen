  "full_text": "Pommes Aligot (Cheesy Mashed Potatoes)\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nTotal\n50 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2\npounds\nYukon Gold potatoes\n(\n24\nounces\n;\n675\ng\n), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks\n2\nsprigs\nthyme\n2\nmedium\ncloves garlic\n,\n1\nwhole and\n1\nminced, divided\n3\ntablespoons\n(\n27\ng\n) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight\n1\nstick\nunsalted butter\n(\n4\nounces\n;\n113\ng\n), cut into tablespoon-size pieces\n1\ncup\nheavy cream\n(\n240\nml\n), warmed, plus more if needed\n10\nounces\n(\n285\ng\n) mixed\nAlpine cheeses\n, such as\nSwiss\n,\nGruy\u00e8re\n,\nComt\u00e9\n, and/or\nFontina\n, grated (see notes)\nDirections\nIn a large saucepan, cover potatoes, thyme, and 1 whole clove garlic with cold water by at least 2 inches. Stir in salt until dissolved. Bring water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until a knife easily pierces potatoes with no resistance, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander, shaking the colander well to get rid of excess water. Discard thyme.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing a ricer or a food mill fitted with the finest disk, pur\u00e9e potatoes back into saucepan (make sure the saucepan is dried), mixing butter cubes in as you go. (If using a food mill, you can add the butter to the potato chunks and work it through the mill; if using a ricer, add the butter to the saucepan with the riced potatoes.) Add remaining 1 clove minced garlic. Set saucepan over medium-low heat. Using a silicone spatula, stir potatoes well until butter and garlic are fully combined. (Alternatively, you can use a wooden spoon for this, though it won't conform to the sides of the pot like silicone will.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSlowly add cream in 3 parts, stirring well until cream is fully incorporated before the next addition. Continue stirring and working potatoes, lowering heat to low if potatoes begin to sizzle and steam, until potato mass feels thickened and sticky, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd grated cheese in small batches, stirring between each addition until cheese is fully melted and incorporated. Continue stirring potatoes until they become thick, silky, smooth, and elastic (do not worry about overworking the potatoes in this recipe, since you want to develop that starch), about 3 minutes longer. The aligot should form long, stretchy strands when you lift it from the pot.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSeason with salt. The aligot should be thick, with a very slow-flowing viscosity, like cooling lava; if too thick, work in additional cream in small amounts until it is loose enough.\nTransfer to a warmed serving dish and serve right away. Aligot is traditionally served with sausages and meats, but you can also serve it with roasted vegetables or on a bed of polenta. Leftover aligot can be refrigerated in a sealed container. To reheat, add to a saucepan with a small amount of cream. Bring cream to a simmer before stirring it in, then continue to cook, adding more cream as necessary, until aligot is heated through and consistency is correct.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRicer\nor\nfood mill\nNotes\nThe traditional cheese in aligot is called tome fra\u00eeche, but it's hard to find outside of France. Instead, use any combination of semi-firm Alpine cheeses with good melting ability, such as Swiss, Gruy\u00e8re, Fontina, and/or Comt\u00e9.\nRead More\nPommes Pur\u00e9e (Rich and Creamy Mashed Potatoes)\nClassic Rich and Silky Potato Gratin (Scalloped Potatoes)\nUltra-Fluffy Mashed Potatoes\nFoolproof Cheese Fondue\nVegetarian Sides\nVegetarian\nPotatoes\nFrench\nGruyere"
