Cover and blend on high speed until mixture takes on a greenish tint, about 10 seconds. Taste and adjust for salt, then set aside.\nHeat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Add mustard seeds and curry leaves, coat with oil, and cook until the mustard seeds begin to crackle and pop, 1 minute or less. Immediately remove from heat and add to blender. Stir mixture together until well combined, then serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nMost of the ingredients for this drink can be found in any supermarket, but you'll likely have to seek out\nasafoetida\nand curry leaves at an Indian grocery. Asafoetida, also known as hing, will last for years in your pantry, but fresh curry leaves are far more perishable, so pat your extras dry, seal them up in a zip-top bag, suck out the air, and keep them in the freezer until you need them again.\nRead More\nHow to Stock an Indian Pantry\nHow to Make Tadka\nCucumber Raita (Indian Yogurt Condiment)\nSmoothies\nIndian\nButtermilk"
