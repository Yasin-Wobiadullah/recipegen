Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Pour the oil into a small saucepan, and turn the heat to medium. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the ginger and cook until it is also fragrant, about one minute. Pour in the sauce, stir well, and wait for it to come to a boil. Then add the scallions, turn off the heat, and stir to combine. Set aside.\nFor the steamed salmon: Fill a large pot with a steamer tray halfway up with water, and bring to a boil.\nMeanwhile, find a heatproof plate or nonreactive cake or pie pan that will hold the salmon fillets and will also fit in the steamer tray with about 1 inch left around the edges. Toss half of the white scallion strips into the pan, and then place the salmon fillets on top. Pour the sauce on top of the salmon.\nTransfer the pan to the steamer tray. Cover the pot, and cook until fish is cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. A knife should be able to be inserted into the thicket part of the flesh easily. When done, turn off the heat, and carefully remove the pan with the fish.\nTransfer the fish to a platter and pour the sauce and juices on top. Garnish with the remaining scallion strips and the cilantro.\nRead More\nThai-Style Sweet and Sour Steamed Fish Recipe\nChinese Steamed Whole Fish With Fermented Black Beans and Garlic\nSalmon\nVietnamese\nStovetop Seafood\nSeafood Mains\nQuick Dinners",
