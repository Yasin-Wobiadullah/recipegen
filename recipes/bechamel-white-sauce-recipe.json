Add flour and whisk to form a paste. Continue to cook, stirring, until raw flour scent is gone, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, add milk in a thin, steady stream, or in increments of a couple of tablespoons at a time, whisking thoroughly and getting into all corners of the pan to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nHeat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSeason with salt and pepper. Add nutmeg to taste, if using. If any lumps form, simply whisk thoroughly to remove them and smooth out sauce, or use a hand blender or countertop blender if lumps are particularly large or tough. Use sauce right away, or press a piece of plastic wrap over surface of sauce to prevent a skin from forming and keep warm until ready to use. Sauce can be cooled and stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for several days. Reheat very gently on the stovetop or in a microwave to use.\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk\nNotes\nThis recipe uses a ratio of 1 1/2 tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk, producing a sauce that's luxuriously silky and thick, but still quite pourable\u2014it will work well in a variety of dishes. Depending on the recipe and your personal preference, you can make a thinner b\u00e9chamel by reducing the flour and butter to 1 tablespoon each per cup of milk, or a very thick one (say, for a souffl\u00e9 base or Greek moussaka) by increasing them to 3 tablespoons each per cup of milk. You can easily scale this recipe up or down as desired.\nRead More\nHow to Make a Roux and Use It Right\nClassic Mornay Sauce (Cheesy White Sauce) Recipe\nCheesy, Gooey Croques Monsieurs Recipe\nSavory Cheese Souffl\u00e9 Recipe\nClassic Baked Lasagna Bolognese (Lasagne alla Bolognese) Recipe\nCondiments & Sauces\nFrench",
