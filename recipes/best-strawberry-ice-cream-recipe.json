In a mixing bowl, combine strawberries with 1/2 cup sugar and alcohol and let stand in refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn a countertop blender, process remaining strawberries until very smooth, about 30 seconds. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer to filter out all seeds and fibers, then measure and reserve 1 1/2 cups pur\u00e9e. Extra pur\u00e9e, if there is any, can be put to another use.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn a clean mixing bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups strawberry pur\u00e9e with half-and-half, corn syrup, and remaining 3/4 cup sugar until fully combined. Add salt to taste, and, if mixture is too sweet, a few drops of lemon juice.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nChill in refrigerator until base is very cold, at least 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0C), about to 2 to 3 hours. Churn in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. In the last minute of churning, retrieve strawberry mix-ins from the refrigerator, strain off syrup, and add mix-ins to the churn; reserve strawberry syrup for another use (it makes a great daiquiri). Transfer ice cream to airtight container and chill in freezer for at least 4 hours before serving.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\n,\nblender\nNotes\nThe quality of this ice cream depends entirely on your strawberries. Use impeccably ripe ones while they're in season; those giant store-bought berries won't taste the same. Strawberry amounts are approximate; final yields can vary, so this recipe may call for more fruit than you actually need.\nRead More\nFruity No-Churn Ice Cream Recipe\nHomemade Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Bars Recipe\nStrawberry Sorbet Recipe\nTaste-Test: 8 Supermarket Strawberry Ice Creams\nIce Cream\nStrawberry"
