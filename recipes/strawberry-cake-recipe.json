Pur\u00e9e fresh strawberries with an immersion blender, food processor, or countertop blender until perfectly smooth; bring to about 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) before using.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Lightly grease three 8-inch anodized-aluminum cake pans and\nline with parchment\n. If you don\u2019t have 3 pans, it\u2019s okay to bake the cakes in stages, as the batter will keep at room temperature until needed.\nTo Make the Cake:\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine butter, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and Chinese five-spice powder. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWith mixer still running, add egg whites a little at a time, letting each addition fully incorporate before proceeding to the next. Scrape bowl and beater with flexible spatula, then resume mixing on low. Sprinkle in about one-third of strawberry flour, then drizzle in one-third of strawberry pur\u00e9e. Repeat with remaining flour and fruit, working in thirds as before.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nScrape bowl and beater with flexible spatula and resume mixing on medium speed for about 3 seconds to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering between 65 and 68\u00b0F (18 and 20\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.)\nFold batter once or twice from the bottom up, using flexible spatula, until the color is completely homogeneous, then divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 23 ounces/655g each if you have a scale). Stagger pans together on oven rack and bake until puffed and firm, about 30 minutes or to an internal temperature of 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). If your oven has very uneven heat, pause to rotate pans after about 20 minutes. Alternatively, bake 2 layers at once and finish the third when they\u2019re done.\nSerious Eats /Vicky Wasik\nCool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off parchment, and return cakes right side up. (Covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours.) Meanwhile, prepare your frosting of choice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Crumb Coat:\nLevel cakes with a serrated knife (full instructions\nhere\n) and set the scraps aside for snacking. Place 1 layer on a heavy cast iron turntable. If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup frosting, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with the second and third layers, then cover sides of cake with another cup of frosting, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorial\nhere\n). Refrigerate cake until frosting is firm, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Finish:\nDecorate chilled cake with remaining frosting (excess can be paired with scraps for a snack), then let cake stand at room temperature until about 70\u00b0F to serve. Immediately before slicing, garnish with crushed freeze-dried strawberries.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCut into wedges with a chef\u2019s knife to serve. Cover exposed cake with extra frosting to keep leftovers moist. The cake will keep about 24 hours at room temperature. Wrapped in plastic, it can be refrigerated up to 5 days; return to room temperature to serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nIf using an unvarnished aluminum paddle attachment, be sure it\u2019s meticulously clean and free from oxidized residue. If you\u2019re not sure, wipe the paddle firmly with a damp paper towel until no trace of gray remains on the cloth, as this will cause the acidic batter to discolor in the oven. For more information,\nconsult KitchenAid\u2019s Product Help Sheet\n.\nThe success of this recipe hinges on the unique behavior, pH, and starch content of bleached cake flour; other kinds of flour will produce a cake that's gummy and dense. For more information, please consult this article on\nbleached cake flour\n. This batter is also formulated to the specific pH and moisture content of strawberries; it cannot be made with any other type of fruit.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nimmersion blender\nor\ncountertop blender\n(optional),\nstand mixer\n(see notes), two or three\n8-inch anodized-aluminum cake pans\n(preferably 3 inches deep),\nserrated knife\n,\ncast iron turntable\n(optional),\n7-inch offset spatula\n,\nwire rack\n,\ndigital thermometer\nRead More\nFast and Easy Cream Cheese Frosting\nGuide to the Best Cake Pans\nHow to Level a Layer Cake\nWhy You'll Never Find Unbleached Cake Flour in My Pantry\nLayer Cake\nStrawberry\nEaster",
