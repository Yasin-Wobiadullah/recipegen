Add dried shrimp and 1 tablespoon (15g) peanuts and continue to pound until slightly broken down, taking care not to over-pound and form a peanut paste, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd palm sugar and continue to pound lightly while also working the pestle in a circular motion while applying gentle pressure to help dissolve the palm sugar, about 30 seconds. Add long beans and pound until slightly broken down, 15 to 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and pound gently just until the tomatoes release their juices, about 15 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd lime juice and fish sauce and stir with pestle using a circular motion until well combined and palm sugar is fully dissolved, about 15 seconds. Add green papaya. Holding a large spoon in your non-dominant hand while holding the pestle in your dominant hand, pound down the sides of the mortar (not the center) while simultaneously using the spoon to move the ingredients back and forth in the mortar until ingredients are well combined and green papaya has begun to absorb the dressing, about 30 seconds. Take care not to over-pound the green papaya or it will lose its crisp texture.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd remaining 1 tablespoon (15g) peanuts and pound gently just until they are slightly broken down. Transfer salad to a serving plate, and serve immediately with sticky rice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nClay or wooden mortar and wooden pestle\n.\nNotes\nYou can adjust the spiciness of this salad to suit your taste by reducing or increasing the amount of fresh Thai chiles in the recipe.\nDried shrimp can be found in Asian markets and also online.\nPalm sugar can be found in Southeast Asian markets, as well as some nationwide supermarkets like HMart, and also online. At room temperature, palm sugar is a solid mass and needs to be softened so that it can be incorporated into the dressing. You can soften palm sugar by microwaving at full power in a microwave-safe bowl for approximately 15 seconds. If you can\u2019t find palm sugar, for this recipe you can substitute with an equal amount of light brown sugar.\nGreen papaya is an unripe papaya that is pale white/green when peeled. Unlike a ripe orange papaya, green papaya is not sweet, and has a very crisp texture. You can find detailed instructions on how to shred green papaya\nhere\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nGreen papaya can be shredded in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 24 hours. The finished salad is best enjoyed immediately, as the green papaya will soften considerably the longer it sits in the dressing.\nRead More\nA Guide to Thai-Style Salads\nTam Khao Pod Kai Kem (Thai Corn Salad With Salted Duck Egg) Recipe\nThai\nQuick Salads\nFruit\nNo-Cook Salads\nThe Latest",
