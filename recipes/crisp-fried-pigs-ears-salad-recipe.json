Add the ears and let boil for 2 or 3 minutes to get rid of some of the impurities. Remove the ears from the pot and set aside.\nIn a medium-size pot, arrange the ears along with the rest of the ingredients. Add enough water to cover the ears. Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered, for 2 hours. The ears should be very supple and easily pierced through with forks or chopsticks.\nRemove the ears from the broth and let cool. Reserve the stock for another use.\nWhen cooled, cut the ears into 1\u20444 inch slivers. Toss with the cornstarch and flour, until the ears are lightly and uniformly covered.\nIn the meantime, bring the oil to 350\u00b0F in a wok or frying pot.\nGently slip into the hot oil and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until the ears are golden brown and crispy. Very carefully stir the ears around in the pot, so that the slivers won't stick to one another. Remove the ears from the oil with a slotted spoon, and serve immediately.\nPork\nFrying"
