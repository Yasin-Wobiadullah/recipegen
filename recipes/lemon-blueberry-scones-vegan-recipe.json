Transfer to a medium bowl, then toss with blueberries and lemon zest. Stir in coconut milk with a flexible spatula to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, pat into a 7-inch round, and refrigerate 15 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).\nTo Bake:\nUsing a chef\u2019s knife, cut chilled wheel of dough into 6 wedges. Sprinkle generously with toasted or turbinado sugar, if using, and arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Bake until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes, and serve warm.\nSpecial equipment\nFood processor\n, parchment paper,\nhalf sheet pan\nNotes\nTo keep the flavor of the scones neutral, reach for refined coconut oil; if you'd prefer a slightly tropical aroma, try virgin coconut oil instead. In either case, it's important to use cans of unsweetened, full-fat coconut milk, not the stuff that's watered down and sold in refrigerated cartons.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nAccidentally Vegan: Fresh and Light Lemon-Blueberry Scones\nFreeze Scone Dough to Bake Up a Breakfast Treat Any Time\nScones\nRolls & Buns\nBlueberry\nLemon\nEaster Side Dishes"
