Stir in vanilla bean and seeds, cover, and let steep for 1 hour. Remove bean, wash away dairy, and set aside to dry. Spent bean can be added to a jar of sugar to make vanilla sugar.\nWhisk together egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until well-combined and light in color. Slowly pour yolk mixture into dairy mixture, whisking well to combine. Cook custard on low heat, whisking frequently, until it thickens, coating the back of a spoon but leaving a clean line when swiped with a finger.\nStrain into an airtight container, then stir in vanilla extract and Scotch. Add salt to taste. Chill overnight, then churn the next day according to manufacturer's instructions. Eat immediately as soft-serve or let firm up in freezer for 2 to 3 hours.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nNotes\nTo play against such a floral whisky I use Mexican vanilla bean, which has a powerful spicy funk. Avoid Mexican vanilla extracts, which are often cut with cheaper, potentially toxic ingredients. Mexican vanilla beans are amazing, but should come from sources you trust.\nRead More\nThe Real Rules of Making Boozy Ice Cream\nNo-Churn Vanilla Ice Cream\nBourbon-Vanilla Ice Cream\nIce Cream\nHeavy Cream"
