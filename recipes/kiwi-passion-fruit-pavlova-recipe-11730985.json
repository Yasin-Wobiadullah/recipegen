Line a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk cornstarch and 1 1/2 cups (300 g; 10 1/2 ounces) sugar; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or using a hand mixer and a large bowl, beat egg whites on medium speed until light, fluffy, and soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. With the mixer still running on medium, slowly add sugar mixture, one tablespoon at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Continue beating until meringue is thick, glossy, and holds firm peaks when you lift the whisk, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Using a flexible spatula, scrape bottom and sides of the bowl. With the mixer running on medium speed, drizzle in vinegar and vanilla, and continue beating until fully incorporated.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nScrape meringue onto center of prepared baking sheet. Using a flexible spatula or the back of a spoon, spread and smooth meringue from center outward into a 9-inch disc, creating a rim that is about 1/4-inch higher around the edges.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nPlace in oven and immediately reduce temperature to 225\u00b0F (110\u00b0C). Bake until meringue is dry and pale beige, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn oven off and allow meringue to cool in the oven with the door closed, at least 2 hours and up to 16.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nTo Assemble:\nIn a small bowl, stir passion fruit pulp with 1 tablespoon (15 g; 1/2 ounce) sugar to combine. In another small bowl, stir kiwis and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons (6 g) sugar. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nIn the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or using a hand mixer, beat cream and confectioners\u2019 sugar on medium speed until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nCarefully peel parchment away from bottom of meringue and transfer meringue to a cake stand or large platter. Spoon whipped cream into depression of the meringue, followed by the passion fruit pulp and kiwi slices. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\n13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet, parchment paper, stand mixer or hand mixer, flexible spatula, cake stand or large platter\nNotes\nIf using fresh passion fruit, you will need 2 to 3 medium passion fruit for 1/3 cup of pulp.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce cooled, the meringue can be stored in an airtight container, ideally with a silica packet, for up to 5 days at room temperature but may soften as it sits. Once assembled, pavlova should be eaten immediately.\nDesserts\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nFruit\nSummer Desserts",
