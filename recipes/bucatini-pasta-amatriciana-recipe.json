Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/4 cup pasta cooking water. Cook over high heat, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce has thickened and begins to coat noodles. Remove from heat, add cheese, and stir rapidly to incorporate. Season to taste with more salt and pepper. Serve right away, passing more cheese at the table.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet\n,\ntongs\nNotes\nGuanciale (cured pork jowl) will give the sauce the best texture, but if your best option is good pancetta, use it instead.\nBucatini is a type of thick, hollow spaghetti; you can substitute regular spaghetti, or even penne.\nRead More\nPasta alla Gricia Recipe\nSpaghetti With Carbonara Sauce Recipe\nGricia, Amatriciana, Carbonara: The Origins of Rome's Pasta Classics\nDoes Adding Pasta Water Really Make a Difference?\nThe Right Way to Sauce Pasta\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine\nPancetta & Guanciale\nTomato Sauces"
