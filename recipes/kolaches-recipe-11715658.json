Let cool off heat for 10 minutes, then transfer to a food processor and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl or clean glass jar and refrigerate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nIf Making With Cream Cheese Filling:\nIn a food processor, add cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Process until well combined and sugar dissolves, about 1 minute, scraping down the sides of the food processor jar as needed. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready for use.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nFor the Posypka (Streusel topping):\nIn a bowl, whisk flour, sugar, and cinnamon to combine. Add butter and rub between fingers until mixture resembles wet sand. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nFor the Kolaches Dough:\nIn a 2-cup liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk together milk, melted butter, and egg yolks to combine (butter may form clumps; this is fine).\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk flour, sugar, yeast, and salt to combine. Fit stand mixer with dough hook, and with mixer running on low speed, slowly pour milk mixture into flour mixture, and knead on low speed until no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough clears sides of bowl but still sticks to bottom, 8 to 12 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nTransfer dough to a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Proof at warm room temperature (70 to 74\u2109) until dough it doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nOnce dough has risen, line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u2109 (175\u2103). Punch down dough and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Roll dough into a 3-inch wide log, then cut and portion dough into twelve 2-ounce pieces.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nForm each dough piece into a rough ball by pinching and pulling dough edges under so that top is smooth. On clean counter, cup each ball with your palm and roll into smooth, tight ball.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nArrange dough balls on prepared parchment-lined baking sheet, spaced evenly apart in 3 rows of 4. Brush tops with remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let proof at room temperature until puffed up but not quite doubled in size, 30 to 60 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nGrease the bottom of a glass jar, cup, or a measuring cup with 2 1/2- to 3-inch diameter with cooking spray or neutral oil, and make a deep indentation in center of each dough ball by slowly pressing cup into the dough on sheet. The indentations should be deep enough to fit about 1 tablespoon of filling.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nBrush prepared egg wash evenly over the dough. Divide your choice of either the strawberry or cheese filling evenly among kolaches (about 1 heaping tablespoon per kolache) and smooth with back of spoon. Sprinkle streusel topping evenly over kolaches.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nBake until golden brown, about 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. The kolaches' edges will touch and fuse together when baking. Let buns cool on pan for at least 30 minutes, then carefully pull apart. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nSpecial Equipment\nSmall saucepan, food processor, 2-cup liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, stand mixer with dough hook attachment, parchment paper, a glass jar, cup, or a measuring cup with 2 1/2- to 3-inch diameter\nNotes\nThis recipe can be easily doubled and baked in batches.\nThe two most common kolache fillings are fruit jam and cheese. This recipe includes both filling options, with each filling recipe written to make enough for a full batch. If you\u2019d like to make both, halve each filling recipe to prepare 6 of each or double the dough to make a full batch of each.\nStore-bought fruit jam of your choice may be substituted for freshly made, but you may need to reduce it further in order to get a thick enough consistency that the jam doesn't run out of the kolaches while baking.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe fillings can be made and refrigerated for up to 4 days before using.\nThe baked kolaches can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nPastries\nEastern European",
