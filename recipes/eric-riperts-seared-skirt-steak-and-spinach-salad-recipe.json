Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook until reduced by half. Turn off the heat and discard parsley and thyme sprigs. Add cracked pepper and season with salt to taste. Whisk in red wine vinegar and olive oil, and set aside.\nPour canola oil into a large cast-iron skillet set over high heat. Season steaks with salt and pepper on both sides. When oil starts to smoke, add steaks. For medium-rare, cook for two to three minutes a side. When done, set steaks aside on a cutting board and let them rest for at least five minutes.\nWhile steaks are resting, warm vinaigrette back up in the saucepan over low heat. Combine spinach and mushrooms in a large bowl, and then stir in just enough of warm vinaigrette to lightly dress the greens. Start with a few tablespoons and go from there. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nDivide salad mixture between four plates. Slice steaks against the grain into 1/4-inch pieces, and then divide the slices up between the plates. Drizzle a little more of the vinaigrette on top of the slices. Serve immediately.\nBeef Mains\nSkirt Steaks\nSpinach\nSalads"
