Season with salt and pepper. Set aside or refrigerate until ready to serve.\nFor the Fritters:\nPreheat oven to 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) and set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Grate zucchini on the large holes of a box grater, or use the shredding blade of a food processor. Transfer shredded zucchini to colander set over a bowl or in the sink. Repeat with the onion, then add to the zucchini.\nToss zucchini and onion with 1 teaspoon salt and let stand for 10 minutes. Using your hands or a clean dish towel, squeeze out as much of the liquid from the zucchini and onion as possible. Transfer zucchini mixture to a large bowl and add corn kernels. Stir in eggs, garlic, black pepper, flour, baking powder, and shredded cheese until thoroughly combined and no dry flour remains.\nIn a large cast iron or heavy stainless steel skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, carefully drop scant 1/3 cupful of the zucchini batter into the skillet, then press down on them with the cup to flatten them to about 1/4 inch thick.\nCook until the bottom side is golden brown, about 4 minutes (the corn will have a tendency to pop in the hot pan, so be careful; you may want to use a splatter guard or lid to shield yourself). If the fritters darken too quickly, reduce the heat to medium. Flip the fritters and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer fritters to the prepared baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with remaining batter, keeping the pan well-oiled as you go.\nServe fritters warm, with a dollop of herb sour cream on top.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\ncast iron\nor heavy\nstainless steel skillet\n;\nbox grater\nor\nfood processor\nwith shredding blade attached,\ncolander\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\nRead More\nKolokithokeftedes (Greek Zucchini Fritters) with Tzatziki Recipe\nZucchini Latkes With Parmesan, Pine Nuts, and Basil Recipe\nTod Man Khao Pod (Thai Corn Fritters) Recipe\nFrying\nSour Cream\nCorn\nZucchini & Yellow Squash\nVegetable Sides"
