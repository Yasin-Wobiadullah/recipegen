  "full_text": "How to Make Homemade Vanilla Extract\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n3 hrs\nTotal\n3 hrs 10 mins\nMakes\n3 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n83\ng\ngrade B vanilla beans\n(\n2.9\nounces\n; about\n31\nbeans\n), halved lengthwise (see note)\n1\n750 ml bottle\nof\n80-proof vodka\n(\n25.4\nfluid ounces\n;\n3\ncups\nplus\n2\ntablespoons\n), such as\nTito\u2019s\nDirections\nSet up an immersion circulator and preheat water bath to 146\u00b0F (63.5\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nPlace the halved vanilla beans in a 1-liter (33.8-ounce) glass jar. Add the vodka to the jar and use a fork or slotted spoon to push the vanilla beans down so that they are completely submerged in the vodka. Seal jar and gently lower into water bath; the water should reach just below the lid of the jar. Set a heavy mug, small bowl (filled with water, if necessary), or other weight on top of the jar to keep it from floating, and cover the top of the water bath with aluminum foil followed by a kitchen towel. Cook for 3 hours.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing tongs, carefully remove jar from water bath (if you don\u2019t want to deal with the hot water, you can also turn off the immersion circulator and let the water cool before removing the jar\u2014this just takes a while). Allow vanilla extract to cool to room temperature (overnight is best). At this point, you can remove the beans from the extract and reserve them for other uses, or you can leave them in the liquid. (I recommend leaving them in the liquid; it\u2019s the perfect place to park them until you need to fish them out for another use, and the flavor of the extract will only get better over time.) Either way, store the extract in a cool, dark place.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nimmersion circulator (sous vide machine), 1-liter (33.8-oz) glass jar with a tight lid\nNotes\nGrade B vanilla beans, also sold as \u201cextract grade,\u201d are a tad drier than their Grade A counterparts and may have superficial imperfections, but they are less expensive and contain all the flavor you need. They are available from\nNative Vanilla\nand\nSlofoodgroup\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nVanilla extract can be stored in an airtight jar or bottle in a cool, dark area. The vanilla extract won\u2019t necessarily go \u201cbad,\u201d but for optimal flavor, the beans should be removed within 2 years and the liquid extract should be used within 5 years.\nSous Vide\nThe Latest\nFood Science",
