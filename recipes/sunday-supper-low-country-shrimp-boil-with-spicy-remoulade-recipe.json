Cook for 7 more minutes, then add shrimp and cook until shrimp just turns pink and is no longer translucent, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jennifer Olvera\nImmediately drain cooking liquid using a colander and discard lemons and bay leaves. Pour potatoes, corn, sausage, and shrimp into a large serving bowl, platter, or on top of a paper-covered table. Sprinkle with additional Old Bay, if desired, and serve with prepared sauce, Tabasco, and napkins.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nstockpot\n,\ncolander\nNotes\nCooking times here are approximate. Timing is everything when it comes to a seafood boil, but the time ingredients will take depends largely on factors like potato size and whether or not shrimp are frozen. In other words, visual cues are key, as is making sure the potatoes are cooked through by poking them with a fork or skewer.\nRead More\nA Comprehensive Guide to Buying Better Shrimp\nLow Country Boil\nLobster Boil\nLowcountry Stew Chicken\nStovetop Seafood\nSausages\nShrimp\nCorn\nRed Potatoes"
