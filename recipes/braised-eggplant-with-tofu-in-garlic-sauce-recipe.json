Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, cover steamer, and cook until eggplant is completely tender, about 10 minutes. Set aside.\nWhile eggplant is cooking, make the sauce. Combine vinegar, wine, and cornstarch and stir with fork until cornstarch is dissolved. Add soy sauce, brown sugar, chile paste, and sesame oil. Set aside.\nWipe out wok and dry carefully. Add oil and whole garlic cloves. Heat over medium heat stirring and turning garlic cloves occasionally until light golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Discard whole cloves then increase heat to high and heat oil until smoking. Add sliced garlic, scallion whites, and preserved mustard root. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly until fragrant and just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Stir sauce to re-incorporate corn starch, then add to wok, stirring constantly. Add eggplant and tofu and fold gently to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, folding and stirring occasionally until thick and glossy, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in scallion greens and cilantro and serve immediately with white rice, if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nwok\n, bamboo steamer insert (or microwave, see note), wok spatula\nNotes\nChinkiang vinegar is a black vinegar that can be found at most Asian supermarkets. Rice vinegar can be used in its place. Preserved mustard root can be found in the canned or jarred section of an Asian market, sometimes labeled preserved or pickled Sichuan vegetable (check the ingredients label for mustard root).\nThe eggplant can be par-cooked in the microwave if you don't own a bamboo steamer. To cook, line a large microwave-proof plate with paper towels. Place eggplant on top and microwave on high power until eggplant is completely tender, 5 to 8 minutes (be careful, plate will be very hot).\nRead More\nThe Full Wok Accessory Guide\nSichuan-Style Braised Eggplant with Pickled Chiles and Garlic\nChinese\nDairy-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nBraised & Stewed Vegetables",
