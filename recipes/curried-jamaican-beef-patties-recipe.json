Add the mixture to food processor and pulse until dough is combined (will still look loose but should hold together when you ball up a bit in your hand). Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape into a 2-inch-thick disk. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nFor the Filling:\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, brown ground beef, breaking meat into little bits and stirring occasionally. When beef is nearly cooked through, about 6 minutes, reduce heat to medium and add onion, Scotch bonnet pepper, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables have softened, 4 to 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nAdd broth, Pickapeppa sauce, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, cayenne, curry, allspice, salt, bay leaves, and thyme to beef mixture in saut\u00e9 pan, stirring to combine. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Discard bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Season with additional salt to taste, if needed. Add breadcrumbs and stir thoroughly.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\nFlour your work surface and rolling pin. Roll out dough to an 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough into 6-inch circles and place 2 heaping tablespoons of meat filling onto half of each round of dough. Brush edges of dough with egg wash. Fold dough over filling to make a half-moon shape. Press edge with tines of a fork to seal. Brush tops lightly with remaining egg wash.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSet patties on a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake until dough is golden brown and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nwhisk\n,\nrolling pin\n,\n6-inch round cookie cutter\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nIf you're planning on serving these to a crowd, it's possible to par-bake them 3/4 of the way. Just remove them from the oven after about 25 minutes. Prior to serving, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and finish cooking them for another 15 or so minutes, until the crust is cooked through and the filling is warm.\nJamaican\nGround Beef\nSnacks & Appetizers",
