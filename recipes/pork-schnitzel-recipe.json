Repeat with remaining cutlets. Season pork cutlets with salt and pepper.\nFill a wide, shallow bowl or high-rimmed plate with flour, a second bowl or plate with beaten eggs, and a third bowl or plate with panko.\nWorking with one cutlet at a time, dredge a cutlet in flour with your left hand, shaking off excess. Transfer to egg dish, then turn pork with your right hand to coat both sides. Lift with your right hand and allow excess egg to drain off, then transfer to bread crumbs. With your left hand, scoop bread crumbs on top of pork, then gently press, turning pork to ensure a good layer of crumbs on both sides. Using your left hand, transfer cutlet to a clean parchment-lined baking sheet, then repeat with remaining cutlets. Be careful not to over-bread the cutlets.\nHeat oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering and just shy of smoking. Working with one cutlet at a time, gently lower cutlet into hot fat, laying it down away from you to prevent both hot oil from splashing toward you and the cutlet from sticking to the bottom of the skillet.
