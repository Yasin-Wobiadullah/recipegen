Shake colander to drain off excess liquid and gently pat cucumbers dry with paper towels. In an empty bowl, toss dried cucumber slices with the lemon juice and dill (if using); set aside until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nMeanwhile, use a serrated knife to trim crusts from bread slices to form roughly 2 1/2\u2013 by 2 1/2\u2013inch bread squares.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nSpread butter or cream cheese evenly on 1 side of each bread slice. Top half of the buttered bread slices with the cucumber slices (about 6 cucumber slices per bread slice). Top with the remaining bread slices, buttered sides down. Press down gently on sandwiches to adhere fillings.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nUsing a sharp knife, cut each sandwich into triangles and arrange attractively on a serving platter. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nSpecial Equipment\nColander, serrated knife\nNotes\nIf using cream cheese in this recipe, I recommend using Philadelphia Original Whipped cream cheese. The acidity and tang of the cream cheese pairs well with the mildly flavored cucumber, while the whipped style spreads easily on the bread without tearing it.\nThis recipe can easily be scaled up or down to suit your serving needs.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe prepared sandwiches can be wrapped tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 6 hours.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nThe Latest\nCucumbers\nSandwiches\nNo-Cook",
