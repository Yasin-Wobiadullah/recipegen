Proceed immediately to next step, or for best results, marinate for about 30 minutes or up to 2 days.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdjust broiler rack to 4 inches from heat source and preheat broiler or toaster oven broiler to high. Cover a small broiler pan with aluminum foil. Place black cod fillets skin side down on pan. Broil until top surface is well charred and a thin skewer inserted into black cod shows no resistance at all when piercing through layers of flesh, about 10 minutes. If any areas of fish threaten to burn, shield with small pieces of aluminum foil.\nSerious Eats / J.
