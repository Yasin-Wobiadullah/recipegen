In a medium bowl, whisk eggs, milk, melted butter, and espresso powder (if using) until well combined. Pour liquid ingredients into dry and gently mix until batter is just combined and moistened (there will still be lumps). Do not overmix the batter.\nVery lightly butter a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Drop 2 heaping tablespoons batter in hot skillet and spread into a 3 to 3 1/2-inch disc. Space discs at least 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart. Cook until bottoms of pancakes are set, edges are just starting to set and some very small bubbles are just starting to form on tops, about 1 minute. Using a lightly greased silicone spatula, carefully flip pancakes and continue to cook until done, about 1 minute more. Adjust heat as needed to prevent excess browning; wipe skillet clean and butter as needed between batches. Keep pancakes warm (see notes).\nFor the Chocolate Sauce:\nIn a small saucepan, heat milk to just simmering over medium heat. Add chocolate; remove from heat and whisk until smooth. Whisk in vanilla. Serve immediately over pancakes.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh sieve, whisk, large\nnonstick skillet\n, silicone\nspatula\nNotes\nMake sure to use\nregular cocoa powder\nin this recipe, not\nDutch cocoa powder\n.\nMaple syrup or raspberry preserves are good substitutes for the chocolate sauce.\nTo keep the pancakes warm, tent them in foil or place them in an oven preheated to 300\u00baF (150\u00baC) until ready to serve.\nRead More\nRoasted Banana Chocolate Pancakes\nBaileys Irish Cream Pancakes\nRum and Pear Pancakes\nPancakes With Apricot-Bourbon Sauce\nPancakes\nBreakfast & Brunch\nChocolate",
