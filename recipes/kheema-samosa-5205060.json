Drizzle oil over the flour and rub it in with your fingertips. Once the fat is completely incorporated into the flour, the mixture will take on a crumbly appearance.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nSet bowl on stand mixer, and fit with dough hook attachment. Add 1/3 cup (80ml) of chilled water and mix on low speed until dough comes together in a ball, adding extra water 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time as needed to form a cohesive dough; it should not be too sticky or wet, nor should it be dry and crumbly. Stop the mixer, scrape down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula, then continue to knead on low speed until dough is smooth and slightly elastic to the touch, pliable and resistant to tearing, but not tough, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, the dough can be prepared by hand, or in a food processor; while the timing will vary, the dough should be worked until a similar texture is achieved.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nThe dough should weigh about 1 pound (455g). Wrap dough in plastic, and let it rest at cool room temperature, around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), until dough is pliable, and jumps back when gently pressed, at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours. For a longer rest, it can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours, then brought to cool room temperature, around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), before use.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nFor the Lamb Kheema Filling:\nIn a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add garam masala, turmeric, and chile powder and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add ground meat, and using a wooden spoon, break it into small pieces. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up any clumps, until meat is browned, and most of the liquid it released has evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nReduce heat to low, add peas, sprinkle flour over meat mixture, and stir to combine. Remove from heat, then add chiles, cilantro, and vinegar. Season with salt to taste, and drain off any excess fat. If making samosas right away, let filling cool to room temperature, between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C), before using. Alternatively, transfer filling to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use. Allow to come to room temperature before stuffing into dough.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nFor Filling, Frying and Serving the Samosas:\nDivide dough into 10 equal portions by weight, and shape each into a ball over a cool and dry surface using minimal flour. If the kitchen is warm, read up on our\nhot-weather baking tips\n. Transfer dough balls to a lightly floured baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Fill a small bowl with water.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nWorking with one ball of dough at a time, roll out dough to form a 7-inch (17cm) circle. Using a sharp knife, cut the circle in half; return to the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough balls.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nWorking with one semicircle at a time, wet a fingertip in the bowl of water and dab halfway down the straight edge, and then fold the wet end over the dry side, pressing gently to seal. This will form a triangular pocket. Hold the pocket open like a little waffle cone, and gently spoon in 40g (about 3 tablespoons) kheema filling. Dab the tip of a finger in water and moisten the inner flap of dough, then fold it over the filling, and press gently to seal it against the dough on the other side, then gently pinch each corner of the samosa to ensure all three points are well sealed.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nTransfer samosa to a lightly floured baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Repeat the process with remaining dough and filling. Prior to frying, if the dough seems to have warmed up too much and feels too soft, briefly refrigerate samosas until dough is just firm. (If allowed to chill completely, the interiors may not properly cook through.)\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C). Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet, and set aside. In a large Dutch oven, add enough oil to reach a depth of at least 2 inches (5cm), leaving a few inches to spare at the top. Heat oil to 340\u00b0F (170\u00b0C) over medium-high heat. When oil comes to temperature, brush any excess flour from the samosas (see notes). Fry samosas, 5 at a time, turning them occasionally, until golden brown and puffed on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes (the oil temperature will drop significantly once the samosas are added; adjust heat to maintain temperature between 325-340\u00b0F/165-170\u00b0C). Avoid overcrowding the pot, as too many samosas will reduce the temperature of the oil and make the finished pastry soggy. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer cooked samosas to prepared baking sheet, and transfer to oven to keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nSkim any browned bits from oil and discard. Return oil to 340\u00b0F (170\u00b0C), and repeat with remaining samosas. Serve warm with either\nMaggi Hot and Sweet chilli sauce\nor chutney, such as\nmint\n,\ncilantro\n, or\ntamarind\n.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nDutch oven\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nrolling pin\n,\nspider skimmer\nNotes\nWhether freshly made, or made in advance and refrigerated, let the samosa filling come to room temperature prior to use (between 68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F, or 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). When too warm, it may melt the dough, and when too cold it may not cook through while frying.\nTake care not to let excess flour get into the oil, or else it will continue to cook and burn, leaving an unpleasant flavor in the oil and samosas alike.\nIf Kashmiri chile powder is unavailable, blend 3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika powder and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder together. Measure out 1/2 teaspoon of this mixture to use as a substitute.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe kheema filling and the samosa wrapper dough can be made up to one day in advance of assembly and frying. Fried samosas can be stored, when completely cool, in a sealed ziptop bag with the air pushed out and placed in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, place in a pre-heated 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) oven, either frozen or thawed, for 20-30 minutes.\nRead More\nHow to Make Your Own Masala Chai\n5 Spices You Need to Start Cooking More Indian Food\nIndian Spiced Chickpea Gravy (Chole)\nPoha Chivda (Indian Flattened Rice Snack)\nSouth Asian\nIndian\nSnacks & Appetizers\nFrying\nGround Lamb"
