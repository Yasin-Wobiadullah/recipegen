Refrigerate the gizzards for 8 hours, or preferably for 24 hours. The gizzards will hold in the buttermilk for up to 2 days.\nWhen you are ready to fry, remove the gizzards from the buttermilk and drain them in a colander. They do not have to be impeccably dry, just drained of the excess buttermilk. Cut the gizzards into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch chunks, working around and discarding any excess sinew or tendon.\nMix the flour with the salt, cayenne pepper, and seasonings. Have the beaten egg ready.\nTo fry: Heat the oil to 350\u00b0F. When ready to fry, dip each piece of gizzard in the egg, and then dredge well in the flour. The gizzards must be coated very well or else the batter will not be crisp.\nSlip the gizzards into the hot oil and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown and crisp. Drain over a rack to get rid of the excess oil. Serve immediately, accompanied by grits and collards for the full Southern experience.\nSouthern Fried Gizzards, Stewed\nPlace the gizzards in a pot with the garlic, onion, carrots, and aromatics. Add enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 40 to 60 minutes, until fork tender.
