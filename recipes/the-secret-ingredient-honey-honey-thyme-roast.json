Take the pork out of the fridge 15 minutes before you want to use it. Pat it dry with a paper towel, and season the pork liberally on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, sear the pork until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes per side, or 12 minutes total. Take the pork out of the pan, and add chicken stock. Scrape up all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan, and reserve the sauce.\nWhile the pork is searing, whisk together the thyme, honey, and butter until completely incorporated. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Carefully rub the mixture all over the outside of the seared pork.\nPlace the honey-ed pork on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet that has been lightly oiled. Use a spoon to pour any of the honey mixture that runs off the meat back on top of the pork loin. Pour the chicken stock from the searing pan into the baking sheet. Roast the pork in the oven until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C). Take the pork out of the oven, tent with foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Slice into medallions, and serve with the pan sauce and a few extra sprigs of fresh thyme.\nRead More\nGingery Roast Pork with Thyme\nEasy Pan-Roasted Pork Tenderloin With Bourbon-Soaked Figs\nSous Vide Pork Tenderloin\nPork Loin\nRoasted Pork\nThyme\nPork Mains"
