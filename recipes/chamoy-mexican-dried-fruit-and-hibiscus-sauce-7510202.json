Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then cover and cook, lowering heat to maintain a simmer, for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer contents of pot to a blender and add lime juice. Starting at the lowest speed and gradually increasing speed to high, blend, stopping to scrape down sides as needed, until a very smooth puree forms. Taste and adjust flavorings and consistency as needed, blending in more salt, sugar, lime juice, and/or water until your desired consistency and flavor are achieved (note the sauce should be boldly salty, tart, sweet, and spicy). Scrape into an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nChamoy can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks.\nMexican\nThe Latest\nGluten-free\nCondiments & Sauces\nVegan"
