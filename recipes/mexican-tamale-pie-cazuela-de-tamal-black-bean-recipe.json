  "full_text": "Tamal de Cazuela (Mexican Tamale Pie) With Black Bean Filling Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n75 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nChilling Time\n45 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 25 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the Masa:\n1\npound\n(\n3\ncups\n)\nmasa harina para tamales\n(see notes)\n3\ncups\nhomemade\nor store-bought\nlow-sodium chicken stock\nor\nwater\n6\nounces\n(\n3/4\ncup\n) cold\nlard\nor\nCrisco\n2\nteaspoons\nkosher salt\n2\nteaspoons\nbaking powder\nFor the Filling (see notes):\n2\nancho chiles\n,\u00a0stemmed and seeded\n1\ncup\nlow-sodium chicken broth\n2\ntablespoons\nlard\nor\nvegetable oil\n1\nmedium\nwhite onion\n, chopped\n3\nmedium\ncloves garlic\n, chopped\n4\ncups\ncooked black beans\n(from\nfour\n15-ounce cans\nor\n2/3\npound\ndried black beans\nsimmered until tender)\nKosher salt\nNonstick cooking spray\nor\nvegetable oil\n, for greasing\nHot sauce\nand\nsalsa verde\n, for serving\nDirections\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine masa harina and broth.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nStir until thoroughly incorporated.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nCombine lard, salt, and baking powder and, using an electric mixer, beat at medium-high speed until lightly whipped, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nAdd 1/4 of the re-hydrated masa at a time to the lard, beating between additions until thoroughly incorporated. The masa should be soft and spreadable, with a hummus-like texture.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nCover masa with plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nMeanwhile, For the Filling:\nMicrowave ancho chiles until fragrant and pliable, 15 to 30 seconds. Transfer to a microwave-safe bowl or measuring cup, add broth, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and microwave on high power until barely simmering, about 3 minutes. Let steep for at least 5 minutes. Using a blender or immersion blender, blend until smooth.\nIn a skillet, heat lard over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add beans and cook until heated through. Using a potato masher, bean masher, or wooden spoon, mash beans to form a chunky pur\u00e9e. Stir in ancho mixture and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nAssembly and Baking:\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Remove masa from refrigerator, discard plastic, and re-whip, adding water one tablespoon at a time, if necessary, to return it to original hummus-like texture. Lightly grease a 12-inch cast iron skillet or 3-quart casserole dish with cooking spray or oil, wiping up any excess.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nScrape 2/3 of masa into skillet and press to form an even thin layer on bottom and edge of pan.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nAdd 2 cups of black bean filling, smoothing to an even layer. Save any remaining filling for another use.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nGently form a top crust with remaining 1/3 masa, binding it with edge.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nWipe any masa residue from rim of skillet. Bake tamale pie until cooked through and lightly golden on top, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool slightly, then slice and serve, passing hot sauce and salsa verde at the table.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nblender\n, 12-inch\ncast iron skillet\nor 3-quart\ncasserole dish\nNotes\nMasa harina para tamales (dried nixtamalized masa flour for tamales) is available at well-stocked grocers in the international or Latin foods aisle.\nAny filling can be used in this pie; just substitute the beans here with two cups of a\nMexican braise\n,\nchili\n, or stewed vegetables. If using a meat, make sure it is shredded or ground, since large chunks of meat won't make an even layer of filling.\nRead More\nQuick and Easy Skillet Tamale Pie With Brown Butter Cornbread Crust\nThe Best Tamale Pie With Braised Skirt Steak, Charred Corn, and Brown Butter Cornbread Crust\nTamales With Red Chili and Chicken Filling\nTamales With Green Chili and Pork\nTamales With Rajas and Oaxacan Cheese\nMexican\nGluten-free Mains\nGluten-free Sides\nSavory\nBlack Beans",
