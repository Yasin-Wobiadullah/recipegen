  "full_text": "Homemade Soy Milk Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nSoaking Time\n8 hrs\nTotal\n8 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n3 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\ndried soybeans\n3 1/2\ncups\nwater\nOptional flavors\nor\nsweeteners\nsuch as\nvanilla\nor\nalmond extract\n;\nhoney\n,\nagave nectar\n, or\nsugar\nDirections\nRinse, drain, and soak beans in about 6 cups of water for 8 to 10 hours. Rinse and drain again.\nTransfer beans into a blender or food processor along with 1 cup of water. Puree, scraping down sides as necessary, until thick and creamy, about 3 minutes.\nSet up a large mixing bowl with a strainer or colander set into it. Line the colander with a large tea towel \u2013 it should be strong but not too thick. You\u2019ll want the soy milk to pass through without letting out any of the soybean pulp.\nTransfer puree plus 2 cups water into a large pot. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scalding, until very foamy and just beginning to boil. Pour the hot puree into the lined strainer and wash out the pot.\nBring the sides of the towel together and twist. Press the contents against the strainer with a pestle or the bottom of a sturdy bottle so that the milk drains out and into the mixing bowl. (A silicone oven mitt can also be used to protect your hands if you want to press the hot sack directly.)\nWhen the soybean pulp seems pretty much dried out, open up the towel and pour in the final 1/2 cup of water over it. Close up the towel again and squeeze out the final drops of soy milk. You should have about 3 1/4 cups of raw soy milk.\nReturn the soy milk to the pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer gently until the milk is sweet and has lost its raw bean flavor, about 7 minutes. Stir in additional flavoring or sweetener, if desired.\nServe warm or cold and consume within a few days.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Fresh Silken Tofu from Soy Milk\nSoy Milk"
