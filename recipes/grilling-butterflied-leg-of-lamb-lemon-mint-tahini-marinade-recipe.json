Place lamb in a large Ziploc bag and pour in marinade. Seal and toss bag to coat the lamb evenly, open and reseal the bag, removing as much air as possible. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate up to overnight. If refrigerated, let lamb return to room temperature before grilling.\nLight one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over the charcoal grate. Clean and oil the cooking grate. Remove the lamb from the marinade and grill until well browned, 12 to 16 minutes; turn and cook 12 to 16 minutes more, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 140\u00b0F in thickest part (for medium rare). Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes.\nWhile lamb is resting, grill lemon slices for garnish. Cut lamb into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Serve with grilled lemon and fresh mint.\nGrilled Lamb\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nLamb Mains",
