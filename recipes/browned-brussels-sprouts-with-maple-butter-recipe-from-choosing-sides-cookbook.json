  "full_text": "Browned Brussels With Maple Butter From 'Choosing Sides'\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n25 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ntablespoons\nextra-virgin olive oil\n2\npounds\nBrussels sprouts\n, stem ends trimmed, outer leaves peeled, and halved (quartered if large)\n1/2\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\n1/4\nteaspoon\nfreshly\nground black pepper\n3\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n2\ntablespoons\npure\nmaple syrup\nDirections\nPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Brush 1 tablespoon of the olive oil on a baking sheet and transfer it to the hot oven for 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, toss the sprouts with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and the salt and pepper. Pour the sprouts out onto the hot baking sheet and spread into a single layer. (Take the time to place each sprout cut side down for especially crisped and browned sprouts.)\nRoast the Brussels sprouts for 15 to 20 minutes, until fork-tender and a dark brown crust forms on the sides exposed to the baking sheet.\nWhile the sprouts roast, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, swirling it around as it becomes liquid. Keep a close eye on the butter as it starts to foam. If you look closely at the liquid butter as it cooks, you can see tiny specks of brown appear (which are the browning milk solids). Continue heating it until it starts to smell nutty and turns from off-white to golden to light brown. Immediately remove from the heat and stir in the maple syrup. Stir briskly as the mixture sizzles and spurts. Set aside in the saucepan until the Brussels finish roasting.\nRemove the Brussels from the oven and transfer to a serving bowl. Drizzle the maple butter all over, tossing to coat evenly. Serve immediately.\nAlongside:\nBacon-crusted Roast Turkey\nApple, Pear, and Sage-stuffed Pork Loin Roulade\nSlow-cooked Chicken and Cippoline\nHerb-stuffed Leg of Lamb\nButternut Ricotta Lasagna\nVegetable Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nRoasted Vegetables\nBrussels Sprouts",
