Cover and set aside for 10 minutes, then drain. Place rehydrated chiles, garlic, shallot, Thai chiles, cilantro, lemongrass, ginger, ground pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in the jar of a blender or food processor. Process until a paste is formed, adding water 1 tablespoon at a time if the mixture is too thick. Season to taste with more salt (the mixture should be quite salty). Curry paste can be made several days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.\nFor the Fish:\nIn a large bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons (45ml) curry paste with 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil, plus lemon juice. Add mint and/or cilantro and whisk to combine. Thin mixture with water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until a chunky but loose texture is achieved. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside. This will be the sauce for the cooked fish.\nIn a large bowl, combine remaining curry paste with remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil. Add fish and turn to coat.\nLight 2/3 chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to medium-high heat, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes.\nClean and oil the grilling grate\n, rubbing several coats of oil onto grates.\nAdd fish to hot side of grill and let cook with the lid down until first side is well marked and fish releases relatively easily when lifted with a thin metal spatula, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn fish and brush or spoon some of sauce on top. Cook on second side until fish is just cooked through and registers 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) at its coolest point on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Fish should show no resistance when a thin metal skewer is inserted, and the flesh should flake easily. Serve immediately, spooning sauce over fish and spreading it over the surface with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle with additional herbs if desired.\nNotes\nOther firm fish fillets, such as salmon, black cod, or grouper, can be used in place of halibut.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nor\nfood processor\n,\ngrill\nand\nchimney starter\n, instant-read thermometer,\nfish spatula\nThis Recipe Appears In\nGrilled Halibut Gets a Thai Makeover With This Red Curry Marinade\nHalibut\nDairy-free Mains\nGrilled Seafood\nSeafood Mains\nQuick Dinners",
