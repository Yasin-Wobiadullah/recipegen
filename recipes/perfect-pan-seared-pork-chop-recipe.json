Season pork chops generously on all sides with all of the sugar. Season with salt to taste. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 24.\nSerious Eats / Lynn Wolsted\nThe next day, preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Place baking sheet with pork chops in oven and cook until an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the chops registers 100 to 110\u00b0F on for medium-rare, about 30 minutes, or 110 to 120\u00b0F for medium, about 35 minutes. To prevent overcooking, start checking temperature 5 to 10 minutes before suggested time. Remove from oven.\nSerious Eats / Lynn Wolsted\nHeat oil in a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place pork chops in skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until starting to brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add butter, shallots, and thyme to skillet. Continue cooking, spooning shallots and thyme on top of chops and basting with butter until golden brown on both sides and well-crusted, about 2 minutes longer. Stack pork chops with tongs, hold them on their sides, and sear the fat caps on the edges until crisp, about a minute. Remove pan from heat, transfer chops to a clean rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Lynn Wolsted\nJust before serving, reheat drippings in pan until smoking. Pour hot drippings over chops. They should sizzle and crisp a bit. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Lynn Wolsted\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\ncast iron\nor\nstainless steel skillet\nPork Chop\nPork Mains"
