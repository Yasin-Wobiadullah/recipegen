Using sharp kitchen shears, remove the backbone by cutting along either side of it. Turn chicken over and lay out flat. Press firmly on breast to flatten the chicken. For added stability, run a metal or wooden skewer horizontally, entering through one thigh, going through both breast halves, and exiting through the other thigh if desired. Tuck wing tips behind back of breasts. Repeat with remaining hens. Split zucchini in half lengthwise.\nCombine salt, pepper, oregano, lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, and olive oil in a small bowl and stir with fingers until homogenous. Rub mixture evenly over all surfaces of hens and zucchini, washing hands in between.\nLight one half chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to medium-high heat.

Cover and continue to cook until golden brown, crisp, charred in spots, and center of breasts registers 145 to 150\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer, about 15 minutes longer. If birds threaten to burn before temperature is achieved, carefully slide to cooler side of grill, cover, and cook until done. Remove birds and zucchini from grill to a cutting board and let rest five minutes.
