Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain simmer. Cook until most of the flavor has been extracted from the dried anchovies (taste one!), about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStrain stock and discard solids. Return stock to pot and bring back to a simmer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nGently shake off any loose starch from the noodles. Place them in a sieve and rinse gently under cold running water, without rubbing, until the excess starch is rinsed off and the water runs clear.\nAdd the noodles, squash, potato, onion, carrot, and garlic to the stock and simmer until vegetables are just tender and noodles are cooked through, about 7 minutes; using chopsticks, gently tease the noodles apart as they cook to ensure they don't clump.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStir in soy sauce, then season further with salt to taste.\nTransfer noodles to warmed bowls. Top with vegetables, then ladle in broth. Garnish each bowl with freshly ground black pepper, if desired, and scallions. Top with any other desired garnishes, including sliced chiles and/or crushed seaweed. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot or\nDutch oven\nNotes\nThere are different kinds of Korean dried anchovies; the ones for stock will be about as big as your thumb. If using a seafood packet, look for ones that contain dried anchovy, shrimp, and kelp (some dried radish and mushroom in the mix is fine, too).\nReady-made knife-cut noodles are long, white wheat noodles that you can find in Korean grocery stores with the label \"\uce7c\uad6d\uc218\" in the refrigerated section; they are pre-portioned into twisted bunches.\nJoseon ganjang is made only from soybeans with no wheat; check the ingredient label, as ones with wheat will make the soup too sweet.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup is best eaten shortly after cooking.\nSoups\nKorean\nStovetop\nNoodles\nAnchovies",
