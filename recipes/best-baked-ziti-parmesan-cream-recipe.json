Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.\nScrape into baking dish and press into an even layer.\nDrizzle remaining 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce all over top of pasta.\nScatter remaining 1 cup mozzarella all over, cover with aluminum foil, and bake for 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a medium saucepan, gently simmer cream over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle in Parmigiano-Reggiano into cream and whisk until completely melted and sauce is smooth. Season with salt. Keep warm.\nIncrease oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C), uncover baked ziti, and cook until just starting to brown on top, about 10 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. Top with basil leaves, spoon onto plates, and drizzle with Parmesan cream.
