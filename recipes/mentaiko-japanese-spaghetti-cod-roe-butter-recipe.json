Reserve 2 teaspoons (10g) roe for garnish and place the rest in a large heatproof bowl. Add soy sauce to bowl with roe and stir to combine.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen spaghetti is cooked, transfer to bowl with roe using tongs. Add 1/4 cup (60ml) pasta-cooking water and butter, 2 pieces at a time, and stir and toss pasta until butter is melted and forms sauce. Continue to stir and toss pasta until evenly coated in sauce, any excess liquid has been absorbed, and a smooth, creamy sauce has formed. Transfer to individual serving bowls, top each bowl with reserved roe, and garnish with nori strips. Serve right away, mixing nori and roe garnish in with chopsticks before eating.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nMentaiko is spicy cured pollack roe, available at Japanese markets (sometimes in the freezer section). Make sure not to get the similar tarako, which is only salted and not spiced, as the flavor won't be quite right.\nRead More\nDoes Adding Pasta Water Really Make a Difference?\nBottarga: What It Is, How to Use It, and Whether It's Worth It\nPasta con la Bottarga (Pasta With Bottarga)\nIkura Don (Japanese Rice Bowl With Salmon Roe)\nPasta Mains\nJapanese\nStovetop Pasta\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine\nSeafood",
