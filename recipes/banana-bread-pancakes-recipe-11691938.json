Cook, stirring often, until butter solids turn golden brown and smell nutty, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and whisk in cinnamon. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.\nPour butter over banana mixture and whisk to combine. Add buttermilk and whisk to incorporate. Add flour mixture, whisking until just combined. Using a flexible spatula, fold in walnuts, if using.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nPlace a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet; set aside.\nHeat a large electric nonstick griddle to medium heat (350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C) or large nonstick, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet or stovetop griddle over medium heat. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter and, using a 1/3 cup scoop or measuring cup, scoop batter onto griddle or skillet to form 3-inch pancakes spaced 1/2- to 1-inch apart, working in batches if necessary. Cook until bubbles start to appear on top of batter and bottoms are golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to prevent overbrowning. Carefully flip pancakes and cook until bottoms are lightly golden and pancakes are cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm with maple syrup.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nSmall saucepan;\nwhisk\n; flexible spatula; wire rack; rimmed baking sheet; nonstick electric\ngriddle\nor large nonstick, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet or stovetop griddle\nNotes\nButtermilk can be substituted with a mixture of milk and vinegar. In a measuring cup, stir 1/2 cup whole milk with 1 teaspoon white vinegar or apple cider vinegar to combine. Let sit 5 minutes and proceed with recipe.\nThe recipe can be doubled.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce cooled, pancakes can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat in the microwave or a 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) oven until warmed through.\nBanana\nThe Latest\nBreakfast & Brunch\nPancakes",
