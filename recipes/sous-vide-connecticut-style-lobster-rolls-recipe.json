Add hot dog buns, with exposed crumbs down, and griddle until golden brown. Flip and griddle second side. Transfer to a serving platter.\nDiscard any herbs from sous vide lobster bag. Remove lobster meat from bag and chop into large bite-size pieces. Transfer to a large bowl and add butter and juices from bag. Season with lemon juice to taste. Add chives and toss to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. (Sous vide lobster is typically well seasoned even without additional salt.) Divide mixture evenly between hot dog buns and serve.\nNotes\nTop-split buns are not widely available outside of New England. If you can't find them, you can use regular hot dog buns with the crust along the sides very carefully sliced off, to expose the soft interior crumb for toasting.\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion circulator\nRead More\nSous Vide Lobster Recipe\nSous Vide Maine-Style Lobster Rolls (With Mayonnaise) Recipe\nConnecticut-Style Warm Buttered Lobster Rolls Recipe\nThe Ultimate Lobster, Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado, and Tomato Sandwiches Recipe\nHow To Buy A Lobster\nLobster\nNew England\nSous Vide Seafood\nSandwiches",
