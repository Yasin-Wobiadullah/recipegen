  "full_text": "Roasted and Reverse Seared Prime Rib\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n4 hrs 40 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nResting Time\n30 mins\nTotal\n5 hrs 20 mins\nServes\n3\nto 12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nstanding rib roast\n(\nprime rib\n),\n3 to 12\npounds\n(\n1.3 to 5.4\nkg\n; see note)\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\nDirections\nPreheat oven to lowest possible temperature setting, 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) or higher if necessary. (Some ovens cannot hold a temperature below 250\u00b0F/121\u00b0C.) Season roast generously with salt and pepper. Place roast, with fat cap up, on a V-rack set in a large roasting pan, or on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Place in oven and cook until center of roast registers 120-125\u00b0F (49-52\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer for rare, 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium-rare, or 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for medium to medium-well. In a 150\u00b0F oven, this will take around 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours; in a 250\u00b0F oven, this will take 3 1/2 to 4 hours.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nRemove roast from oven and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Place in a warm spot in the kitchen and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat oven to highest possible temperature setting, 500 to 550\u00b0F (260 to 288\u00b0C).\nTen minutes before guests are ready to be served, remove foil, place roast back in hot oven, and cook until well-browned and crisp on the exterior, 6 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, carve, and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nRoasting pan with V-rack\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nThis recipe works for prime rib roasts of any size from two ribs to six ribs. Plan on one pound of bone-in roast per guest. (Each rib adds one and a half to two pounds to the roast.) For best results, use a dry-aged prime-grade or grass-fed roast.\nTo improve the crust, allow the roast to air-dry, uncovered, on a rack in the refrigerator overnight before roasting. Seasoning with salt up to a day in advance will help the seasoning penetrate the meat more deeply. If, after step 1, your timing is off, and your roast is ready long before your guests are, reheat the roast by placing it in a 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C) oven for 45 minutes before you continue with step 2.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's Definitive Guide to Prime Rib\nSerious Entertaining: A Blowout Christmas Dinner\nRoasted Beef\nRoasting\nChristmas Dinners\nThanksgiving Dinner\nWinter Mains"
