In a medium or large pot of salted boiling water and working in batches, cook broccoli florets until just barely softened and bright green, 1 minute. Using a strainer, transfer immediately to ice bath and repeat with remaining broccoli florets.\nOnce broccoli is fully chilled, drain very well.\nMeanwhile, in a blender, combine 1/4 cup (1/2 ounce; 15g) of the toasted pistachios with vinegar, Dijon, garlic, and vegetable oil. Blend at high speed, stopping to scrape down the blender jar sides if necessary, until pistachios are mostly pureed with only some small chunks left. Add basil leaves and blend until finely chopped. Add olive oil and blend at the slowest speed until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.\nLightly crush or chop remaining pistachios. In a large salad bowl, combine drained broccoli florets, broccoli stems, crushed pistachios, radicchio, and a generous shaving of Parmesan cheese. Stir dressing well (or mix it briefly in the blender at slow speed to stir), then add just enough to lightly coat all the salad ingredients. Toss well and season with salt and pepper. If more dressing is needed, add more. Top with more fresh shavings of Parmesan and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nBlender\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFor Better Broccoli Salad, Cook the Florets\nGluten-free Salads\nVegetarian Salads\nStovetop Vegetables\nPistachios\nBroccoli"
