Shape beef into 4 (1-inch-thick) patties, about 3 inches in diameter. Press your thumb into center of each patty to create an indention (about 1/2-inch deep).\nSerious Eats / Loco Moco\nIn a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high until just smoking. Sprinkle both sides of patties with salt and pepper. Transfer patties to skillet, and cook, flipping once, until browned on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer patties to a plate. Reserve 2 teaspoons drippings in skillet, and discard any remaining drippings.\nSerious Eats / Loco Moco\nFor the Gravy:\nAdd onion to the drippings in skillet and cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, 5 to 6 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Loco Moco\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl whisk together beef stock, cornstarch, soy sauce, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, and salt until combined. Add stock mixture to skillet with softened onion, and bring to a boil over medium. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring continuously, until gravy thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Add beef patties to gravy in skillet; simmer for 1 more minute until heated through, spooning gravy over patties to warm through. Season to taste with salt, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Loco Moco\nTo Serve:\nDivide rice onto 4 plates. Center a hamburger patty on top of rice on each plate. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of gravy over each patty and top with a fried egg. Spoon 1/2 cup gravy around rice on each plate. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Loco Moco\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nLeftovers can be stored in an airtight container for up to 4 days.\nComfort Food\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nMains\nGround Beef"
