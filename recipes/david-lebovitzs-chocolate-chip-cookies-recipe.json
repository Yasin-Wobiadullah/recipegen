Beat in the eggs one at a time until thoroughly incorporated, then stir in the flour mixture followed by the nuts and chocolate chunks.\nOn a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough into quarters. Shape each quarter into a log about 9 inches (23 cm) long. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, preferably for 24 hours.\nPosition racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\nSlice the logs into disks 3/4 inch (2 cm) thick and place the disks 3 inches (8 cm) apart on the prepared baking sheets. If the nuts or chips crumble out, simply push them back in.\nBake, rotating the baking sheets midway through baking, until the cookies are very lightly browned in the centers, about 10 minutes. If you like soft chocolate chip cookies, as I do, err on the side of underbaking.\nLet the cookies cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to handle, then use a spatula to transfer them to a wire rack.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dough logs can be refrigerated for 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month. The baked cookies will keep well in an airtight container for up to 4 days.\nCookies\nBaking\nChocolate"
