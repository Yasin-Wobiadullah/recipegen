Line bottom and two sides of an 8- by 8- by 2-inch baking pan with foil, allowing edges to hang over the side.\nMake caramel:\nHeat sugar, 1/2 cup water, and honey in heavy duty saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring, until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to boil. Stop stirring and brush down sides of pan with water. Cook until color resembles maple syrup (see note).\nRemove from heat and immediately add butter, heavy cream, and 1/8 teaspoon salt, whisking until combined (see note). Set aside to cool completely.\nAs the caramel is cooling, make the crust. Pulse flour, brown sugar, pinch salt, and butter until moist crumbs form. Press into bottom of prepared pan and bake until light golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool, about 30 minutes.\nScatter pecans, chocolate, and Twix bars over the crust. Measure out 1/2 caramel and reserve. Stir condensed milk and vanilla into remaining caramel. Pour over crust. Spoon 8 teaspoons of the reserved caramel into filling (use leftover caramel for another use).\nBake until mixture is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack to cool completely, about 3 hours. If bars are not set at room temperature, chill to firm. Lift bars from pan and cut into 12 pieces.\nSpecial Equipment\n8- by 8- by 2-inch baking pan, aluminum foil\nNotes\nBrushing down the sides of the pan will help prevent the caramel from crystallizing. If one area of the pan begins to brown more quickly, gently swirl the pan to evenly distribute the caramel. Take care when adding the butter and cream to the caramel as it may sputter.\nDessert Bars\nChocolate\nCookies",
