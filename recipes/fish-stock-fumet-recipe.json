Stir in kosher salt until dissolved. Let stand 1 hour. Drain, then rinse fish under cold running water, washing away any large areas of blood, such as near spine (see notes).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion, fennel, leek, celery, and garlic, and cook, stirring, until vegetables have softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in fish heads and bones. Add wine and cook, stirring, until it begins to steam. Add 4 cups water (liquid should just barely cover heads and bones; if not, add just enough more to barely cover). Add parsley, tarragon, bay leaf, and peppercorns.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBring liquid to a bare simmer, then lower heat so that it stays just below a simmer, with only the occasional bubble. Cook for 20 minutes. Using a spoon, skim off any scum that accumulates on the surface.\nStrain fish stock through a fine-mesh strainer, then chill. Fish stock can be kept refrigerated, covered, for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nSoaking and washing the fish bones and heads helps create a more delicate stock, but don't drive yourself crazy. Our tests showed that removing blood has a subtle effect\u2014enough to make it worth doing, but not worth being obsessive about.\nFish\nStovetop Seafood"
