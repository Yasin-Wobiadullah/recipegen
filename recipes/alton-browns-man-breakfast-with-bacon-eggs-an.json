Cook, flipping occasionally, until the slices are cooked to your liking. Turn down the heat if they are cooking too quickly. When done, drain the bacon on some paper towels and set aside.\nRemove all but two tablespoons of the bacon fat, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Grate the potatoes on the largest holes of a box grater. Add the potatoes to the skillet and spread out evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle with a couple pinches of salt. Let the potatoes cook undisturbed for five minutes. Flip the potatoes with a spatula, reduce heat to low, and cook for an additional five minutes.\nFor the eggs: With five minutes left with the potatoes, add the butter to a non-stick skillet set over low heat. When the butter foams, carefully crack in the four eggs. (Brown suggests cracking the eggs into a custard cup, and then adding them in.) Season with salt and pepper, and then cover the skillet. Cook until the whites are set but the yolk is still runny, three to five minutes.\nWhen the eggs are done, use a spatula place two eggs on two separate plates. On each plate, add half of the hash browns and bacon. Serve immediately.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nStovetop\nEggs\nBacon\nRusset Potatoes",
