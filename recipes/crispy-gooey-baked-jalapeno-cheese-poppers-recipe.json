Transfer cheeses to a medium saucepan and add evaporated milk and hot sauce. Place over low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until melted and thickened, about 5 minutes. Let stand until cooled to room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nArrange jalape\u00f1o rings on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spoon cheese sauce into jalape\u00f1o rings, filling about 2/3 full and patting down with fingers.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nPlace cornflakes and breadcrumbs in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until cornflakes are finely processed. Transfer breading mixture to a shallow bowl.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nPlace buttermilk, flour, and eggs in separate shallow bowls. Working one at a time, dunk a jalape\u00f1o slice into buttermilk and then roll around in flour until completely coated. Dunk jalape\u00f1o slice into eggs and then roll around in breadcrumb mixture until completely coated. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with all jalape\u00f1o rings. Transfer baking sheet to freezer and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Remove baking sheet from freezer. Brush breaded jalape\u00f1os all over with bacon fat or oil. Transfer baking sheet to oven and cook until cheese is heated throughout and outsides are browned and crisp, 15-18 minutes. Remove from oven and transfer jalape\u00f1o poppers to a tray. Season with salt. Serve immediately with sauce of your choice.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nwire rack\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe stuffed and breaded jalape\u00f1o slices can be frozen on a baking sheet, then transferred to a zipper-lock bag and kept frozen for up to 3 months.
