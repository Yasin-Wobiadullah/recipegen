Add beef and cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Add ramp whites and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ginger and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add chile bean paste, wine, soy sauce, and chicken stock and bring to a boil. Pour in corn starch mixture and cook for 30 seconds until thickened. Add tofu and carefully fold in, being careful not to break it up too much. Stir in chile oil and half of ramp greens and simmer for 30 seconds longer. Transfer immediately to a serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining ramp greens and toasted ground Sichuan pepper. Serve immediately with white rice.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nNotes\nBoth the chile bean paste and the Sichuan peppercorns can be bought online if you don't have a good Chinese market nearby. Use tofu labeled \"silken\" in a hardness range of medium to firm. Don't try this with the super-soft stuff or it'll fall apart!\nYou can use store-bought roasted chile oil, or make your own by toasting a cup of whole hot dried Chinese peppers in a wok until lightly charred, then adding 1 1/2 cups of vegetable or canola oil. Heat the oil until the chilis start to bubble slightly, then allow to cool and transfer to a sealable container. Chili oil will stay good in the refrigerator for several months.\nRead More\nReal-Deal Mapo Tofu Recipe\nThe Best Vegan Mapo Tofu Recipe\n11 Ramp Recipes to Celebrate Ramp Season\nTofu\nChinese\nDairy-free Mains\nStovetop Tofu\nGround Beef"
