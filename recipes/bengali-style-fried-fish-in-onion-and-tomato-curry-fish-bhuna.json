In a small bowl, combine kosher salt, turmeric, and 2 teaspoons (4g) Kashmiri red chili powder. Sprinkle salt mixture all over fish.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd enough oil to a large saut\u00e9 pan to fill it 1/4 inch deep and heat over high heat until shimmering. Working in batches if needed, add seasoned fish steaks and cook until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spatula, transfer cooked steaks to a plate, tray, or dish and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDrain off all but 2 tablespoons oil from saut\u00e9 pan. Continuing to work over high heat, add onion and cook until browned in spots, about 5 minutes; lower heat at any point if onion threatens to burn.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLower heat to medium and add ginger, bay leaf, remaining 1 teaspoon (2g) chili powder, cumin, and coriander, cooking until the spices bloom, about 3 minutes. Add diced tomatoes and cook until some of the liquid has cooked off and you have a thick, paste-like curry, about 5 minutes. Finish the gravy with vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNestle the fried fish steaks into the curry, gently tossing to coat in the sauce. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nChef's knife, stainless steel saut\u00e9 pan\nNotes\nIf you don't have dorade, any other fish can work well in this dish as long as it's cut into steaks. Keeping the fish bone-in prevents it from drying out in this two-step cooking process. Good substitutes for dorade include catfish, snapper, and striped bass. You can ask your fishmonger to clean, scale, and cut the fish into steaks if you don't want to do it yourself (but keep the heads\u2014they're a delicious snack once fried).\nFish\nSouth Asian\nGluten-free Mains\nFried Seafood\nOnions",
