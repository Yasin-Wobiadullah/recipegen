  "full_text": "Creamy Eggless Chocolate Frosting\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nCooling Time\n60 mins\nTotal\n115 mins\nServes\n40 servings\nMakes\n5 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n7 ounces plain or\ntoasted\nsugar\n(\n200\ng\n; 1 cup)\n2 ounces\nDutch cocoa powder\n, such as Cacao Barry Extra Brute (about 2/3 cup, spooned;\n55\ng\n; about 2/3 cup); see notes\n1/4\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use about half as much by volume\n32\nfluid ounces\nmilk\n,\nany percentage will do\n(\n946\nml\n; 4 cups)\n6\nfluid\nounces\nheavy cream\n(170g; 3/4 cup)\n12\nounces\nunsalted butter\n(340g; about 3 sticks), softened to about 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C)\nDirections\nFor the Base:\nIn a 5-quart stainless steel or enameled Dutch oven, whisk sugar, Dutch cocoa, and salt to combine. Whisk in milk and cream to combine. If you have a scale, weigh the pot and ingredients together so you can digitally track the reduction. Place over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a heat-resistant spatula, until milk begins to simmer, about 12 minutes. (If this takes substantially more or less time, adjust the heat accordingly to better match the pace of the cooking process in step 2.)\nSimmer, using a heat-proof flexible spatula to stir and scrape continuously to prevent a milky buildup from forming around the sides or scorching along the bottom, until mixture is as thick and dark as chocolate pudding and reduced to about 2 1/3 cups (24 ounces), about 30 minutes. Again, if this process is moving too slowly or too rapidly, simply adjust the heat. If you're using a scale, the pot will weigh 25 ounces less than when you started. Transfer to a wide dish (such as a 7- by 11-inch baking dish), cover with plastic, and refrigerate until thick and cold, or approximately 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), about 1 hour.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat chilled cocoa base until smooth, then add softened butter a few tablespoons at a time. When ingredients are well combined, switch to a whisk attachment and beat until frosting is creamy, smooth, and light. The frosting's ideal working temperature is about 70\u00b0F. If its temperature is significantly below that, the frosting may seem greasy or curdled; significantly above, and it may seem soft and loose. Its consistency can be adjusted according to the\nbuttercream troubleshooting guide here\n.\nSpecial equipment\nStainless steel pot or\nenameled Dutch oven\n, heat-proof flexible spatula,\nstand mixer\nNotes\nThe flavor of this frosting hinges on high-quality Dutch cocoa powder, so don't expect good results from low-fat brands. Look for those with a minimum of 20% fat. (You can use the nutrition label for some rough math, dividing the grams of fat per serving by the grams per serving.) My go-tos are Cacao Barry Extra Brute and Valrhona, but supermarket options like Droste work well, too. Check out my complete list of recommended Dutch cocoas for more information.\nChocolate\nDesserts",
