Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nFor the Fish:\nIn a medium bowl or shallow baking dish, whisk together flour, cornmeal, and Creole seasoning. In a second medium bowl or shallow baking dish, whisk together eggs and 1/3 cup flour mixture. The mixture should have the consistency of thick pancake batter. Adjust consistency with additional flour mixture if necessary. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet.\nWorking in batches, place fish fillets in flour mixture and toss to evenly coat. Shake off excess flour; transfer fish to egg mixture and turn to thoroughly coat. Allow excess batter to drip back into bowl, and then return fish to flour mixture. Press gently in flour mixture to help coating adhere; transfer to prepared wire rack. Repeat dredging process with remaining fillets. Refrigerate fish for 15 minutes.\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Carefully add half the fish to the oil and cook, stirring occasionally with a spider skimmer, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked fish to second wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Season with salt to taste. Repeat with remaining fillets.\nFor Serving:\nOpen rolls and spread cut sides with r\u00e9moulade. Divide lettuce, tomatoes, pickle chips, and fish evenly among rolls. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nWire rack\n,\nLarge Dutch oven\n,\nInstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nIf you can find French-style po' boy rolls or Vietnamese baguettes used for banh mi sandwiches, use them. Otherwise, use regular sub or hoagie rolls. If the interior of the bread is very dense, scoop most of it out and discard it before building your po' boys.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nR\u00e9moulade can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Po' boys are best enjoyed right away.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make the Best Seafood Po' Boys\nSandwiches\nCajun & Creole\nFrying\nCatfish\nQuick Dinners"
