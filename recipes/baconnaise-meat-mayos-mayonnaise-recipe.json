Whisk to combine.\nAdd egg yolks, Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, and water to bowl of food processor (see note). Run processor for 5 seconds to combine. Scrape down sides of processor bowl with rubber spatula. With processor running, slowly drizzle fat into bowl in a thin, steady stream, stopping and scraping down sides as necessary. Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste, and adjust consistency with water until thick, smooth, and creamy, but not mouth-coatingly waxy. Stir in cumbled bacon bits and sliced scallions, if using. Store in refrigerator in air-tight container for up to two weeks.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nNotes\nThis mayonnaise can be made with vegetable oil in place of the rendered animal fat - though flavor will suffer.\nFor insurance, I add jarred mayonnaise to the food processor at the start, which makes it easier to create a stable emulsion. If you are an experienced mayonnaise-maker who has no problems with mayonnaise breaking on you, you may omit the jarred mayonnaise.\nThe mayonnaise can also be made in a bowl with a whisk.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStore in refrigerator in an air-tight container for up to two weeks.\nRead More\nGarlic Beefonnaise Recipe\nSpicy Duckonnaise Recipe\nSpicy 'Nduja Mayonnaise Recipe\nTwo-Minute Mayonnaise Recipe\nThe Food Lab Video Series: Emulsions\nHow to Fix a Broken Sauce or Vinaigrette\nCondiments & Sauces\nBacon",
