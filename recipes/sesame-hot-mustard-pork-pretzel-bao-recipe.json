Add pork and toss to cover with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight, turning at least once.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a rack on top. Remove the pork from the marinade and place on the rack. Roast until pork reaches 135\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer when inserted in the center, about 40 minutes.\nMeanwhile, For the Glaze:\nIn a small bowl, mix together honey and water for the glaze. Brush the pork with the glaze and set the oven to broil. Broil the pork, turning, until charred all over, about 5 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes.\nFor the Sauce:\nCombine all sauce ingredients in a bowl and set aside.\nCut roasted pork into small pieces and mix in a large bowl with the sauce. Refrigerate until ready to stuff.\nFor the\nTangzhong\n:\nIn a small saucepan over medium-low heat, mix together the water and bread flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick and lightly golden. Remove from heat and transfer the tangzhong to a small container. Cover with plastic and chill for at least 1 hour.\nFor the Dough:\nWarm 1/2 cup of milk and pour in the yeast. Let stand until frothy, about 10 minutes. Combine the yeast-milk mixture, the Tangzhong, and the remaining dough ingredients in a large bowl, and stir until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Remove from the bowl and knead on a lightly floured work surface until stretchy, about 10 minutes longer. Spray the dough all over with nonstick spray and return to the bowl. Place plastic wrap directly on top of the dough to prevent it from drying out and set in a warm, draft free area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nRemove the dough from the bowl and divide into 16 even pieces. Roll the pieces into balls. Using the palm of your hand, press down each dough ball until flat. Place 2 tablespoons of filling on the center of each round. Pull up the edges and pinch together to seal. Transfer the filled buns, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Re-cover with the coated plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour.\nFor the Alkaline Solution:\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups of hot water and baked baking soda. Dunk the tops of the stuffed buns into the baking-soda solution for 1 minute each and then return to the tray, dipped side up.\nFor Topping the Buns:\nIn a small bowl, beat the egg with the water. Brush the buns with the egg mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds and salt, to your preference. Using a sharp knife or pair of kitchen shears, slice the very tops of the buns, making sure not to pierce through to the filling. Bake until browned, about 20 minutes, turning halfway through.\nServe warm.\nNotes\nRegular baking soda will work as well if preferred, but for darker, more authentic-tasting pretzels, baked baking soda works best. To make baked baking soda, spread baking soda on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 300\u00b0F for 1 hour.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nDim Sum Goes Deutsch: Pretzel Bao With Hot Mustard Pork Filling\nSnacks & Appetizers\nChinese\nPork",
