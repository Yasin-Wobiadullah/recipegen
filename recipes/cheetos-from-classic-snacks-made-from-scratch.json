Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the flour, cornmeal, and shredded cheese. Stir together at low speed until a firm dough forms. Shape into a disc and place on a large sheet of plastic wrap; wrap tightly and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat liners.\nPinch off small pieces of the chilled dough and gently roll between your palms and fingers to form lumpy logs roughly 2- to 2-1/2-inches long and 1/4- to 1/2- inch across. Place on the prepared baking sheets\u2014you can space them fairly close together because they won't puff up while baking.\nBake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the pieces are no longer shiny and are just beginning to brown around the edges. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.\nAdd the coating:\nPlace the cheese powder, buttermilk powder, salt, and cornstarch in a spice grinder or mini food processor and whir for 10 to 15 seconds to blend evenly.\nTransfer to a large zip-top bag. Add the cooled Cheetos, seal, and shake gently to coat evenly. Store the coated cheese curls at room temperature in an airtight container for up to a week.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nCheese",
