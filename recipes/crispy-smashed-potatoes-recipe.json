  "full_text": "Crispy Smashed Potatoes Recipe\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n70 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nCooling Time\n10 mins\nTotal\n100 mins\nServes\n8\nto 10 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\npounds\nsmall red\nor\nYukon gold potatoes\nKosher salt\n1/2\ncup\nvegetable oil\n, plus more as needed (see note)\nFreshly\u00a0ground black pepper\n1/4\ncup\nsliced\nchives\n,\nparsley\n, or\ntarragon\n(optional)\nDirections\nPlace potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Season heavily with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until potatoes are completely tender, about 10 minutes after a boil is achieved (poke a potato with a sharp knife or cake tester to test for doneness). Drain in a colander set in the sink and let rest for 10 minutes to dry and cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nWorking one potato at a time, place potato on cutting board and smash firmly with the bottom of a heavy skillet to a thickness of about 1/2-inch thick. Transfer to a large plate or tray as you work.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nHeat 1/2 cup oil in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add as many potatoes as will fit in a single layer. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bottom side is deep golden brown, about 6 minutes. Carefully flip with a thin metal spatula and cook until second side is golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and allow to drain.\nSerious eats / Eric Kleinberg\nContinue cooking potatoes in batches, adding more oil or fat as necessary, until all potatoes are cooked. Potatoes can then be left aside until ready to serve.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nTo serve, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Spread potatoes over to large rimmed baking sheets. Transfer to oven and cook until heated through, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, season to taste with salt and pepper, add herbs (if using), toss to distribute, transfer to a serving platter, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron skillet\nNotes\nDuck fat will make for even tastier, crispier potatoes.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPotatoes can be fully cooked a day ahead. Refrigerate overnight and re-crisp in the oven.\nRoasted Potatoes\nPotatoes\nRed Potatoes\nYukon Gold Potatoes\nFall Sides"
