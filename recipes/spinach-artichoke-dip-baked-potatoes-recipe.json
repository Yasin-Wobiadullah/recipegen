Using a fork or paring knife, puncture potatoes in several spots. Rub each potato with a light coat of oil. Arrange on a rack set on a baking sheet, or directly on an oven rack, and bake until a fork can easily be inserted into the center of each potato, about 1 hour. If setting potatoes directly on oven rack, set a sheet of foil on the rack below to catch any oil drips.\nIf Using the Microwave and Oven:\nPreheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Using a fork or paring knife, puncture potatoes in several spots. Microwave potatoes for 5 minutes. Rub each potato with a light coat of oil. Arrange on a rack set on a baking sheet, or directly on an oven rack, and bake until a fork can easily be inserted into the center of each potato, about 20 minutes. If setting potatoes directly on oven rack, set a sheet of foil on the rack below to catch any oil drips.\nLet potatoes rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, stir together sour cream, cream cheese, parmesan cheese, shallot, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Slice each potato open lengthwise and carefully scoop flesh into the mixing bowl with the dip base. Mash the potatoes with a fork while mixing with the other ingredients, then fold in mozzarella cheese, artichokes, and spinach.\nScoop potato mixture back into the baked potato skins and shape back into the classic baked potato shape. Return to oven and cook until the cheese has melted and begun to brown in spots, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.\nSpecial equipment\nRimmed baking sheet,\nbaking rack\nNotes\nBaking the potatoes in the oven produces only marginally better results, but takes longer. The microwave speeds things up.\nVegetarian Sides\nRoasted Potatoes\nCheese\nArtichoke\nSpinach",
