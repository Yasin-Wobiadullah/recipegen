Transfer breadcrumbs to a small bowl, and season lightly with salt. Set aside.\nIn a Dutch oven or medium pot, bring 3 quarts of water and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil over high heat. Add spaghetti to water and cook, stirring frequently during the first minute to prevent pasta from sticking. Cook pasta until al dente.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in a very large bowl, combine colatura, garlic, and pepper flakes. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil, followed by 2 tablespoons (30ml) pasta water, to form an emulsion.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer pasta to bowl along with another 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta water and parsley. Vigorously toss and stir pasta to emulsify sauce and coat with noodles. Add breadcrumbs and toss to combine. Pasta should be well-coated with creamy, emulsified sauce. If it seems dry, add extra pasta water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd lemon zest and taste pasta for seasoning, adding a final splash of colatura if needed. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven\n,\nwhisk\nNotes\nThe success of this recipe hinges upon the unique flavor of colatura, an Italian fish sauce made in the Amalfitano town of Cetara. Colatura tastes very different from high-quality Southeast Asian fish sauce, and unfortunately, one cannot be substituted for the other. If you don't want to spring for Colatura, I would recommend making the sister dish to this pasta instead,\nspaghetti aglio e olio\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis quick and easy dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nColatura di Alici: What It Is, Why It's Worth It, and How to Use It\nSpaghetti Aglio e Olio (Pasta in Garlic and Oil Sauce)\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nStovetop Pasta\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine\nAnchovies",
