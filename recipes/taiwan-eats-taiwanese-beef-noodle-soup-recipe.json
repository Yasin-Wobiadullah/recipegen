Add the beef and cook without moving until well browned on first side, about 4 minutes. Stir and cook until well browned all over, about 10 minutes total. Transfer beef to a large bowl and repeat with 1 more tablespoon oil and remaining beef.\nAdd remaining tablespoon of oil to the same pan and heat until shimmering. Add the sliced ginger, garlic cloves, and chilies. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the chopped tomato and stir stir for another minute. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved, about 30 seconds. Add the chili bean sauce, and stir until the mixture just begins to bubble.\nReturn the beef to the pot. Stir to warm up and coat the meat with the spices. Add the rice wine and cook for 1 minute, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot. Add the star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and the water. Bring to a boil. Then reduce heat to a simmer and cover. Cook until beef is tender, about 2 1/2 hours.\nUsing tongs, carefully remove the beef cubes from the stew and set aside in a bowl. Carefully strain the soup over a colander or mesh strainer to catch the ginger, peppercorns, and other stray solids. Retain any solids or small beef pieces from the strained mixture that you may want to keep, and return to the soup. Return the beef to the soup and add greens to wilt if desired.\nCook the noodles according to the directions on their package. Strain noodles, and divide into serving bowls. Ladle the warm soup and beef chunks into each bowl and serve immediately.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nTaiwan Eats: Beef Noodle Soup\nChinese Noodles 101: The Chinese Egg Noodle Style Guide\nEast Asian\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nBeef Chuck\nNoodles\nComfort Food"
