Add chicken and set over medium-high heat until water temperature registers between 150 and 160\u00b0F (65.5 to 71\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer; adjust heat to maintain water temperature in the 150\u2013160\u00b0F range. (It's okay if the temperature bounces around a little, but try to keep it above 150 and below 170\u00b0F.) Cook until thickest part of chicken registers 150\u00b0F (65.5\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove chicken and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Using two forks or clean hands, shred chicken into bite-size pieces and set aside.\nVicky Wasik\nIn a large bowl, stir together mayonnaise, pesto, and lemon juice until well combined. Add reserved shredded chicken and sun-dried tomatoes and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge saucepan,\ninstant-read thermometer\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nIf using homemade pesto, the pesto can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days with a thin layer of extra-virgin olive oil on top to prevent pesto from oxidizing. The finished chicken salad can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nChicken Salad\nThe Latest\nPoached Chicken\nPesto"
