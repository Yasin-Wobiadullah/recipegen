Line bottom with parchment paper; coat once again with baking spray. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.\nIn medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Cook butter, swirling pan occasionally, until beginning to foam; as foam settles, brown bits will begin to settle at bottom of saucepan; remove butter from heat and pour into a large bowl when browning has slowed, 12 to 15 minutes total. Transfer butter to large bowl and refrigerate until solid, 45 to 60 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl; reserve. Combine milk and vanilla in liquid measuring cup; reserve.\nWith an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat chilled browned butter and sugar in large bowl on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Decrease speed to low and add flour mixture in three additions, alternating with milk mixture. Scrape bottom and sides of bowl as necessary.\nScrape batter into prepared pan. Bake until tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.

Cool completely, about 1 hour.\nFor the Caramel:\nIn medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat.
