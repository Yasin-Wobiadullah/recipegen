Add water to pot to just cover chicken (about 10 cups). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then reduce heat to simmer. Cook until chicken is tender and falling off the bone, about 1 hour.\nWhile broth is simmering, make dumpling dough: In a medium bowl, stir flour with 2 tablespoons butter, shortening, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, mashing with a fork until mixture resembles coarse wet crumbs. Stir in milk until it forms a dough. Let sit about 20 minutes.\nWhen cooked, transfer chicken to plate. Strain stock and return to saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat until reduced to 6 cups. Skim fat from the top and season to taste with salt and ground pepper; keep warm. When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones and shred into bite-size pieces; reserve.\nOn floured surface, roll dough into a rough 10- by 10-inch square about a quarter inch thick. Cut dough into 1 1/2-inch wide strips, then cut each strip into 1 1/2-inch squares.\nReturn broth to simmer over medium heat. Add dumplings to broth, one at a time. Cover and simmer until dumplings have puffed slightly and are cooked through, stirring gently once or twice to make sure that they don't stick to each other. Return chicken to pot to heat through. Stir in 1/3 cup parsley leaves, lemon juice, nutmeg (if using), and serve.\nRead More\nTurkey 'n' Dumplings\nChicken and Dumplings From 'Lighten Up, America!'\nThe Best Matzo Ball Soup\nMasa Ball Soup (Corn Dumplings in Chicken Soup)\nEinat Admony's Chicken Soup With Gondi (Iranian Chicken and Chickpea Dumplings)\nSoups\nStovetop Chicken\nWhole Chicken"
