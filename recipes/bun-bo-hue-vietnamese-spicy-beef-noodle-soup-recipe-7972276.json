Let soak at room temperature for 30 minutes to draw out any blood. Drain, rinse, then return meat and bones to the same pot. Add fresh water to cover by 1 inch, then bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Cook for 10 minutes (there should be foam and cloudy proteins that float to the top.) Drain and rinse meat and bones well, transfer to a large bowl, and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn the same large pot, heat oil and annatto seeds over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until oil becomes bright red, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard seeds. Add onion, lemongrass, and chile flakes to the annatto oil and cook, stirring often until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nAdd lime leaves, salt, sugar, fish sauce, MSG (if using), and pineapple (if using), along with prepared meat and bones and 5 quarts (4.7L) water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until ham hocks are fork-tender but not falling off the bone, about 1 hour. Transfer ham hocks to a large bowl, let cool slightly, then cover and refrigerate.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nContinue to cook broth until beef shank is fork-tender, 2 to 4 hours longer. Remove beef shank, transfer to cutting board, let stand until cool enough to handle, then slice beef shank 1/4 inch thick and set aside. Strain broth, discard solids, then return broth to pot.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nMeanwhile, in a small pot, combine shrimp paste with 2 cups (475ml) water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, stir, and let sit for 30 minutes. Using a laddle or large spoon, transfer shrimp-paste liquid to the broth, being careful to leave any shrimp paste sediment behind. Season to taste with sugar and/or fish sauce. Hold broth warm over low heat until ready to serve.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nFor serving:\nRewarm ham hocks in the broth. In each soup bowl, add 7 ounces (200g) noodles, top with 5 or 6 slices reserved beef shank, 1 ham hock, 1 slice pork blood cake, and 2 or 3 pieces steamed ham, followed by a handful each of green onions, yellow onion, and cilantro.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nReturn broth to a boil, then ladle enough hot broth into each bowl to cover noodles.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nServe immediately with a plate of fresh mint, banana blossom or cabbage, bean sprouts, chiles, and lime wedges alongside, as well as extra shrimp paste if desired.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge stock pot\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis is a dish that keeps getting better as it sits, but you should only cook the noodles the day you serve them, because they will become brittle once refrigerated.\nAll of the garnishes can be prepped up to 4 hours in advance and refrigerated in airtight containers.\nThe broth can be strained and refrigerated in airtight containers for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months. The beef shank can be refrigerated in a container with some of the broth (so it stays juicy) for up to 5 days.\nThe Latest\nNoodle Mains\nSoups\nRice Noodles\nVietnamese"
