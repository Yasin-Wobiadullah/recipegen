Discard onion and bay leaves. Drain beans, reserving liquid. (See note for pressure cooker or canned bean variations).\nHeat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, garlic, and jalape\u00f1o (if using) and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add beans and chipotle (if using) and cook, folding with a wooden spoon until homogenous. Add 2 cups of reserved bean liquid. Mash beans with a potato masher until desired consistency is reached, adding extra cooking liquid as necessary to loosen to desired texture. If smoother texture is required, use a hand blender or a food processor to process beans to desired texture. Season with salt to taste. Serve. Uneaten beans can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nTacos Go Vegan: Grilled Marinated Heart Of Palm Tacos\nMexican\nDairy-free Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides"
