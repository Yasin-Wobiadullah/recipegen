Whisk hot coffee or tea with chopped chocolate and cocoa in a medium bowl until smooth. Combine butter, brown sugar, baking powder, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low speed to moisten. Increase to medium and cream until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes, pausing at the halfway point to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. While still mixing, add egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low and add 1/3 of flour, followed by 1/3 of the chocolate paste. Alternate between the two, forming a chocolaty batter. Fold once or twice from the bottom up to ensure no streaks of flour or butter remain. Transfer half of batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 5/8- or 1/2-inch round tip.\nDab a little batter under each corner of parchment, then press firmly to secure it to sheet pans. Pipe about fifteen 2 3/4-inch by 1-inch \"buns\" onto each sheet pan, refilling the bag when needed. Bake until \"buns\" are puffy and firm, about 8 minutes. Slide parchment onto the counter and cool until no trace of warmth remains. Use immediately or transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper between each layer; store at room temperature up to 24 hours.\nTo Finish:\nTransfer Homemade Cool Whip, Cherry Pit Whipped Cream, or your favorite whipped frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a 5/8- or 1/2-inch round tip. Flip half the \"buns\" upside down and pipe about 1 tablespoon of filling down the center of each. Top with remaining \"buns\" and press gently to secure. Enjoy immediately, or refrigerate in an airtight container up to 6 hours.\nSpecial equipment\n2 aluminum half sheet pans; stand mixer; 2 disposable pastry bags, fitted with a 5/8- or 1/2-inch round tip\nNotes\nThis recipe was tested with bleached all-purpose flour from both Pillsbury and Gold Medal, which use red and white wheat to create a tender, low-protein blend. Flours that use 100% red wheat will create a stiffer batter and less tender cake.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nDIY Devil Dogs: The Sweetest Sandwich Around\nBaking\nBaking\nChocolate\nChristmas Desserts"
