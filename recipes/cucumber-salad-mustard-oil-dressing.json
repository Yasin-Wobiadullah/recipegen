Cut each cucumber in half lengthwise and then into thin slices. Place sliced cucumbers in medium mixing bowl.\nUsing whisk or fork, thoroughly mix mustard oil and lime juice in small bowl and pour over cucumbers. Add toasted hazelnuts and pepper flakes. Stir to combine. Season to taste with salt.

If you are concerned about the levels of erucic acid in commonly available mustard oils, you can purchase Yandilla mustard oil in stores or online. It contains a relatively lower amount of erucic acid and is thus approved by the FDA for human consumption.\nRead More\nThe Truth About Mustard Oil: Behind the \"For External Use Only\" Label\nCurry Leaf and Mustard Oil Mayonnaise\nCrispy Roasted Potatoes with Curry Leaf and Mustard Oil Mayonnaise\nDebittered Olive Oil or Mustard Oil\nIndian\nDairy-free Salads\nGluten-free Salads\nVegan Salads\nVegetarian Salads",
