Slice off the strawberries' leafy caps, removing as little fruit as possible. Leave small and medium berries whole, but cut the largest ones in half. Toss with sugar, salt, and lemon juice in a 2-quart glass or ceramic baking dish. Add the empty vanilla pod, if using.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRoast, stirring once or twice along the way, until the berries are fork tender and swimming in bright red juice, about 30 minutes (see note). If you didn't use a spent vanilla pod, stir in one drop of vanilla extract along with the rose water, taking care not to crush the tender berries. Serve warm, or refrigerate to use as a jammy syrup. In an airtight container, the roasted fruit and syrup can be refrigerated up to 2 weeks.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n2-quart glass or ceramic baking dish\nNotes\nThis recipe deliberately calls for a used vanilla pod or vanilla extract, since a fresh vanilla pod can overwhelm the flavor of the berries.\nThe baking time can vary greatly depending on your baking dish's size, shape, and conductivity, so check on the fruit in the oven to ensure it doesn't cook too fast.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nRoasted fruit and syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.\nRead More\nEasy No-Bake Cheesecake\nVanilla Bean Panna Cotta\nOvernight Brown-Butter Yeast-Raised Waffles\nCondiments & Sauces\nRoasting\nStrawberry\nDessert Sauces\nMother's Day"
