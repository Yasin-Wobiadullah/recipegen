In a large bowl, pour milk over bread and let soak about 30 seconds. Add ground round, pork, onion, garlic, 1/4 cup chili sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, parsley, Parmesan, eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Using your hands, mix until combined, but do not overmix or your meatloaf will become dense.\nDivide mixture in half. Gently form each half into a log, placing one log in an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Do not press down or into corners. For other log, you may refrigerate (for up to 1 day) or freeze for later use.\nBake 50 minutes. Mix together 1/8 cup of chili sauce and ketchup and the tablespoon of brown sugar. Brush glaze onto top of loaf; continue cooking until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 160\u00b0F, about 10 minutes more.\nRemove from oven; let rest 5 minutes. Turn loaf out of pan; slice into 3/4-inch-thick slices.\nRepeat step 3 for second loaf.\nNote:\nFor even more crisp edge surface, you can form meat mixture into a loaf shape and bake directly drip pan."
