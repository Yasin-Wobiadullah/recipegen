Remove from heat, stir in mint leaves, cover, and let steep for 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nIn another stainless steel saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well-combined. Quickly strain dairy into pot with egg yolks, pressing on the mint with the back of a spoon to extract as much mint flavor as possible. Whisk until fully combined, then set over medium heat and cook, whisking frequently, until a custard forms on a spoon and a finger swiped across the back leaves a clean line, or until custard temperature reaches 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C). Add salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nPour custard through a fine-mesh strainer into an airtight container and chill in an ice bath or refrigerator until temperature drops to 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), about 4 hours for ice bath, up to overnight for refrigerator.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nChurn ice cream according to manufacturer's instructions. While ice cream churns, melt chocolate in a microwave or double boiler and stir to combine with oil. During final minutes of churning (ice cream should have the consistency of soft serve), slowly drizzle chocolate into ice cream to form thin, lacy lines, pausing to break up larger chocolate chunks with a spoon, if needed. Transfer churned ice cream to an airtight container and harden in freezer for at least 4 hours before serving.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\n, two stainless steel\nsaucepans\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nRead More\nSmoked Honey Mint Chip Ice Cream Recipe\nMint Oreo Ice Cream Recipe\nMint Julep Ice Cream Recipe\nStracciatella Gelato (Sweet Cream Chocolate Chip) Recipe\nSecret Tools and Tricks of the Ice Cream Pros\nThe Subtle Secrets to Making the Best Ice Cream Mix-Ins\nIce Cream\nMint\nMother's Day\nFather's Day\nSummer Desserts",
