Drain well.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a small pot, combine oil, drained spices, scallion, shallot, ginger, and garlic. Set over low heat and cook until the scallion and garlic are gently frying and have turned an amber brown color, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat, strain into a heatproof container, and let cool; discard the solids.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Vinaigrette:\nIn a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sugar, black vinegar, and seasoning oil until sugar is dissolved. The final dressing will not remain emulsified, so mix or shake it just before using.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nThe seasoning oil is entirely customizable. Many Chinese restaurants and households have their own signature blend of aromatics and spices for their infused oils. Other popular additions include: coriander seeds, cinnamon, fennel, cumin, black cardamom, cloves, galangal, lemongrass, onions, Chinese celery, and carrots.\nThe seasoning oil is a great base for hot dishes as well: stir-fries, rice, noodles, and stews can all be made with this highly aromatic oil.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe strained seasoning oil can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.\nRead More\nChayote and Apple Salad With Citrus Dressing Recipe\nChinese Eggplant Salad Recipe\nChinese Spinach and Peanut Salad Recipe\nChinese Cold Noodle Salad with Sesame Dressing Recipe\nSichuan-Style Smashed Cucumber Salad Recipe\nLao Hu Cai (Tiger Salad) Recipe, \u00e0 la Xi'an Famous Foods\nFats & Oils\nChinese\nSalad Dressing\nThe Latest",
