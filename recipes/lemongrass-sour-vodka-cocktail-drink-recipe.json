Chop stalks into 1-inch pieces and bruise them by crushing them with the blunt side of a heavy knife. For slow infusion, add lemongrass pieces to an airtight container and cover with vodka. Seal and let stand at room temperature for 1 week, shaking daily. Taste after 1 week and continue to steep up to 2 weeks to desired flavor. Pour through fine-mesh strainer into an airtight container.\nAlternatively, to infuse instantly using a whipping siphon, take lemongrass pieces and add to siphon canister. Pour in vodka and seal. Charge with one N2O charger. Shake well. Charge a second time with a second N2O charger. Shake well and then discharge contents through a strainer into a clean, airtight container. Infused vodka keeps at room temperature for up to 6 months.\nFor Each Cocktail:\nIn a cocktail shaker, add Lemongrass-Infused Vodka, lime juice, simple syrup, and egg white. Shake without ice for 30 seconds to incorporate the egg white. Fill cocktail shaker with ice, then shake hard until well chilled, about 30 seconds. Double strain with cocktail strainer and a fine-mesh strainer into cocktail glass and garnish with lemon bitters and lime zest.\nSerious Eats / Elana Lepkowski\nSpecial Equipment\nCocktail shaker\n,\ncocktail strainer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n, airtight containers,\nwhipping siphon\nand two N20 chargers (optional)\nNotes\nFor those concerned about the raw egg, use 2 tablespoons of pasteurized egg white instead.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nInfused vodka will keep in an airtight, non-reactive container at room temperature for up to 6 months.\nVodka\nSpring Drinks\nLemongrass",
