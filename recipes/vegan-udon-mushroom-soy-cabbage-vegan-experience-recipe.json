Bring to a boil over high heat, then remove from heat and let rest 10 minutes while mushrooms rehydrate. Remove mushrooms with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add fresh mushroom scraps and stems, bottom 1-inch of scallions, garlic cloves, onion, and kombu to pot. Bring to a boil and reduce to a low simmer. Cook for 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nMeanwhile, rip out the tough central stems from the wood ear mushrooms and discard. Slice wood ears and morels into strips and transfer to a small bowl. Slice fresh mushrooms and add to bowl (if using enoki, reserve separately). Finely slice remaining scallion tops and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nWhen broth is simmered, strain through a fine-mesh strainer and return to pot, discarding solids. Add soy sauce and mirin and season to taste with salt. You should have about 1 quart of broth. Keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nHeat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or a 12-inch skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add mushrooms (except for enoki, if using) and stir-fry until lightly browned and completely tender, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and transfer to a plate. Add remaining tablespoon oil and heat until lightly smoking. Add cabbage and stir-fry until tender and charred in spots, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to plate with mushrooms.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nCook udon in boiling water according to package directions, adding fried tofu to the water as they cook to heat. Strain and divide noodles between 2 serving bowls. Pour hot broth over noodles. Top with chopped scallions, stir-fried mushrooms and cabbage, raw enoki (if using), and fried tofu. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nNotes\nDried wood ear mushrooms can be found in most Asian grocers. Dried morel mushrooms can be found at specialty grocers and many supermarkets. If unavailable, substitute porcini, chanterelle, or any other dried mushroom.\nKombu is dried sea kelp and can be found in most Asian grocers. Mirin is a sweet Japanese rice-based wine that can be found in most Asian grocers. Fried tofu can be found packaged in the refrigerated section of most Asian grocers.\nJapanese\nDairy-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Noodles"
