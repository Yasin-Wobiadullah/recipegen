Working in batches, arrange onion slices on a microwave-safe plate, making sure they either don't overlap or overlap minimally; arrange garlic cloves around the onions. Brush with olive oil to generously coat, then microwave on high power until onions and garlic are tender and softened, about 8 minutes. (Microwave power can vary a lot, so keep an eye on your onions to avoid overcooking or undercooking.) Very carefully transfer cooked onions and garlic to a platter. Repeat with remaining onions.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, remove garlic from skins and trim root ends of cloves. Mince garlic. In a medium mixing bowl, thoroughly stir together ricotta, minced cooked garlic, thyme, and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nCarefully unfold defrosted puff pastry onto prepared baking sheet, gently pressing it flat. Spread ricotta mixture all over puff pastry in an even layer, making sure to leave a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Arrange the cooked onion rounds on top and bake until puff pastry is golden and crisp and onions have browned slightly, 20-25 minutes; if puff pastry swells excessively during baking, carefully use a paring knife to puncture the air bubble and deflate.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nLet cool slightly, then sprinkle with more thyme leaves, cut into portions, and serve.\nSerious Eats/ Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet, parchment paper, microwave-safe plate\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nSnacks & Appetizers\nBreakfast & Brunch\nVegetable Mains"
