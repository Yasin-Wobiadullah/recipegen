Lightly coat all the bones with oil and arrange in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet or in a roasting pan. Roast, turning bones once or twice, until beginning to turn golden-brown, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nMeanwhile, lightly toss onion, carrot, and celery in oil. When step 1 is complete, scatter all over and around bones and continue roasting until bones and vegetables are nicely browned, about 30 minutes longer. Be careful not to let anything scorch.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nTransfer beef bones and roasted vegetables to a pressure cooker. Pour off and discard (or save) any accumulated fat from the roasting pan. Pour a thin layer of boiling water into roasting pan and scrape up any browned bits. Pour pan juices into pressure cooker.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nAdd garlic, thyme, parsley, and tomato paste to pressure cooker. Add enough cold water to bring level to the cooker's max-fill line; do not let water exceed the max-fill line, even if some solids are not submerged.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nClose pressure cooker, bring to high pressure, and cook for 2 hours 30 minutes. Allow cooker to depressurize naturally. Open cooker and strain stock through a fine-mesh strainer (discard solids, though if there's a shank in there, be sure to eat it).\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nSkim the stock by either carefully ladling off the top layer of fat while stock is still hot, or, for greater ease, refrigerate stock until well chilled, then remove the solid cap of fat that rises to the top.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nPortion stock into storage containers or\nzipper-lock bags\n(if it's been chilled, reheat it to a liquid state first), then freeze or refrigerate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nSpecial Equipment\nPressure cooker\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nMake sure the beef bones are cut short enough to fit into your pressure cooker (ask your butcher to cut them shorter if not). You can use any assortment of bones your butcher has, but bones with bits of meat still attached will give more flavor, while connective-tissue-rich options like joints and feet will deliver more gelatin to the stock; you can also include some veal bones for even more gelatin. A cross-cut beef shank, while not required, will boost the flavor even more; eat it after cooking so it doesn't go to waste.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBeef stock can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to a week, or frozen for up to six months.\nRead More\nPressure Cooker Brown Chicken Stock\nPressure Cooker Chicken Stock\nWhat a Pressure Cooker Does Best\nRoasted Marrow Bones\nPressure Cooked Beef"
