  "full_text": "Reverse-Seared Roast Pork Shoulder Chashu Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n4 hrs 5 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nDry-Brining and Marinating Time\n48 hrs\nTotal\n52 hrs 10 mins\nServes\n10 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\nounce\n(\n14\ng\n)\nkosher salt\n(see note)\n1/2\nounce\n(\n14\ng\n)\ngranulated sugar\n(see note)\n1\npork shoulder\nroast\n(about\n2\npounds\n;\n900\ng\n)\n1\ntablespoon\n(\n15\nml\n)\nsoy sauce\n1\ntablespoon\n(\n15\nml\n)\nmirin\nDirections\nCombine salt and sugar in a small bowl and mix thoroughly.\nPlace pork shoulder roast in a zip-top bag. Pour salt-sugar mixture into bag and massage mixture evenly into meat. Seal bag, trying to avoid leaving much air inside.\nPlace bag in refrigerator for 24 hours. Roughly every 8 hours, massage bag and flip it over to ensure even distribution of the cure.\nOpen bag and add soy sauce and mirin. Seal bag and massage meat again to ensure even distribution of brine and marinade. Place in refrigerator for another 24 hours, massaging bag and flipping it roughly every 8 hours.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet large enough to comfortably accommodate the roast.\nRemove roast from bag and blot completely dry. Using kitchen twine, tie at 1/2-inch intervals to form a neat cylinder. Place roast on rack set in rimmed baking sheet. If using a probe thermometer, insert in center of roast. Place roast in oven and cook until internal temperature registers 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C), or the temperature of your choosing, about 3 to 4 hours. Remove roast from oven.\nIf Finishing Under the Broiler:\nAdjust oven rack so that the roast will be about 1 inch away from the broiler element. Preheat broiler to high. When broiler is hot, place roast, still on its rack in the rimmed baking sheet, under broiler, turning frequently, until exterior is charred, about 5 minutes.\nIf Finishing With a Handheld Torch:\nTurn on torch and char exterior of roast on all sides.\nThe roast can immediately be sliced very thinly and served on top of ramen. Alternatively, the roast can be chilled before slicing, which facilitates slicing it thinly. To chill, allow roast to cool to room temperature, then wrap tightly in plastic and place in refrigerator for 6 hours or overnight. Or, seal the roast in a vacuum-sealed bag or in a zip-top bag using the\nwater-displacement method\n, then place sealed roast in an ice bath to rapidly chill.\nSpecial equipment\nLeave-in probe thermometer\nor\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\n, kitchen twine, handheld torch (optional)\nNotes\nThe amount of salt-sugar cure should be adjusted if you're using a pork roast that is slightly larger or slightly smaller than 2 pounds. Use 3% of the weight of the pork roast in salt-sugar cure mixture.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe pork shoulder roast is best made 1 day prior to serving and will keep for about 3 days in the fridge. The roast can also be sliced for freezing in individual portions, but its quality will suffer.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Pork Shoulder\nChashu\nfor Ramen\nPork Shoulder\nJapanese\nRoasted Pork",
