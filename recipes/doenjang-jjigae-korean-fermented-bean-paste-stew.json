Cover the saucepan halfway with a lid and maintain low simmer for 15 minutes. Taste an anchovy; if it still has a noticeable amount of flavor left in it, continue simmering until most of the flavor has been cooked out. Strain, discarding solids.\nMeanwhile, For the Stew:\nFill a large bowl with cold water and stir in enough salt to make it salty like the sea. Add clams and let stand 30 minutes. Lift clams from water and discard purging water; if there is sand in the bottom of the bowl, rinse it out and repeat this process until clams no longer release sand into the water (usually 2 to 3 purging cycles). Drain clams, discarding any that are gaping open and refuse to close when prodded.\nIn a small heatproof bowl, cover mushrooms with boiling water and let steep until rehydrated, about 10 minutes. Drain, then slice mushroom caps 1/4 inch thick.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd stock to a large saucepan or earthenware pot. Bring to a boil. Add mushrooms, summer squash, onion, scallion, and wild chives (if using). Return to a boil and cook until the vegetables are beginning to become tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and doenjang (try dissolving the doenjang through a sieve to prevent lumps from forming).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSimmer for 2 minutes longer, then add clams. Cook until clams begin to pop open. Add red and green chiles and continue cooking until all the clams are open.\nTaste the broth, and add joseon ganjang, if desired, to increase the savory, salty flavor. Serve doenjang jjigae hot, with sides of rice and kimchi.\nNotes\nSsal-ddeumul\n(\uc300\ub728\ubb3c, or rice-rinsed water) is a useful ingredient in Korean cooking, both for its nutrients and the mild, starchy flavors it adds to food. Use the cloudy water that runs off from the second or third time you wash your uncooked rice (not the first, which might have dust and other impurities).\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe stew can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, then reheated when ready to serve. Thin with water if it becomes too reduced and salty.\nRead More\nHow To Stock a Korean Pantry\nAn Introduction to the Spicy, Funky World of Korean Soups and Stews\nAn Introduction to Korean Barbecue\nKimchi 101\nSoups\nKorean\nStovetop Seafood\nClams\nAnchovies",
