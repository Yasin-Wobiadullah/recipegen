Discard 4 of the quarters (the rind of 1 grapefruit). Thinly slice remaining quarters lengthwise, then roughly chop them crosswise into smaller pieces. Transfer rinds to a large pot and add 2 cups of water and baking soda. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover, lower the heat, and simmer until the rinds are soft and beginning to turn translucent, about 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, roughly chop grapefruit and remove any seeds. Transfer grapefruit to a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Add fruit to pot with the rind and return the mixture to a simmer. Simmer, covered, until the fruit has softened a bit, about 15 minutes.\nMeasure 5 cups of the fruit mixture, making sure to get a good combination of rind, fruit, and juice. Discard the remaining fruit mixture. Return the reserved 5 cups of the fruit mixture to the pot. Stir in the pectin and butter and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Add sugar all at once and return the mixture to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly.
