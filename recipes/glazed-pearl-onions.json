  "full_text": "Glazed Pearl Onions\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n30 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n45 mins\nServes\n6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\npounds\npearl onions\n(see notes)\n3\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n1\ntablespoon\nsugar\nKosher salt\n2\ntablespoons\nfinely\nchopped\nfresh parsley\nDirections\nUsing a paring knife, trim off the ends of each onion and score a light \"X\" into one cut side. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add onions and cook until outer layers are soft, about 1 1/2 minutes. Drain onions and run under cool water until cold enough to handle. Peel onions with your fingers and discard peels.\nTransfer onions to a large saucepan or high-sided saut\u00e9 pan and cover with water. Add butter and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring and shaking pan occasionally, until onions are completely tender and sauce water has reduced and emulsified with the butter into a glossy glaze, about 25 minutes (if butter looks greasy or broken, add 2 tablespoons of water and shake pan to bring glaze back together). Season to taste with salt. Stir in parsley, and serve.\nNotes\nFrozen pearl onions can be used in place of fresh. To use frozen onions, cook direct from frozen, skipping step 1.\nRead More\nCreamed Pearl Onions\nHow to Peel Pearl Onions\nVegetable Sides\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop Vegetables\nOnions",
