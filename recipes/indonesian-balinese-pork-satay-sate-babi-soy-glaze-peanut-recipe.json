Pound into a fine paste. (For an easier method, pound with the mortar and pestle until a rough paste is formed, then transfer to a\nfood processor\nto reduce to a fine paste. I do not recommend using the food processor alone if you want maximum flavor.) Divide mixture into thirds.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nCombine pork and one-third of spice paste in a large bowl and toss with your hands until all of pork is thoroughly coated in the mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes or up to overnight. Thread pork onto skewers. To do this efficiently, cut an onion or potato in half and place it on your cutting board. Place a piece of pork on top of it and push through it with the skewer. Repeat until each skewer has about 6 inches of pork threaded onto it. Pork should be pushed together quite tightly. Discard onion half (or grill it) after use. Keep pork skewers refrigerated until ready to cook.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nFor the Glaze:\nMeanwhile, combine kecap manis, sugar, ginger, and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook until glaze is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in one-third of spice paste and adjust seasoning with more sugar as necessary. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, using the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids. Leftover glaze can be stored indefinitely in a covered container in the refrigerator.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nFor the Dipping Sauce:\nPound peanuts with the mortar and pestle until reduced to a rough powder. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add remaining third of spice paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add peanuts, tamarind juice, remaining oil, kecap manis or fish sauce, and 1/2 cup (120ml) water. Stir to combine. Once liquid comes to a simmer and turns creamy, adjust consistency with more water as necessary to produce a creamy sauce that just barely flows. Season to taste with a little sugar if desired. Leftover sauce can be stored for several weeks in a covered container in the refrigerator.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTo Cook:\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes.\nClean and oil\nthe grilling grate.\nWorking in batches as necessary, place pork directly over hot side of grill. Immediately start fanning coals or flames with a large piece of cardboard or with the hose of a Shop-Vac to prevent flare-ups. Cook, fanning constantly and turning pork occasionally, until pork is cooked through and browned on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Transfer pork to cooler side of grill and brush on all sides with glaze. Return to hot side of grill and cook, turning, just until glaze starts to bubble and get sticky, about 45 seconds. Transfer skewers to a serving platter and repeat until all pork is cooked.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nBrush pork with another layer of glaze just before serving and serve with peanut sauce on the side or spooned on top.\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle\n;\nbamboo or metal skewers\n(soak bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes before using); a stiff piece of cardboard, a fan, or a Shop-Vac;\nfood processor\n(optional);\nfine-mesh strainer\n,\ncharcoal grill\nNotes\nTo soak and strain tamarind pulp, combine 2 tablespoons (30g) pulp with 2 tablespoons (30ml) warm water and massage with your fingertips until softened. Press through a fine-mesh strainer. Keep the juice and discard the remaining pulp.\nKecap manis is a sweet Indonesian soy sauce that can be found in most Asian markets.\nRead More\nHow to Get Started Grilling\nHow to Set Up Your Grill for Better Skewers, Kebabs, and Yakitori\nGrilled Pork\nIndonesian\nPeanuts\nPork Shoulder\nPork Mains",
