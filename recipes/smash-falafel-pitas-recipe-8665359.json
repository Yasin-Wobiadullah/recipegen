Spread about 1/3 cup of homemade falafel into a thin layer over each pita half.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Hufham\nHeat 2 teaspoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium. Working with 1 pita half at a time, place pita falafel-side-down into skillet and press firmly with a flat spatula. Cook, undisturbed, until falafel is golden brown and edges are crisped, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to plate, falafel-side-up. Repeat with remaining oil and pita, adding 1 teaspoon oil to skillet in between each pita.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Hufham\nTop falafel with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, chopped cucumber, and pickles. Drizzle with tahini sauce and zhug, if desired. Fold pitas in half over fillings and serve warm.\nSpecial Equipment\nSerrated knife, palette knife\nNotes\nPita bread that has dried out can be steamed in the microwave to make it more pliable. To do this, just stack the pitas and wrap them in a damp paper towel, then microwave on high for about 10 seconds, until warmed through, steaming, and softened.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThese pitas are best eaten immediately, but you can prepare all the components (falafel mixture, sauces, veggies) one day in advance and store them in separate airtight containers in the fridge.\nChickpeas\nThe Latest\nMiddle Eastern\nVegetarian"
