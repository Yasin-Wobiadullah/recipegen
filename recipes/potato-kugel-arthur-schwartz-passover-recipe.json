  "full_text": "Potato Kugel Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n85 mins\nResting Time\n15 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 5 mins\nServes\n12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\npounds\nrusset\n(baking)\npotatoes\n12\neggs\n2\nmedium\nonions\n(\n12\nounces\n), peeled and cut into chunks\n2/3\ncup\nmatzoh\nmeal\n1\ntablespoon\nsalt\n3/4 to 1\nteaspoon\nground black pepper\n3\ntablespoons\nvegetable oil\n(for a parve pudding) or schmaltz\nDirections\nPreheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F.\nPeel the potatoes and chunk them up, getting them ready for the food processor. Keep in a bowl of cold water until ready to process, but don't leave them there longer than a few hours.\nIn a very large bowl, beat together the eggs, until well mixed.\nIn the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, pulse the onion until very finely chopped, but not liquefied. Scrape the onions into the bowl with the eggs and stir them in. Stir in the matzoh meal.\nDrain the potatoes. In the same processor bowl (no need to clean), in three batches, process the potatoes until very finely chopped. The pieces should be no bigger than a grain of rice and mostly smaller.\nAs each batch of potatoes is processed, immediately scrape it into a strainer placed over a bowl. With a rubber spatula or the back of a spoon, press out the moisture. Immediately, stir the potatoes into the onion and egg mixture. Discard the liquid and potato starch that will settle in the bowl. Season the batter with salt and pepper.\nPour 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or schmaltz into a 13 by 9-inch baking pan, preferably glass. Turn the pan to coat the bottom and half way up the sides with the oil or schmaltz. Place the empty pan in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.\nRemove the oiled pan from the oven and pour the potato batter into the pan. The oil will come up the sides of the pan, especially in the corners. Press the batter down near the corners to lightly to fill them with potato batter. It's a good thing when the oil comes over the top of the batter. It adds crispness. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of oil or melted schmaltz on the surface of the batter.\nBake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until lightly browned.\nLet rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving, preferably somewhat longer. Serve hot or warm, freshly baked or reheated.\nThe kugel reheats extremely well in a 350\u00b0F oven, uncovered so the top can crisp up additionally. Reheating time depends on the size of the piece being reheated, and at what temperature the kugel is when going into the oven. It can be kept in the refrigerator for at least four days, and for several months in the freezer. It is best to defrost before reheating.\nVegetable Mains\nPassover\nSavory\nRusset Potatoes"
