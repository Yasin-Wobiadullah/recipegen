In a jar, combine the vinegar, olive oil, garlic, grain mustard, honey, cr\u00e8me fraiche, and salt and pepper. Twist on the cap and shake vigorously.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\nPound the pork chops by placing them between two pieces of plastic wrap and smacking them repeatedly with a rolling pin until they are about 1/2-inch thick. Season well with salt and freshly cracked black pepper.\nSet up your breading station by putting the flour in one pan. The eggs and Dijon mustard should be beaten together with salt and pepper in the second pan. The panko and baguette crumbs should be tossed together in the third pan. Pass the pounded pork pieces lightly through all three stations, shaking off any excess.\nHeat a cast iron skillet over medium heat and add just enough oil to coat the bottom and rise up 1/4-inch or so--enough to shallow fry.\nCook the pork about three minutes on each side, until golden. Transfer to a baking sheet, and finish cooking for 5 minutes in the oven.\nPork Mains\nSpinach"
