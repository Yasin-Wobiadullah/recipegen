You should have about 7 cups; if significantly less, this may be a sign the popcorn is dense and stale and that a newer batch of kernels is in order.\nIn a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water, golden or corn syrup, butter or cocoa butter, and sugar over medium heat. Stir with a fork until bubbling hot, about 4 minutes. Increase to medium-high, clip on a digital thermometer and cook without stirring until the syrup is 340\u00b0F (171\u00b0C), about 10 minutes. If the process is taking too long, simply increase the heat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, lightly grease a rimmed half sheet pan, and prepare the remaining ingredients so they\u2019re ready to add at a moment\u2019s notice. When the syrup comes to temperature, remove from heat, stir in chocolate with a heat-resistant spatula, followed by the baking soda and salt. When the mixture is foamy, pour over the popcorn and fold until the pieces are thoroughly coated.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nScrape onto the prepared baking sheet, pulling the chunks of popcorn into bite-sized clusters with a pair of metal forks. Cool until the soft candy shell is hard and crisp, about 45 minutes, then transfer to an airtight container. It\u2019s best to store the popcorn as soon as it's cooled, as excessive exposure to air may cause it to soften from humidity. Store up to 2 weeks at room temperature, or 1 month in the fridge.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart\nstainless steel saucier\n,\ndigital thermometer with clip\n,\nheat resistant spatula\n,\nhalf sheet pan\nNotes\nTo make 7 cups of popcorn, start with 2 ounces of kernels, popped according to whatever method you prefer. Try Daniel's\nmicrowave method\n, or make it like Kenji and grab a\nWhirley Pop\n.\nRead More\nMatcha and White Chocolate Popcorn\nBrown-Butter Maple Popcorn With Pecans\nCran-Apple White Chocolate Popcorn\nCandy\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nStovetop\nChocolate\nPopcorn"
