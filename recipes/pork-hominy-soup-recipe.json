Stir to combine, and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to the oven to cook until pork is fork-tender, about 2 hours.\nRemove soup from oven and transfer pork from broth to a platter to cool. When pork is cool enough to handle, shred meat and discard any fat or gristle. Strain broth and return liquid to pan. Add hominy and shredded pork. Season with salt, if necessary, and simmer over medium heat for 30 minutes.\nLadle into bowls immediately and serve with lime wedges, avocados, red onions, cilantro, radishes and tortilla chips.\nNotes\nThe soup may be made a day in advance. Just reheat it on the stovetop and don't add the toppings until you're ready to serve it.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nSoups\nStovetop Pork\nPork\nHominy"
