Carefully lower eggs into pot and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer), and continue cooking for 11 minutes. Serve immediately if serving hot. If serving cold, immediately place eggs in bowl of ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under cool running water.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nTo peel, first gently tap hard-boiled eggs all over to thoroughly crack the shell, then remove shell under a thin stream of running water. (The water helps get under the shell and lift it off the egg.)\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nNotes\nFor an easier, quicker, and even more foolproof version, see our\nrecipe for steamed eggs\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nShell-on hard-boiled eggs can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
