Place lid on wok and use overlap of foil to seal shut.\nTurn on exhaust fan and open all windows in the house. Over high heat, toast tea and rice until smoky wisps begin to emerge from wok, 3 to 6 minutes. Toast for 5-7 minutes longer, then shut off heat and let fish sit in wok for 5 to 7 minutes longer. The smells will begin to turn smoky - turn off heat before you smell burning. Fish will be golden to dark brown, depending on time and type of tea. Serve room temperature or refrigerate and serve cold. Fish may be kept in refrigerator for about a week.\nSpecial Equipment\nHeavy-duty aluminum foil\nFish\nAsian\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nSmoking"
