Spread vegetables out in an even layer and roast, stirring vegetables and rotating the baking sheet once halfway through cooking, until a paring knife can easily pierce beets and carrots, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from heat, cover with a layer of foil, and let rest 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, for the Sweet Lime Dressing:\nIn a small bowl, whisk the lime juice and zest, garlic, sugar, black pepper, and red pepper flakes until the sugar dissolves completely. While drizzling in a slow, steady stream, whisk in olive oil to form a creamy dressing. Season with salt.\nIn a large serving bowl, toss roasted beets, carrots, and onions with the dressing until evenly coated. Garnish with the sesame seeds, scallions, and crispy shallots. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dressing can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 8 hours. Shake well before dressing the roasted vegetables.\nRoasted Vegetables\nGluten-free Sides\nVegetarian\nGluten-free\nVegetables",
