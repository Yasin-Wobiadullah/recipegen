Let soak for 20 minutes, then mash the tamarind with your fingers. Pour the mash and its liquid into a strainer placed over an empty bowl. Press down on the tamarind pulp with your fingers until only the seeds and fiber are left in the strainer. Discard the contents of the strainer. Add remaining fish sauce and sugar along with sliced chiles and mix to combine. Set aside.\nRemove the pork from marinade and pat dry with a paper towel.
