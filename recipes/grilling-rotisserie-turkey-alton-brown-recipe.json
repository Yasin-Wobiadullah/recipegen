Remove from heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate to 40\u00b0F.\nIn large non-reactive container, combine brine with cold water. Set turkey in brine, breast side down, placing a weight on top to keep turkey submerged if necessary. Place in refrigerator and let brine for 8 to 16 hours.\nRemove turkey from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Place turkey on rack over rimmed baking sheet and allow to air-dry overnight in refrigerator.\n(This step is optional, but will result in a crisper skin.)\nCombine apple, onion, cinnamon, and water in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add to turkey's cavity, along with rosemary and sage. Close turkey cavity by threading wooden skewer through flaps of skin. Fold wings under body and tie legs together. Allow turkey to come to room temperature while you prepare grill.\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on either side of charcoal grate. Place foil pan between two piles of coals to capture drippings to serve with turkey or to make gravy. Place turkey on rotisserie and cook over medium heat until instant read thermometer registers 155\u00b0F in thickest part of the breast, 2 to 3 hours. Remove turkey from rotisserie and let rest for 20 minutes, carve and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nRotisserie\nTurkey Mains\nGrilled Turkey\nWhole Turkey\nThanksgiving Turkeys\nChristmas Dinners",
