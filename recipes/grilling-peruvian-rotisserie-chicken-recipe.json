Rub the paste all over the inside and outside of the chicken, including under the skin. Place the chicken in a large Ziploc bag and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hour, but preferably overnight.\nRemove the chicken from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature while you prepare the grill. Light a chimney 3/4 full of charcoal. When the charcoal is fully lit and covered in gray ash, pour the coals out and arrange them on either side of the charcoal grate, keeping the middle empty. Place chicken on the rotisserie and cook at 300 degrees until an instant read thermometer registers 165 degrees in the thickest part of the breast, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the chicken from the rotisserie and let rest for 15 minutes, then carve and serve.\nChicken Mains\nPeruvian\nGrilled Chicken\nWhole Chicken"
