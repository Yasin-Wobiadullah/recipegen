Add enough vinegar to cover, then season with salt. If it tastes too pungent, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the flavor is a little less harsh (though it should still be very strong and pungent). Keep refrigerated in an airtight container, up to 3 weeks.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nor\nblender\nNotes\nFresh horseradish can sometimes be incredibly pungent: In some cases, once cut up and ground, it can even make the air difficult to breathe, like mustard gas. Make sure to work in a well-ventilated area, and be ready to escape to fresh air at any point if need be.\nDairy-free\nGluten-free\nVegan\nVegetarian\nNo-Cook"
