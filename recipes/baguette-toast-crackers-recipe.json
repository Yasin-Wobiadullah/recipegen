Arrange bread slices on baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle both sides with olive oil. (You don't have to cover every inch of bread or saturate it, but the drizzling should be even and consistent.) Season both sides with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nToast bread slices, rotating baking sheet from front to back and flipping slices halfway through baking, until toasts are browned and crispy throughout, about 12 minutes. Toasts can be kept at room temperature in zipper-lock bags up to overnight.\nSpecial Equipment\nBaking sheet\nSnacks & Appetizers"
