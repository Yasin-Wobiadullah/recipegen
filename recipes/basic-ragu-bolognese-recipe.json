Add carrots, celery, and onions and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 6 minutes. Add half (2 pounds) of the ground meat and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up any large pieces as you go, until well browned on bottom of pot, about 15 minutes.\nAdd remaining 2 pounds meat and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot while breaking up the meat into very small pieces, until all meat is cooked through, about 6 minutes; lower heat at any point to prevent scorching.\nAdd tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir in wine, scraping bottom of pot, and bring to a boil, then cook until raw alcohol smell has cooked off, about 5 minutes. Add bay leaves.\nAdd reserved stock, scraping all the hydrated gelatin with it, to the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer; lower heat to maintain a very gentle simmer. Season with salt and add pinch nutmeg and fish sauce. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and has almost no excess liquid remaining, about 3 hours. Skim and discard any fat from surface along with bay leaves. Stir in cream and season with salt.\nUse right away, refrigerate up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nYou can mince by hand, but for speed and ease, a food processor will make quick work of the aromatic vegetables. You can make this recipe with ground beef alone, but for even better flavor and texture, a mixture of beef, pork, and veal will deliver best results.\nRead More\nLasagna Bolognese\nPressure Cooker Rag\u00f9 Bolognese\nHomemade Fresh Pasta\nThe Best Tools For Making, Cooking, and Serving Pasta\nItalian\nStovetop Pasta\nGround Beef\nPork\nBeef Mains",
