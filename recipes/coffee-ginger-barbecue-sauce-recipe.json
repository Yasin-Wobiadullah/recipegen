Stir in chocolate and smoked paprika until chocolate is melted, then let simmer over very low heat, stirring occasionally, until flavors have mellowed and melded, 5-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nNotes\nI used a lighter coffee roast, which adds more acidity and therefore found that this sauce didn't need any extra tartness from vinegar; depending on the profile of the coffee you use, you may find a splash of vinegar (such as cider vinegar) will help. Taste and adjust accordingly.\nThis Recipe Appears In\n3 Easy Barbecue Sauce Variations to Amp up Your Weekend Grilling\nBarbecue Sauce\nGinger",
