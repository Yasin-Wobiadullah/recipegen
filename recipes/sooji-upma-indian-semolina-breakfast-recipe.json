  "full_text": "Sooji Upma (Indian Semolina Breakfast Dish)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n15 mins\nServes\n2 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nsemolina flour\n1 1/2\ntablespoons\nghee or\nvegetable oil\n1\nteaspoon\nwhole black mustard seeds\n1\nteaspoon\nsplit black gram (\nUrad dal\n)\n1\nsmall\nonion\nchopped (about\n1/2\ncup\n)\n2\nsmall\ngreen chiles\nsplit lengthwise\n10\ncurry leaves\n1/4\ncup\ndiced\nboiled carrots\n1/4\ncup\nboiled\ngreen peas\n1\nteaspoon\nred\u00a0chile powder\n1\nteaspoon\nsugar\nKosher salt\n2 1/4\ncups\nwater\nDirections\nPlace semolina in cast iron pan and cook over medium heat until toasty but not browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.\nReturn pan to medium heat and heat ghee or oil until shimmering. Add the mustard seeds and split black gram, stir until they splutter, about 30 seconds. Add the onion, fry until slightly soft, about a minute (take care not to brown). Add the slit chiles, curry leaves and stir until fragrant, about a minute longer. Add the carrots, peas, red chilli powder, and sugar, and stir until fragrant and the mixture is coated with the ghee/oil, about 1 minute.\nAdd toasted semolina and stir vigorously until the mixture resembles wet sand\u2014about a minute. Add the salt and gently pour in the water. The semolina will bubble and spurt as it absorbs the water. Reduce heat to low. Allow this mixture to cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. The Upma absorbs water very quickly and tends to dry out too, so turn off the heat when the mixture is slightly runny. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron pan\nIndian\nBreakfast & Brunch",
