  "full_text": "Long Loaves Recipe | Bread Baking\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n30 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nActive\n35 mins\nRising and Cooling Time\n2 hrs 20 mins\nTotal\n3 hrs 15 mins\nServes\n16 servings\nMakes\n4 loaves\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\nlukewarm\nwater\n1\ntablespoon\nyeast\n1\ntablespoon\nsugar\n1/2\ncup\nsemolina flour\n1\npound\n,\n2\nounces\n(about\n3 1/4\ncups\n)\nbread flour\n2\nteaspoons\nsalt\n2\ntablespoons\nolive oil\nDirections\nCombine the water, yeast, sugar, and semolina flour in the bowl of your stand mixer and set aside until it's bubbly, about 10 minutes. Add the flour and knead with dough hook until the mixture is smooth, supple, and elastic. Add the salt and olive oil and continue kneading until both are incorporated.\nFlour your work surface and turn out the dough. Knead briefly, and form the dough into a ball. Drizzle it with a bit of olive oil to coat the surface, and return it to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 50 minutes.\nFlour your work surface and sprinkle cornmeal on 2 baking sheets. Turn out the dough and divide it into 4 roughly equal pieces. Roll each piece into a log about 12 inches long. Place 2 logs on each baking sheet. They'll look a little narrow, but they will grow impressively.\nCover the dough with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for 20 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap. If it seems to be sticking, flour the surface a bit; rice flour is nice, for this but regular flour is fine. Slash the loaves as desired, and cover them with plastic wrap again. Let rise for another 10 minutes. They should be doubled in size, maybe a little more.\nBake at 350\u00b0F until golden brown, about 25 minutes, rotating the pans about halfway through the baking time. Let the loaves cool completely on a rack.\nYeast Breads\nVegan",
