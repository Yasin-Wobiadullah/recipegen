Simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the sugar is dissolved and the strawberries are soft.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nUsing an immersion blender, food processor, or a regular blender, pur\u00e9e the sauce. Strain it through a fine-mesh sieve, and loosely cover. (See notes.) Chill until cold.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nMake-Ahead and S\ntorage\nThe strawberry sauce can be stored in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week.\nPur\u00e9eing and straining the sauce removes the tiny seeds, but you can skip this last step if you don\u2019t mind a slightly grainy texture and you want to get your sauce onto your dessert as quickly as possible.\nDessert Sauces\nThe Latest\nStrawberry"
