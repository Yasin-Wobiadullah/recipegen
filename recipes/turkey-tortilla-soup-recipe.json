Add tortilla strips and fry, agitating with a metal spider or slotted spatula until strips are crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, season with salt, and set aside.\nCombine all chiles in a medium saucepan and add half of the chicken broth. Simmer over medium-high heat until the chiles are completely tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a blender or immersion blender cup and blend until completely smooth.\nWhile chiles are simmering, heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add the onions and poblano pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cumin and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add remaining chicken broth. Add chile pur\u00e9e from step 2 as soon as it is ready.\nBring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, add turkey meat, and cook until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Serve hot, passing tortilla strips, scallions, cilantro, avocado, jalape\u00f1os, and lime wedges at the table.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nblender\nor\nimmersion blender\nNotes\nYou can use store-bought tortilla strips or crumbled tortilla chips if desired. For a milder flavor, remove one ancho and one pasilla chile and replace 1 cup chicken stock in step three with one 14.4-ounce can of diced tomatoes with their juice or Ro-Tel tomatoes.\nRead More\nReal-Deal Tortilla Soup\nSopa de Lima (Yucat\u00e1n-Style Lime Soup)\nLeftover Roast Turkey Soup\nBasic Chili Paste to Replace Chili Powder\nWhat to Do With Dried Chiles: Recipes, Cooking Techniques, and Shopping Tips\nSoups\nTurkey\nChile Pepper\nQuick Dinners"
