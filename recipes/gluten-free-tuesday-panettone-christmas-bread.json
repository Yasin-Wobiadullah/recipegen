Stir. Allow mixture to stand until yeast dissolves, about two minutes. Whisk together white rice flour and xanthan gum in a small bowl. Add water and yeast. Stir to combine. Mixture will be thick and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise overnight at room temperature.\nPrepare the Fruit:\nCombine raisins, candied orange peel, lemon zest, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Stir. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit overnight at room temperature.\nPrepare the Dough:\nIn a small bowl, stir together milk and yeast. Allow to stand for five minutes.\nIn bowl of stand mixer, whisk together brown rice flour, sorghum flour, potato starch, granulated sugar, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Add yeast mixture, egg yolks, eggs, vegetable oil and corn syrup. Mix on medium speed with flat paddle attachment until dough is thick, about three minutes.\nAdd biga. Mix for one minute to combine. Scrape down bottom and sides of bowl with rubber spatula.\nWith mixer on medium speed, add butter one tablespoon at a time. Wait for each tablespoon of butter to incorporate before adding next tablespoon.\nAfter all butter is added, mix dough for one minute. Dough should be thick and smooth. Reduce mixer speed to low and add dried fruits. Mix until fruits incorporate throughout dough.\nLightly oil medium bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Transfer dough to greased bowl.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise until doubled in size, about two to two-and-half hours.\nDeflate dough by about 75%. Do this by either punching down dough with a piece of plastic wrap between your hand and dough or stir dough using a rubber spatula.\nGenerously grease 12-inch Bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray. Spoon dough into pan and smooth top with rubber spatula.\nCover pan with greased plastic wrap and set aside until dough almost reaches top of pan, about one hour.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake loaf until internal temperature reaches 207-211\u00b0F. Loaf will be dark brown. If loaf gets too dark before internal temperature reaches 207\u00b0F, cover pan with a piece of aluminum foil and continue to bake.\nInvert loaf onto wire rack to cool. Store tightly wrapped in plastic for up to three days or freeze.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nGluten-free Breakfast & Brunch\nYeast Breads"
