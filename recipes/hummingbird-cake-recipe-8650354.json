Bake until fragrant and toasted, about 8 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then chop finely (pieces no larger than \u00bc-inch).

Drain 1 tablespoon of juice from crushed pineapple; set aside for Frosting.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nChop 2 of the bananas into small pieces (about 1 cup), and mash the other two (about 2/3 cup). Add chopped and mashed bananas to sugar mixture along with remaining crushed pineapple and its juice. Using a flexible spatula, stir to combine. In another large bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and allspice until evenly combined.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nPour sugar mixture into flour mixture and, using the same spatula, gently fold until only a few streaks of flour remain. Fold in reserved toasted chopped pecans until evenly dispersed. Divide batter evenly between prepared cake pans (about 650g or 23 ounces per pan). Gently tap pans on counter to smooth batter and release any air bubbles.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nBake until cakes are golden on top, spring back gently to the touch, and an instant read thermometer inserted in the center registers 200\u00b0F (93\u00baC), 25 to 28 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nCool cakes in their pan on a cooling rack for 10 minutes.\u00a0 Run an offset spatula or butter knife around edges of cakes, then invert cake onto a plate and transfer back to rack to cool completely, parchment-side down, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nPrepare the Frosting:\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or, using an electric hand mixer, beat cream cheese and butter on medium-low speed until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Reduce mixer speed to low, and gradually add powdered sugar, beating until fully incorporated\u00a0 after each addition. Add reserved 1 tablespoon pineapple juice and vanilla, and increase mixer speed to medium-high; beat until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nUsing a serrated knife,\nlevel cakes\nif necessary and set the scraps aside for snacking. Remove and discard parchment paper. Place 1 layer, top-side-up, on a turntable.

Top with 1 cup frosting, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with the second and third layers, placing the cake layers bottom-side up, then cover the top and sides of the cake with a very thin layer of frosting to form a\ncrumb coat\n. Refrigerate, uncovered, until frosting is mostly set, 30 to 40 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nRemove cake from refrigerator.
