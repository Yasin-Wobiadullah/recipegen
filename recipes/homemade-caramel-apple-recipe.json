In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water, sugar, and salt over medium heat. Stir with a fork until sugar is fully dissolved and syrup comes to a rolling boil, about 4 minutes. Simmer, without stirring, until syrup is honey-gold, roughly 9 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nImmediately add cream (the mixture will sputter) and reduce heat to medium-low, stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula, until caramel registers 250\u00b0F (121\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a small heat-resistant bowl and cool to about 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C).\nDip cold apples in caramel, letting excess drip off before transferring to a parchment-lined cutting board. Let stand at room temperature until fully set, about 10 minutes, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n8 to 12 wooden popsicle sticks,\n3-quart saucier\n,\nheat-resistant spatula\n,\ndigital thermometer with clip-on attachment\nNotes\nIf you have fond memories of apples dipped in the sort of super-thick and chewy caramel that can really work your jaw, reduce the cream to 6 ounces (3/4 cup; 170g). Otherwise, proceed exactly as directed.\nRead More\nCaramel Apple Crumb Bars Recipe\nTarte Tatin Recipe\nApple-Pecan Bourbon-Caramel Pie Recipe\nApple\nGluten-free Desserts\nCandy\nFall Desserts"
