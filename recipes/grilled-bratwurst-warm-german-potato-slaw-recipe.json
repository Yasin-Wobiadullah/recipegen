Cover and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grates.\nAdd the bacon to a 10-inch square disposable aluminum pan. Place over direct heat and cook, tossing occasionally, until nearly cooked through but not quite crisp. Add bell pepper, onion, and potatoes, and stir to coat. Cook until the onions are soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Pour in water and beef base and bring to a gentle boil. Add red wine vinegar and red cabbage. Top with bratwurst. The bratwursts should be slightly submerged in the liquid; if not, add more water. Return to a boil.\nSlide the tray to the cool side of the grill. Cover the grill and cook with all vents open, turning bratwursts halfway through, until bratwursts reach an internal temperature of 140 to 145\u00b0F, about 20 minutes.\nUse tongs to transfer the bratwursts from the tray to the hot side of the grill, placing them directly on the grate. Grill, turning once, until browned, about 2 minutes. Toss and season the potato slaw with salt and pepper, to taste. Return the brats to the tray and toast the buns, if desired.\nServe the bratwurst in the buns, with the potato slaw piled on. Top with parsley and mustard.\nSpecial equipment\nGrill, 10-inch square disposable aluminum baking pan\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMake Better Bratwursts With Warm German Potato Slaw\nQuick Dinners\nSausages\nPotatoes"
