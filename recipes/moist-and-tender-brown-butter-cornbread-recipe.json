Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in reserved browned butter. Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSwirl the hot skillet to coat all surfaces with melted butter. Spoon batter into skillet, smooth top lightly, then return to oven. Bake until light golden brown on top and a wooden skewer inserted into cornbread comes out with no crumbs, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then serve with extra butter and honey at the table. Leftover cornbread can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch\ncast iron skillet\nCornbread\nSoul Food & Southern\nSides\nThanksgiving Side Dishes\nJuneteenth Recipes"
