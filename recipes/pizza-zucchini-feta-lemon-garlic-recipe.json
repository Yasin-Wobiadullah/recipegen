Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking.\nCombine zucchini and minced garlic in a medium bowl. Add 1 teaspoon kosher salt and toss to coat. Transfer to a strainer and set over the bowl. Let rest for 30 minutes. Squeeze zucchini with your hands to remove all excess moisture. Transfer zucchini to a paper towel\u2013lined plate and set aside until ready to use.\nAdjust oven rack to 6 inches under broiler and place stone or steel on rack. Preheat oven to highest possible temperature (500 or 550\u00b0F; 260 or 290\u00b0C) for at least 45 minutes. Alternatively, use a\nKettlePizza and Baking Steel grill insert\n.\nWhen ready to bake, turn one dough ball out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into a rough 8-inch circle, leaving the outer 1 inch higher than the center. Gently stretch dough into a 10- to 12-inch circle, about 1/4 inch thick, by draping over knuckles and gently stretching. Transfer to floured wooden pizza peel.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPreheat broiler to high. Spread 1/4 of mozzarella over pizza, followed by a few lemon rings, 1/4 of zucchini, 1/4 of feta, and 1/4 of thinly sliced garlic. Sprinkle lightly with salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nTransfer pizza to hot stone or steel and broil, rotating regularly for even cooking, until edges are puffed and lightly charred and bottom is crisp, 3 to 6 minutes total. Retrieve pizza with a metal peel and transfer to a cutting board. Allow to rest 1 minute. Meanwhile, switch oven back to 500 or 550\u00b0F to reheat stone for remaining pizzas.\nSprinkle with scallions, slice, and serve immediately.\nRepeat steps 4 through 7 for remaining pizzas.\nSpecial Equipment\nPizza peels\n,\npizza steel\n,\npizza cutter\nRead More\nEasy Vegan Pan Pizza With Zucchini, Red Onion, and Pistachios Recipe\nCharred Kale Pizza With Garlic Recipe\nBroccoli Rabe, Pecorino, and Anchovy Pizza Recipe\nNew York-Style White Pizza Recipe\nThe Essential Tools for Homemade Pizza\nPizza\nFeta Cheese\nZucchini & Yellow Squash"
