Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes. Increase heat to high, bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by 1/4, about 20 minutes. Add heavy cream, increase heat to bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and continue to cook until reduced again by 1/4, about 20 minutes longer. Add vodka and cook for 7 minutes. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.\nLet sauce cool slightly, then transfer half of sauce to the jar of a blender. Blend, starting on lowest speed and gradually increasing to high until completely smooth, about 2 minutes total. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl. Repeat with remaining half of sauce. (For storing extra sauce, see Make-Ahead and Storage below).\nAt least 45 minutes before baking, place a baking stone or steel on an oven rack set to the top position and preheat oven to 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C).\nTurn single dough ball out onto lightly flour surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer 1-inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles into a 12 to 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.\nSpread approximately 3/4 cup of sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2 to 1-inch border along edge. Place 8 to 10 chunks of mozzarella evenly over surface of pizza and scatter with 4 to 5 basil leaves. Drizzle with about 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Slide pizza onto stone or steel and bake until cheese is melted and crust underbelly is spotty brown, 6 to 12 minutes total. Remove from oven with metal pizza peel, transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with remaining ingredients to make 2 additional pizzas.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n,\nbaking stone or steel\n,\npizza peel\nNotes\nStore-bought dough can be used in place of homemade. Use about 10 ounces of store-bought dough per pizza.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis recipe will make more sauce than is needed for three pizzas. Extra sauce can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Serve with pasta, if desired.\nRead More\nNew York-Style Pizza Recipe\nPenne alla Vodka Recipe\n11 Essential Tips for Better Pizza\nIt's Not Delivery, It's 24 Homemade Pizza Recipes\nPizza\nItalian-American\nTomato Sauces"
