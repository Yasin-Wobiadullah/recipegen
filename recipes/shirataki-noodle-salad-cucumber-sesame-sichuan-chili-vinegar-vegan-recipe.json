Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nCrush dried chiles in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder until it has the texture of store-bought crushed red pepper flakes. Place in a heatproof container along with Sichuan peppercorns. Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pour hot oil over chiles and Sichuan peppercorns (it should sizzle vigorously). Let stand 5 minutes while you prepare the rest of the sauce.\nCombine garlic, ginger, sesame paste, vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar in a large bowl and stir with a spoon to combine. Carefully pour chile-infused oil into bowl through a fine-mesh strainer (add only half of the chile sauce if you prefer a less spicy dish). Discard dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir sauce to emulsify, adding a few drops of water if it is very thick (sesame paste can vary in thickness). Add cucumbers, scallions, cilantro, sesame seeds, and drained noodles. Toss to coat, adjusting seasoning with more tahini, sugar, soy sauce, or vinegar to taste. Transfer to a serving platter, top with peanuts, and serve.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle\nor\nspice grinder\nNotes\nIf you can't find Chikiang or Chinese black vinegar, combine 2 teaspoons white vinegar with 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar in its place.\nRead More\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Shopping for Chinese Noodles\nChinese\nDairy-free Salads\nVegan Salads\nVegetarian Salads\nNoodles",
