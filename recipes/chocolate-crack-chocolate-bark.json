Use saltine pieces to fill any gaps at the bottom of the pan. Set aside.

Once butter has melted, add brown sugar and vanilla stirring to combine. Cook for about 5 minutes or until mixture is an even dark brown color and has begun to bubble. Remove from heat and pour over saltines using spatula to spread sauce.\nSerious Eats / Alexandra Penfold\nBake crackers for 5 minutes or until butter mixture begins to bubble. Remove from oven and sprinkle evenly with chocolate allowing the heat to melt the chocolate. Spread chocolate evenly with the spatula so all of the crackers are completely covered. Sprinkle with sea salt. Refrigerate until chocolate sets and hardens.
