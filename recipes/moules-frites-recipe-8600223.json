Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Stir in mussels; cover and cook over high, shaking and tossing the pot at 1 minute intervals, until mussels are opened, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat (see notes); stir in lemon zest and juice and parsley. Serve with French fries and mayonnaise.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nSpecial Equipment\n6- to 8-quart Dutch oven or large pot\nNotes\nIf mussels are gritty or have lots of beards, scrub them well under cold water and pull out beards by grabbing them and pulling towards the hinge-end of the mussels. Discard cracked or open mussels that don\u2019t close when tapped with another mussel.\nDiscard any mussels that remain unopened after cooking.\nTo toss the mussels in the pot, use your thumbs to secure the lid, and toss the pot up and down a couple of times to allow mussels on top to settle towards the base of the pan.\nMussels\nThe Latest\nQuick Dinners\nWestern European\nSeafood",
