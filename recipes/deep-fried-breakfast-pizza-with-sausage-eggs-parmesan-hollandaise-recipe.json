  "full_text": "Deep Fried Breakfast Pizza with Sausage, Eggs, Parmesan, and Hollandaise Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nActive\n90 mins\nTotal\n0 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nMakes\n4 pizzas\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n16 ounces (about 3 cups plus 2 tablespoons) bread flour, plus more for dusting\n.3 ounces (about 2 1/3 teaspoons) kosher salt, plus extra for assembly\n.2 ounces (about 1 teaspoon) active dry yeast\n11 ounces (1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons) water\n2 quarts vegetable, canola, or peanut oil\n1/2 pound raw bulk maple breakfast sausage\n4 eggs\n4 tablespoons pure maple syrup (optional)\n2 ounces grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1 recipe\nHollandaise sauce\n, warm\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves\nDirections\nCombine flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Whisk until homogenous. Add water and stir with hands until dough comes together and no dry flour remains. Knead lightly for about 30 seconds, then cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 8 to 16 hours.\nTurn dough out onto lightly floured board and using floured hands, divide into four pieces. Form each piece into a ball and place on floured board, leaving a few inches of space between each ball. Cover with plastic wrap or with a moist, clean dish towel. Let rise for two hours.\nWhen dough has risen, preheat broiler to high heat with the rack set about 6 inches below the broiler element. Place a 10-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet under the broiler. Add oil to a wide wok or Dutch oven and heat over high heat to 350\u00b0F, as registered on an instant-read or deep-fry thermometer. Adjust flame to maintain this temperature.\nOn a lightly floured bowl, stretch or roll one dough ball into a disk about 10-inches in diameter. Using your fingertips, make a dozen to 18 small holes in the stretched dough, leaving the outer 1-inch intact.\nCarefully lower dough into hot oil, using a wire mesh spider or large metal spatula to keep it submerged. Fry until puffy and lightly crisped on bottom side, about 45 seconds. Carefully flip the dough with tongs and cook until second side is crisp, about 45 seconds longer. Carefully remove hot skillet from under broiler and set on stovetop. Flip dough back over and transfer to pre-heated skillet.\nScatter 1/4 of sausage over top of pizza, leaving a 1-inch border all around and a 2-inch wide hole in the center for the egg. Make sure sausage pieces are no more than 1/4-inch in size, or they will not cook through. Break egg into center of pizza, drizzle sausage with maple syrup, then sprinkle entire pizza with 1/4 of Parmesan. Transfer to broiler and cook until edges are charred (this will happen much faster than with a normal pizza), and egg is set but still liquid in the center, about 1 1/2 minutes.\nDrizzle finished pizza with hollandaise and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately, then repeat steps 4 through 6 for remaining pizzas.\nSpecial equipment\nwok or dutch oven for deep frying\nThis Recipe Appears In\nEAT THIS NOW!: Fried Pizza with Homemade Sausage, Egg, Parmesan, and Hollandaise\nFrying"
