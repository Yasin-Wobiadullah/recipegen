Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking. Transfer tomatoes to a medium bowl and roughly crush by hand. Season to taste with salt and set aside.\nAdjust oven rack to 6 inches under broiler and place baking stone or baking steel on rack. Preheat oven to highest possible temperature (500 or 550\u00b0F; 260\u00b0C or 290\u00b0C) for at least 45 minutes. Alternatively, use\nKettle Pizza and Baking Steel grill insert.\nWhen ready to bake, turn single dough ball out onto lightly flour surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer 1-inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough into a 10 to 12-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick by draping over knuckles and gently stretching. Transfer to floured wooden pizza peel.\nPreheat broiler to high. Spread thin layer of sauce over pizza, followed by 1/4 of mozzarella. Spread 1/4 of sausage over pizza in small chunks. Spread 1/4 of radicchio and 1/4 of parmesan evenly over pizza. Sprinkle lightly with salt, add 6 basil leaves, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil.\nTransfer pizza to hot stone or steel and broil until edges are puffed and lightly charred and bottom is crisp, rotating regularly for even cooking, 3 to 6 minutes total. Retrieve pizza with a metal peel and transfer to a cutting board. Slice and serve immediately. Meanwhile, switch oven back to 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C) to reheat stone for remaining pizzas.\nRepeat steps 3 through 5 for remaining pizzas.\nSpecial Equipment\nWood and metal\npizza peels\n;\nbaking steel\nor\nbaking stone\n;\npizza cutter\nRead More\nGrilled Trevisano or Radicchio With Gorgonzola, Olive Oil, and Saba Recipe\nCharred Kale Pizza With Garlic Recipe\nOutdoor Pizza Oven Charred Broccoli Rabe and Anchovy Pizza Recipe\nCaramelized Broccoli and Red Onion Pizza Recipe\nHow to Make Great Pizza in an Outdoor Pizza Oven\nPizza\nItalian-American\nBread\nSausages\nEndive, Radicchio & Chicories"
