Bring to a boil and immediately reduce to below a simmer. Cook for about half an hour, adding small pinches of salt to taste, or until base tastes like bright mint. Do not cook base longer than 45 minutes, or \"cooked\" flavors will develop.\nRemove from heat and strain into a wide, shallow container, pressing against mint with a spoon. Add lime juice, a few drops at a time, to taste, and any additional salt needed. Place container in freezer. After 1 to 1 1/2 hours, break up any large ice crystals with a fork, scraping along edges of container. Repeat scraping every 45 minutes, until no liquid remains and granita has frozen into flaky shards of ice.\nMint\nSummer Desserts",
