Turn the dough out into a large bowl (and soak that pot immediately to help with clean up!).\nAllow the dough to cool just slightly for a few minutes. Then, adding one egg at a time, stir the eggs into the dough with a wooden spoon. It is vigorous work, but at the end, you will have a sticky dough.\nStir in the cheese and the pink peppercorns, and fully incorporate.\nUse a medium-sized ice cream scoop to make balls of the dough. Line them up on a Silpat-lined baking sheet, leaving some room between them to allow them to puff up. Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees F.\nAfter 10 minutes, lower the heat to 350 degrees F, and bake another 35 to 40 minutes, until hard to the touch. Pull them out of the oven, and let them sit for 10 minutes on the baking sheet. Then, allow them to cool further on a cooling rack. Eat warm or at room temperature.\nSavory\nFrench\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nPastries\nParmesan"
