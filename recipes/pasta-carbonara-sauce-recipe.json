Add pasta and cook, stirring, until al dente.\nMeanwhile, combine guanciale (or pancetta or bacon) with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a large skillet and cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat, until fat has rendered and guanciale is crisp, about 7 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nIn a large, metal heatproof mixing bowl, whisk together whole eggs and yolks, Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and black pepper.\nVicky Wasik\nUsing tongs and/or a strainer, transfer pasta to skillet with crisped guanciale and its fat; be sure not to drain boiling pasta water. Add remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil to pasta and stir to combine; let cool slightly. Scrape pasta, pork, and all the fat into the egg mixture. Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta-cooking water and add to pasta and egg mixture. Stir well to combine.\nVicky Wasik\nSet mixing bowl over pot of boiling pasta water (make sure bottom of bowl does not touch the water) and cook, stirring quickly with tongs, until sauce thickens to a creamy, silky consistency and leaves trails as you stir. Remove from heat, season with salt if needed, and divide into bowls. Serve right away, topping with more grated cheese and freshly ground pepper as desired.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge, metal heatproof mixing bowl\n(large enough to nest on top of the pasta pot without the bottom touching the boiling water)\nNotes\nRemember not to oversalt your pasta water; you'll add some of it to your sauce, which will already have salty ingredients. Feel free to substitute another dried pasta, such as penne, if desired. Guanciale, cured pork jowl, is generally considered the most authentic choice here; it's fattier than pancetta or bacon and often more heavily spiced, creating a pasta with pronounced spice notes and an extra-unctuous texture. Pancetta delivers the cleanest porky flavor, while American bacon, though less traditional, adds a hit of pleasant smoke. Use whichever you prefer.\nItalian\nStovetop Pasta\nParmesan\nPecorino\nEggs"
