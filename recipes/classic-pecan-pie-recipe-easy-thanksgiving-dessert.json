Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of the pie dough until it overhangs the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of pie dough down, tucking it under itself, working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges. If a well-done crust is desired, you may chill and\nblind bake\nit before proceeding.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together eggs, honey, corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, salt, and vanilla. Whisk for approximately 30 seconds, until the mixture is homogenous and slightly frothy.\nKeep whisking until the mixture is homogenous and a little bit frothy. This will help incorporate air into it so that the filling strikes a balance between gooey and light.\n.\nLine pie crust with chopped pecans, reserving the whole ones. Press down slightly so chopped pecans embed in the dough. Pour the filling mixture over the pecans, then gently place the whole pecans in concentric circles on the top, taking care not to press too hard, which will cause the nuts to sink into the filling.\nBake pie for 40 minutes, rotating halfway through baking. Continue baking, shielding the exposed nuts with aluminum foil if they threaten to burn (see instructions for fashioning a foil shield above). When finished, the filling should be slightly jiggly, but mostly set and puffed slightly, about 1 hour total. The filling should register between 175 and 180\u00b0F (79 to 82\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours and up to overnight before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n9 inch pie plate,\ninstant-read thermometer\n(optional)\nRead More\nA Crash Course in Mastering Pie Dough\nMission Impossible?
