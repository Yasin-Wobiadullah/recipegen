Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to sealed container. Shake vigorously to emulsify before each use.\nSpecial Equipment\nMicroplane or other rasp-style grater\n,\nsqueeze bottle\n(optional)\nNotes\nThis recipe can easily be scaled up or down. If you have plastic squeeze bottles, there's no need to first whisk in a bowl\u2014construct the dressing in the bottles using the same ratio of ingredients, scaling down to fit in one bottle. Cover the top and shake before each use.\nNote that if the garlic and shallot are not minced finely enough, they can clog the spout of a squeeze bottle. You can widen the spout by cutting it (the hole gets larger the closer you cut it to the bottle), but you should still endeavor to mince very finely, or grate with the Microplane.\nMeak-Ahead and Storage\nThe dressing can be refrigerated for up to 1 week (storing raw garlic in oil carries the serious risk of botulism; the cold temperature of a refrigerator combined with the presence of vinegar in the dressing helps reduce that risk, but we still do not recommend storing this vinaigrette longer than 1 week).\nSalad Dressing",
