  "full_text": "Pasta with Clams and Anchovies Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n30 mins\nActive\nAbout 30 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nSalt\n1\npound\ngluten-free spaghetti\n1/2\ncup\nolive oil\n4\ncloves\ngarlic\n, minced or put through a garlic press\n1\nsmall\nonion\n, finely diced\n1\nteaspoon\ndried parsley\n1\nteaspoon\ndried oregano\n2\ncans (6.25 ounces\neach) chopped clams, or\n1\ncan (10 ounces\n)\nwhole baby clams\n2\njars (2.5 ounces\neach)\nanchovy fillets\n, minced with oil reserved\nDirections\nFill a large pot three-quarters full with water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Set a colander in the sink for draining the pasta.\nWhen the water reaches a boil, add 1 tablespoon salt and the pasta. Stir with a wooden spoon for about 30 seconds, then stir occasionally while the pasta cooks.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, begin the sauce. In a small pot, combine the oil and garlic. Turn on the heat to medium-low (Yes, start the garlic in cold oil. You want to cook it very gently.) When the garlic begins to sizzle, add the onion, parsley, and oregano. Cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the onions are translucent. Lower the heat to low. (This is a good time to check the pasta if you haven't already.)\nAdd the clams and their juices and the minced anchovies and their oil to the olive oil mixture and heat through. Don't let the sauce boil, or the clams will get tough.\nAfter about 10 minutes of boiling, check the pasta for doneness. When the pasta is tender, ladle out about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water into a small heatproof bowl and set aside. Drain the pasta in the colander and return it to its pot over very low heat. Add the sauce to the pasta and toss with a wooden spoon. If the pasta seems dry, add a little of the pasta cooking water; stir in 1/4 cup to start, adding more if needed. Serve immediately.\nPasta Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop Pasta\nClams\nAnchovies",
