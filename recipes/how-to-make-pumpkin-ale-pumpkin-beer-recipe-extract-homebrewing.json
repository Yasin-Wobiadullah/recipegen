Place the bag in 5.5 gallons of water in a 7.5-gallon pot and immerse the grain.\nBegin to heat, making sure mesh bag isn\u2019t sitting directly on the bottom of the pot. Remove grain bag when temperature reaches 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C).\nBring wort to a vigorous boil. As water is heating, slowly add 4.8 pounds of light dry malt extract and baked pumpkin, stirring constantly until completely dissolved. When the boil begins, add 1/2 ounce Northern Brewer hops in a mesh bag.\nAfter a total of 55 minutes has passed, add maple syrup and pumpkin pie spice.\nAfter total of 60 minutes of boil, remove from heat.\nWarning:\nAfter wort cools below 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C) everything that touches it should be sanitary, and exposure to open air should be limited as much as possible.\nCool wort by placing pot in ice bath or by using a wort chiller until it is at 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C). Transfer to a sanitized fermentor (either a carboy or a fermentation bucket).\nUse a sanitized auto-siphon racking cane to remove enough wort to take a gravity reading with your hydrometer. Make a note of this number, since you will be using it to calculate the actual alcohol content when it's done fermenting. The reading should be around 1.057. Cover fermentor with a sanitized stopper and airlock.\nAgitate vigorously for at least 5 minutes or aerate using pure oxygen for 1 minute. Add 1 package of Safale US-05.\nFerment for at least 14 days at 64 to 68\u00b0F (18 to 20\u00b0C).\nBottle after conditioning is complete,\nusing enough priming sugar for a medium level of carbonation.\nSpecial Equipment\n7.5 gallon kettle (or bigger),\nbasic homebrewing equipment setup\nRead More\nHomebrewing: Introduction to Mashing and All-Grain Brewing\nThe Smokin' Pumpkin Recipe\nBeer\nPumpkin\nHalloween"
