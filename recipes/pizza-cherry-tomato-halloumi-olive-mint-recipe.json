Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking.\nAdjust oven rack to 6 inches under broiler and place stone or steel on rack.

Gently press out dough into a rough 8-inch circle, leaving the outer 1 inch higher than the center. Gently stretch dough into a 10- to 12-inch circle, about 1/4 inch thick, by draping over knuckles and gently stretching. Transfer to floured wooden pizza peel.\nPreheat broiler to high.

Sprinkle lightly with salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nTransfer pizza to hot stone or steel and broil, rotating regularly for even cooking, until edges are puffed and lightly charred and bottom is crisp, 3 to 6 minutes total.
