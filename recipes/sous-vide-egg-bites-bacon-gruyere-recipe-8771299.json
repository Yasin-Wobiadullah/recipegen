Set circulator to 172\u00b0F (78\u00b0C), and allow water bath to come up to temperature.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nOnce water reaches temperature, process eggs, cottage cheese, Gruy\u00e8re, Monterey Jack, rice starch, hot sauce, and salt in a blender on medium speed until smooth, about 25 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nDivide bacon among five 4-ounce canning jars with lids and bands. Pour blended egg mixture evenly over bacon mixture in jars. Cover with metal lids and screw on bands until just fingertip tight (i.e., only as tight at you can get the jars using just your fingertips). Do not screw on too tight.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nUsing tongs, carefully lower jars into the water bath and cook for 1 hour.\u00a0Use tongs to transfer jars to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Carefully remove the lids. The egg bites can be served directly out of the jar, or run a knife along the edges of the jars to loosen the egg bites and invert onto a small plate before serving.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion circulator\n; plastic container such as a Cambro, large Dutch oven, or large pot; Five 4-ounce canning jars with lids and bands; tongs; wire rack\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nRefrigerate egg bites in their cooking jars or an airtight container for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 1 month.
