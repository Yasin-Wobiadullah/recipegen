Carefully rinse and pat dry all the pigs' tails. Gently slip them into the oil and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until the tails are golden brown.\nPlace the tails into a braising pot and cover with water. Add the garlic, onion, soy sauce, wine, and salt. Simmer for an hour, and let cool. Reserve the stock for another use.\nReheat the oil until it is 350\u00b0F. Pat the tails dry with a paper towel or clean cloth, taking care that no residual stock is sticking to the surface. Roll each tail segment around in the flour, until it is evenly coated.\nWith one hand, very quickly slip the tail segments into the pot, using your other hand to maneuver the lid of the pot as you go along. Fry for another 3 minutes, until the tails are golden brown and crisped.\nTossing evenly, dress the tails in a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar with salt and pepper to taste. The tails will have absorbed only a bit of the dressing, but it is enough. Have a bit of the dressing handy on the side, for dipping.\nPork\nFrying"
