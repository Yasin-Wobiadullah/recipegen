Place ham in an oven bag or wrap tightly with foil and place on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to oven and cook until ham reaches 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) in the center, about 2 1/2 hours.\nMeanwhile, combine maple syrup, molasses, mustard, and cinnamon in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick and syrupy, about 15 minutes.\nWhen ham has reached 120\u00b0F, remove from oven and unwrap. Paint with 1/3 of sauce, increase oven temperature to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C), and bake 5 minutes. Paint with 1/3 more glaze and bake until crisp and shiny, 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven and paint with remaining glaze. Tent with foil and allow to rest 15 minutes before slicing and serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nWire rack\n, rimmed baking sheet,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nFor best results, look for a bone-in, shank-end, spiral-sliced ham with no added water.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Hams\nChristmas Dinners\nChristmas\nThanksgiving\nAmerican\nRoasted Pork"
