Stir to mix thoroughly and refrigerate until ready to use.\nFor the Latkes:\nWorking in roughly 2-cup batches, wrap beets, potatoes, and onions in cheesecloth that has been folded over twice. Tie corners around the handle of a wooden spoon and twist bundle until liquid flows out and vegetables are dry. Add squeezed vegetables to a large mixing bowl and toss to combine thoroughly.\nAdd garlic and walnuts and stir to combine. Mix in eggs and matzo meal. You should be able to form patties that just stick together in your hands; if the mixture is too wet, add more matzo meal, 1 tablespoon at a time, until patties can be properly formed. Stir in salt and pepper.\nFill a cast iron skillet with 1/2 inch oil and heat over medium-high heat until a shred of potato immediately bubbles when dropped in. Form a small amount of latke mixture into a disk and fry on both sides until golden brown to test for seasoning. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.\nForm patties about 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick in the center and slide patties into pan (no more than 4 at a time). Fry until a golden-brown crust forms on bottom, then flip using a slotted spatula and fork and fry until golden brown on other side and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes per side. If a darker crust is desired, continue cooking on each side to desired doneness.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer latkes to a baking sheet lined with paper towels and let cool for 2 minutes. Serve with applesauce and horseradish sour cream at the table.\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron skillet\n,\nfood processor\n, cheesecloth,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nThe exact amount of matzo meal needed will depend on how moist your vegetables are. Start with the suggested amount, then add more if needed, working in 1-tablespoon increments, until you can form patties that stick together in your hands.\nRead More\nOld-Fashioned Latkes\nSpiced Sweet Potato, Carrot, and Acorn Squash Latkes\nZucchini Latkes With Parmesan, Pine Nuts, and Basil\nVegetarian\nBeets\nPotatoes\nHanukkah",
