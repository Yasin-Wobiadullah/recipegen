Tradition dictates that the drink be shaken very hard for at least one and preferably two full minutes with ice. You can cheat by either whisking the mixture with a milk-frother or whisk (or tossing a spring from a Hawthorne strainer into the shaker and using that to whip the ingredients) until foamy, and then shaking with ice for a good 20 seconds, or you can buckle down and take the fully authentic ride, while working off the calories you\u2019ll be taking in from the cream and sugar. Strain into a chilled Collins glass and add an ounce or two of chilled seltzer, to taste.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nSpecial equipment\nCocktail shaker, cocktail strainer\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCelebrate Spring With an Egg in Your Cocktail\nGin"
