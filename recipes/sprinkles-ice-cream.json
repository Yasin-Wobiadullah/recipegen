Turn off heat, stir in cereal, cover, and let steep for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until the mixture lightens in color and is fully combined.\nPour cereal-dairy mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl. Push on cereal mush with a spoon to extract as much as much dairy as possible, but don't press flakes of cereal through the strainer. Discard cereal. Strained dairy should yield 3 cups; measure out that amount, adding more cream and milk in a 2 to 1 ratio if needed.\nQuickly pour dairy into saucepan with egg yolks and sugar, whisking rapidly to completely combine. Place pot over medium-low heat and cook, whisking frequently, until a custard forms on a spoon and a finger swiped across the back leaves a clean line, or until custard temperature reaches 170\u00b0F (76\u00b0C). Stir in salt to taste.\nStrain custard through a fine-mesh strainer and either chill in ice bath or in refrigerator until it is very cold, about 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Churn in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions, adding in sprinkles during last minute of churn, then transfer to an airtight container and chill in freezer for at least 4 hours.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nIce Cream\nNorth American"
