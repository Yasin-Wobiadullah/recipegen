Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly but gently, until warm, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium and continue whisking until thick and steaming hot, about 3 minutes longer. When the custard begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for exactly 30 seconds to neutralize a starch-dissolving enzyme found in egg yolks.\nStrain into a non-reactive container, then whisk in cream and liqueur, if using. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40\u00b0F, then churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer.\nWhen ice cream looks thick and light, shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape ice cream into the chilled container. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until firm. If desired, serve with\nroasted strawberries\nor\nMeyer lemon chantilly\n.\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier,\nnon-reactive sieve\n, stainless steel mixing bowl, ice cream maker, non-reactive, freezer-safe container\nNotes\nYou can zest and juice the lemons right before making the ice cream, or up to 3 days in advance; combine and refrigerate in a nonreactive, airtight container until ready to use. If you like, save the leftover rinds to make a Meyer lemon variation of\nfresh lemon syrup\n.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMeyer Lemon Ice Cream That's as Easy as Pie\nIce Cream\nLemon\nHeavy Cream\nEaster Desserts\nMother's Day",
