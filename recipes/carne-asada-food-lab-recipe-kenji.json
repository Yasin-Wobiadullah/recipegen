Transfer to the jar of a blender and add chipotle peppers, orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, cilantro, garlic, cumin seed, and coriander seed. Blend until a smooth sauce has formed, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Transfer half of the salsa to a large bowl and the other half to a sealed container. Set aside the sealed container in the refrigerator.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd an extra 2 teaspoons of salt to the salsa in the bowl. It should taste slightly saltier than is comfortable to taste. Add 1 piece of steak to bowl and turn to coat. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with the top folded over to prevent excess sauce and meat juices from contaminating the seal. Repeat with remaining steaks, adding them all to the same bag. Pour any excess marinade over the steaks. Squeeze all air out of the bag and seal. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nWhen ready to cook, remove the extra salsa from the fridge to allow it to warm up a little.\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes.\nClean and oil\nthe grilling grate.\nRemove steaks from marinade and wipe off excess. Place directly over the hot side of the grill. If using a gas grill, cover; if using a charcoal grill, leave exposed. Cook, turning occasionally, until steaks are well charred on outside and center registers 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly against the grain and serve immediately, passing extra salsa, lime wedges, avocado, onions, cilantro, and tortillas on the side.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\ngrill\n,\nchimney starter\n(optional),\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nI like ancho and guajillo chiles here, but a mix of chiles such as negro, pasilla, and California can be used in their place. An equivalent weight of hanger or flap steak can be used in place of skirt steak.\nRead More\nKnife Skills: How to Trim Skirt Steaks\nMission-Style Carne Asada Burrito Recipe\nGrilled Skirt Steak Fajitas Recipe\nSheet-Pan Skirt Steak Fajitas Recipe\nChurrasco Steak Recipe\nGrilled Skirt Steak With Mojo Marinade Recipe\nSkirt Steaks\nGrilled Beef\nMexican\nChile Pepper\nBeef Mains",
