Whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, combine almond milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and vinegar in a bowl. Add dry mix to wet mix and fold with a rubber spatula to combine (the mixture should remain lumpy). Fold in whipped chickpea liquid, being careful not to let it deflate too much.\nHeat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of vegan butter or oil to skillet or griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Reduce heat to low. Use a 1/4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip pancakes and cook on second side until golden brown and completely set, about 3 minutes longer. Serve pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and vegan butter.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\nor\nhand mixer\n.\nPancakes\nVegan Breakfast & Brunch\nChickpeas\nEaster\nMother's Day",
