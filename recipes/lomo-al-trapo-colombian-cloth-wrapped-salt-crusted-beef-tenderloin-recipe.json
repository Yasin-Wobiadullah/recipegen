Lay it on your work surface, with the short edge parallel to the counter edge. Spread a layer of salt at least 1/2 inch thick on the towel, starting about 1 inch up from the leading edge and progressing back about 12 inches, leaving a 2-inch space on either side. Scatter with herbs and place beef directly on the salt on the edge closest to you.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nCarefully roll the beef up until it is completely surrounded in salt. Tuck the leading side of the towel into the roll, fold in the sides to form a neat package, then continue rolling until the beef is completely wrapped in the towel.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nUsing butcher's twine, secure the package at 1- to 2-inch intervals, tying as tightly as possible.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPlace beef directly on coals. Partially cover grill and cook for 10 minutes. Flip beef and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the package registers 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C) for rare or 105\u00b0F (41\u00b0C) for medium-rare. (I do not advise cooking for longer than that if you want juicy meat.) Transfer the whole package to a metal tray or pan and let rest until the core reaches 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) for rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium-rare, about 10 to 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nWhen ready to serve, carefully crack open the crust with the back of a knife, reserve some of the smoky salt for serving, and discard the burnt cloth and remaining salt. Use the back of your knife or a pastry brush to remove any excess salt. Slice tenderloin and serve with\naj\u00ed\nor\nchimichurri\nas desired.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nClean cotton dish towel, butcher's twine,\ncharcoal grill\nor fireplace\nNotes\nA quadruple layer of cheesecloth can be used in place of the cotton dish towel in this recipe.\nRead More\nHow to Trim a Whole Beef Tenderloin for Roasting\nSlow-Roasted Beef Tenderloin\nHow to Grill-Roast a Whole Beef Tenderloin\nSalt-Baked Whole Fish With Fresh Herbs\nColombian-Style Salt-Crusted New Potatoes\nBeef Mains\nColombian\nGrilled Beef\nTenderloin Steak\nFather's Day"
