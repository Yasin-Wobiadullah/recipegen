Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking.\nAdjust oven rack to 6 inches under broiler and place stone or steel on rack. Preheat oven to highest possible temperature (500 or 550\u00b0F; 260 or 290\u00b0C) for at least 45 minutes.\nWhen ready to bake, turn single dough ball out onto lightly flour surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer 1-inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough into a 12 to 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick by draping over knuckles and gently stretching. Transfer to floured wooden pizza peel.\nPreheat broiler to high. Spread 1/3 of mozzarella and 1/3 of of romano evenly over surface. Spread a dozen clams over surface, making sure that the joint side is facing down. Scatter 4 to 5 basil leaves, 1/2 teaspoon pepper flakes, and sliced garlic over the top. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nTransfer pizza to hot stone or steel and broil until edges are puffed and lightly charred, bottom is crisp, and clams have started to crack open, 3 to 6 minutes. Retrieve pizza with a metal peel and transfer to a cutting board. Allow to rest 1 minute. Meanwhile, switch oven back to 500 or 550\u00b0F to reheat stone for remaining pizzas.\nUsing a thin offset metal spatula or a butter knife, finish prying open clams, discarding any that have remained completely closed. Shuck meat and pour meat and juices into wells left by shells. Cut pizza and serve immediately with lemon wedges.\nRepeat steps 3 through 6 for remaining pizzas.\nSpecial Equipment\nWood and metal\npizza peels\n,\nbaking stone\nor\nbaking steel\n,\npizza cutter\nRead More\nHow to Make Great Pizza in an Outdoor Pizza Oven\nThe Essential Tools for Homemade Pizza\nA Pizza Snob's Approach To Toppings\nNew York-Style White Pizza Recipe\nPizza\nItalian\nClams"
