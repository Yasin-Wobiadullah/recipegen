Cook, stirring frequently, until apples begin to break down into something like applesauce, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook until apples become a relatively smooth sauce that can be dragged across the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add 1/4 cup sugar, increase heat to high, and cook until apples turn a dark caramel color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid burning.\nSerious Eats / Max Falkowitz\nTransfer apples to a blender and add evaporated milk. Pur\u00e9e for 30 seconds until very smooth. Set saucepan aside to cool.\nWhisk together egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in a saucepan until well combined, then whisk in apple pur\u00e9e, cream, cinnamon, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook on medium heat, whisking frequently to dissolve browned pits in bottom of pan, until a custard forms on the back of a spoon but a swiped finger leaves a clean line, 10 to 15 minutes.\nPour custard through a strainer into an airtight container, cover, and chill overnight or at least 6 hours. The next day, churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer back to airtight container, quickly stir in tea biscuits, and chill in freezer for at least 3 hours before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nice cream maker\nRead More\nA Pie Cream Thanksgiving\n10 Ice Cream Recipes That Use Fall and Winter Fruit\nIce Cream\nAmerican\nApple\nFall Desserts"
