In a small sauce pot, combine the palm sugar with 1 cup (240ml) water and heat, stirring occasionally, just until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in the gelatin mixture and tamarind concentrate. Add an additional 8 ounces (240g) ice by weight or 1 cup of ice water by volume to dilute and chill the popsicle base.\nDivide evenly among 10 (3-fluid-ounce) popsicle molds and freeze until just beginning to firm, about 30 minutes. Insert popsicle sticks and continue freezing until completely solid, about 8 hours. To un-mold, dunk molds in hot tap water for a few seconds and jiggle sticks to release. Wrap individually in plastic and freeze for up to 3 weeks.\nFor the chili salt, in a small bowl combine the cayenne, sugar, salt, and malic acid. Dip the edge of each popsicle into the chili salt before serving.\nNotes\nMalic acid is a natural fruit acid. It has a softer acidity than citric acid, providing just enough tart punch without actually punching you in the mouth.\nSpecial Equipment\nPopsicle molds\nThis Recipe Appears In\nChili Salt Makes These Tamarind Popsicles a Grown-Up Treat\nPopsicles\nGluten-free Desserts\nVegan Desserts\nSummer Desserts",
