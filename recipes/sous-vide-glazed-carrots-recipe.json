Place carrots, butter, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a vacuum bag and seal according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook carrots in the water bath until fully tender, about 1 hour. At this point, carrots can be stored in refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nEmpty entire contents of bag into a 12-inch, heavy-bottomed skillet and cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until liquid has reduced to a shiny glaze, about 2 minutes. If glaze breaks and turns greasy, add water a teaspoon at a time, shaking pan to re-form glaze. Season to taste with salt and pepper, stir in parsley, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nSpecial Equipment\nSous vide immersion circulator\nCarrots\nSous Vide\nThanksgiving Side Dishes\nEaster Side Dishes\nChristmas Sides"
