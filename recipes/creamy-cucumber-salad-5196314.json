Discard any accumulated liquid and wipe out bowl.\nLynn Wolsted\nIn now-empty bowl, add tahini and lemon juice and whisk to combine; the mixture will seize and turn pasty. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons cold water and whisk until a smooth sauce forms. Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, lemon zest, dill, garlic, and shallot, and whisk to combine. The sauce should very slowly lose its shape if you let ribbons of it drop from the whisk into the bowl (if sauce is too thick, whisk in cold water in 1/4-teaspoon increments to achieve desired consistency).\nLynn Wolsted\nAdd cucumber spears and toss until evenly coated with sauce. Transfer to a serving plate, garnish with dill, and serve.\nLynn Wolsted\nNotes\nTo substitute English or cocktail cucumbers, replace with an equal amount by weight. Trim ends and cut into 3- by 5/8-inch wide spears.\nMake-ahead and Storage\nTahini sauce can be prepared in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.\nThe cucumber salad can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
