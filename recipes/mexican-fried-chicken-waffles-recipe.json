Toss to coat, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.\nIn a wide, shallow bowl, combine cornmeal, masa harina, flour, baking powder, ancho chile powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, granulated onion, black pepper, sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt and whisk until thoroughly mixed. Drain chicken, reserving buttermilk marinade in bowl. Working with one piece at a time, roll chicken in the dry mixture to coat. Return chicken to buttermilk marinade, then coat once more in dry mixture. Transfer chicken to a wire rack set above a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken, then let stand 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nIn a large wok or cast iron skillet, heat 2 inches of oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Working in batches and turning occasionally, fry the chicken until exterior is deep golden-brown and the internal temperature registers 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes. Oil temperature will drop when you add chicken, so adjust heat to maintain 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) frying temperature during cooking. Transfer fried chicken to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to absorb excess oil. After draining, transfer chicken to a clean wire rack set over a clean baking sheet. Let cool to room temperature; set frying oil aside.\nFor the Waffles:\nIn a large bowl, whisk together buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter. In a separate large bowl, whisk together flour, masa harina, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Fold in peppers and let stand for 10 minutes.\nPreheat the waffle iron to moderate setting and spray both sides with nonstick cooking spray. Pour batter to nearly fill the bottom half of the waffle iron and cook until golden-brown. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat until all of the waffles have been cooked, then tent with foil to keep warm.\nFor the Honey-Ancho Bacon:\nPreheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and arrange bacon in a single layer. In a small bowl, combine honey and ancho chile powder. Set aside. Bake bacon until beginning to crisp, about 10 minutes, then brush liberally with the honey-ancho mixture and continue to bake until crisp and caramelized, 5-10 minutes longer. Transfer bacon to a wire rack to cool. Reduce oven to 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C) and transfer waffles to oven to keep warm until ready to serve.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nTo Serve:\nReheat frying oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and quickly fry chicken to reheat, about 2 minutes; transfer chicken to clean paper towels to drain.\nTransfer waffles to plates. Spread guacamole on top, then arrange bacon over guacamole. Crown with fried chicken pieces. Spoon salsa roja on top and drizzle with crema. Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nWaffle iron\n,\nwok\nor\ncast iron skillet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n, 3\nrimmed baking sheets\n, 2\nwire racks\nNotes\nMasa harina is a flour made from nixtamalized corn and used to make tortillas and tamales. It can be found in most well-stocked supermarkets and Latin groceries.\nRead More\nOvernight Brown-Butter Yeast-Raised Waffles\nBacon, Cheese, and Scallion Waffles\nHerb Waffles with Sausage, Peppers, and a Fried Egg\nExtra-Crispy Fried Chicken With Caramelized Honey and Spice\nThe Best Buttermilk-Brined Southern Fried Chicken\nWaffles\nMexican\nFried Chicken\nChicken Thighs\nEaster",
