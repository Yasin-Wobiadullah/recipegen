You can either proceed with the rest of the recipe right away, or, if you have time, place both cuts on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for up to 2 days. (Pre-salting the fresh cuts of pork will season them deeply and help them retain juiciness later.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPreheat oven to 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C). In a large Dutch oven, heat 1/4 cup (60ml) goose fat (or duck fat, lard, or oil) over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 10 minutes.\nAdd wine, stock, and cheesecloth sachet to onions. Nestle pork shoulder, slab bacon, and ham hock in onions and braising liquids and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cut a\nparchment paper lid\nsized to fit Dutch oven and set directly on top of meats and liquid. Transfer to oven and cook for 1 1/2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, Cook Pork Loin:\nPlace pork loin in a small ovenproof skillet or on a rimmed baking sheet and cook on a separate rack in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C), about 1 hour. Set aside.\nMeanwhile, Prepare Salt Pork (if using):\nFill a large saucepan with water, add salt pork, and bring to a gentle simmer. Continue to cook at a very gentle simmer for 1 hour, then transfer salt pork to Dutch oven for remainder of cooking time.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, Prepare Sauerkraut:\nIn a colander, lightly rinse sauerkraut under cold running water, then taste; depending on how much of its sour flavor you want to preserve, you can stop here or continue to rinse until desired flavor is reached. (This will depend on the age and flavor of the sauerkraut and your personal preference.) Using your hands, squeeze sauerkraut dry of excess water.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAfter meats in Dutch oven have cooked for 1 1/2 hours, per instructions in step 3, add sauerkraut to Dutch oven, mixing it into braising liquids and meats. Raise oven temperature to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C), re-cover with parchment paper lid, and cook until meats are very tender, about 1 hour longer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Finish the Dish:\nFill a large saucepan with water and bring to a bare simmer over medium-high heat. Add sausages, lower heat to maintain a bare simmer, and cook until heated through, about 10 minutes. Keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a skillet, heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) fat or oil over high heat until shimmering. Add reserved pork loin from step 4 and sear, turning often, until well browned all over, about 3 minutes per side. Slice into medallions.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRemove parchment paper lid from Dutch oven and add pork loin medallions, smoked pork chops, and potatoes. Return to oven and cook until chops and loin are just heated through, 10 to 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRemove all meats from Dutch oven and set aside on a clean rimmed baking sheet. Discard cheesecloth sachet. Season sauerkraut with salt and stir in kirsch, if using. Using a slotted spoon, heap sauerkraut onto a large warmed serving platter, allowing any excess juices to drain off and arranging potatoes throughout. Drain poached sausages. Arrange meats and sausages all over mound of sauerkraut and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven\n,\nparchment paper\n,\ncheesecloth\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\n(if pre-salting fresh meats)\nNotes\nAn Alsatian white wine, like Silvaner, Riesling, or Pinot Gris, would traditionally be used in this dish. However, the flavor difference that results from using other dry white wines, while noticeable in side-by-side tests, is subtle. You can use any dry white wine here that you prefer, though it's best to find one without too much oaky flavor.\nRead More\nHomemade Sauerkraut\nThe Best Way to Grill Sausages\nHow to Make a Parchment Paper Lid for Stews and Braises\nPork\nFrench\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nBacon\nSausages"
