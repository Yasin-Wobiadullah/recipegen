Cover with 5 cups (1.2L) cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until beans are just tender, about 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd coconut milk, ginger (if using), scallions, thyme, Scotch bonnet pepper, and allspice seeds. Season with pepper. Return to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd rice and stir once to distribute. Cover, lower heat to low, and cook until all water is absorbed and rice is fully cooked, 20 minutes or following the cooking time on rice package directions. Without lifting the lid, let rice continue to steam, covered, for 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFluff rice and discard Scotch bonnet pepper, thyme sprigs, and scallions, if you can find them (it's also okay to leave some of these in the pot, we often do, allowing diners to pluck them out at the table). Serve directly from the pot or transfer to a serving dish; note that it's okay if the rice crisps on the bottom of the pot, in Jamaica this crispy bottom is called bun bun, and it is often desired.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge heavy-bottomed pot\nNotes\nYou can also substitute pigeon peas (\u201cgungu peas\u201d) for a different version of Jamaican peas and rice.\nJamaican\nThe Latest\nRice & Grain Mains\nVegetarian\nVegan",
