Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned around the edges, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ketchup, apple juice, brown sugar, honey, vinegar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, soy sauce, and hot sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nPuree sauce with an immersion blender, or transfer sauce to the jar of a standard blender, and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. If not using right away, transfer to a jar and store in refrigerator.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nFire up\nsmoker\nor\ngrill\nto 225\u00b0F (105\u00b0C). Add wood chunk to smoker following manufacturer's instructions, or set wood chunk on top of embers if using a grill. Place chickens in smoker or on grill over indirect heat, and cook until breast meat registers 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove from smoker and let chickens rest until cool enough to handle.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nUsing hands or two forks, pull chicken into thin strands, discarding skin, cartilage, and excess fat.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nMeasure out 3/4 cup of barbecue sauce and set aside. Reheat remaining barbecue sauce in a large saupan. Stir shredded chicken into hot barbecue sauce and cook until chicken is warmed throughout.
