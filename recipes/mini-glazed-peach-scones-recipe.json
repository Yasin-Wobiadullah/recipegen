Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Dice butter then place in a bowl and put in the freezer for 2 minutes.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add butter to bowl and using a pastry cutter or finger tips, cut butter into flour until it's the size of peas (see note).\nIn a small bowl, whisk together eggs and heavy cream. Add to dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Turn dough out onto a well floured work surface. Pat down into a long, flat rectangle, about 12-by 5-inches.\nSprinkle peaches on top of dough, then fold dough in on itself. Continue to fold until peaches are evenly distributed throughout the dough. Pat dough down into a 12- by 5-inch rectangle.\nCut dough in half lengthwise, and then in quarters vertically, creating 2 1/2- by 3-inch rectangles. Cut each of those rectangles in half diagonally, creating small triangles. Place triangular scones on baking sheet and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool.\nIn a small bowl, combine confectioner's sugar and water and whisk until smooth. Drizzle each scone with glaze.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor, baking sheets, pastry cutter (see note)\nNotes\nI think a pastry cutter makes easy work of combining the butter and flour, but if you don't have one, you can use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour.\nScones\nBaking\nPeach"
