To unmold, follow your popsicle mold's instructions.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n, whisk,\n3-ounce popsicle molds\nNotes\nThis recipe is formulated to make six 3-ounce popsicles, but you can scale it up or down as needed to accommodate popsicle molds of different sizes and numbers. You can read about\nour favorite popsicle molds right here\n.\nIf using frozen fruit, place the frozen strawberries in a medium bowl and let thaw at room temperature until slightly softened, about 1 hour. Discard any liquid that has accumulated at the bottom of the bowl before proceeding with recipe (this will increase the total time of the recipe).\nIf you have freeze-dried whole or sliced strawberries, grind them in a blender until powdery and fine, with no visible chunks of fruit, then measure out the amount needed.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nAfter unmolding, each popsicle can be tightly wrapped in plastic and kept frozen for up to 4 weeks.\nRecipes By Diet\nDairy-free Desserts\nGluten-free Desserts\nStrawberry\n4th of July"
