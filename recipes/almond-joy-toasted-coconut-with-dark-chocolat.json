Spread coconut thinly and evenly across a half sheet pan and toast until coconut edges just begin to brown and turn aromatic, 2 to 4 minutes. Do not overbake coconut or ice cream will taste burnt.\nTransfer coconut to a medium saucepan and cover with cream and milk. Bring to a boil, stir to combine, and remove from heat. Cover, transfer to refrigerator, and let steep overnight or about 8 hours.\nThe next day, strain dairy through a fine mesh strainer into a large measuring cup or a bowl with a pouring spout. Press very firmly on coconut shreds to strain as much liquid out as possible.\nIn a heavy medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until lighter in color and slightly thickened. Pour dairy into saucepan with eggs and whisk until fully combined. Cook on medium heat, stirring frequently, until a custard forms on the back of a spoon and a swiped finger leaves a clean line.\nStrain custard into an ice bath or airtight container and chill until ice cream base falls below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Churn according to manufacturer's instructions. In last minute of churning, add chocolate and almonds. Transfer ice cream to airtight container and chill for at least 4 hours in freezer before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nRead More\nHow To Churn Your Leftover Halloween Candy Into Ice Cream\nHomemade Butterfingers\nGooey Caramel Twix Bars\nIce Cream\nChocolate\nCoconut\nHeavy Cream\nAlmonds"
