Stir 2 tablespoons water into 1 cup leftover cranberry sauce to loosen consistency: the sauce should gently plop when dropped from a spoon. Add more water as needed. Pulse almonds, sugar, butter, light brown sugar, flour, and orange zest in food processor; transfer to bowl. Wipe out food processor.\nFor the Cake:\nSpray Bundt pan with baking spray.\nRub orange zest into sugar with fingertips or palms until sugar is orange and no zest strands remain. In large bowl, beat butter and orange sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.\nAdd eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. In separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Decrease mixer speed to low and add flour mixture in three batches, alternating with sour cream. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Add vanilla and beat mixture on medium speed just until combined, about 20 seconds.\nSprinkle half of topping in prepared pan. Scrape half of batter over topping. Drop 2-tablespoon-sized dollops of cranberry sauce over batter and delicately smooth over batter. Scrape remaining batter over cake and spread out into an even layer. Sprinkle with remaining topping, pressing it gently down into the cake.\nBake until cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool cake in pan set on rack for 15 minutes, then, turn out directly onto rack and cool completely, about 1 hour. Dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar. Serve.\nSpecial equipment\nfood processor, electric mixer, rubber spatula, Bundt pan, cooling rack\nCakes\nBaking\nCranberry\nThanksgiving Desserts",
