Cover and set aside overnight. In a separate large bowl, add salt beef and pig tail and cover with cold water. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours. Drain beans, discarding any debris or shriveled beans. Drain and rinse the salt beef and pig tail.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nIn a large Dutch oven, combine drained beans, drained salt beef and pig tail, beef chuck, and garlic. Cover with cold water (8 to 10 cups) and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered (adjusting heat as needed to maintain simmer), until peas are tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nAdd coconut milk, allspice, thyme sprigs, scallions, and whole Scotch bonnet and\u00a0 continue to simmer for 30 minutes before adding spinners.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nFor the Spinners and to Serve:\nMeanwhile, in small bowl, whisk together flour and a large pinch of salt. Add 1/2 cup (118ml) cold water and knead until a sticky dough ball forms. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nTear off small pieces of dough and roll them into cigarette-sized strips. Stir into stew, season with salt to taste, and let simmer until the stew thickens and spinners are cooked through, 15 to 30 minutes. Remove allspice berries, thyme sprigs, scallions, and Scotch Bonnet pepper.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nServe over white rice with sliced avocado, fried ripe plantain, and pickled cucumber on the side.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven\nNotes\nSalted beef, also called salt beef and cured beef, is a corned beef\u2013like product sold in Jamaican and Caribbean markets, as are salted pig tail.\nWe highly recommend including the salted meats\u2014in particular, the pig tail \u2013 for an added punch of intense flavor. But this dish can be made into a delightful vegetarian dish by just eliminating the cured salt beef, boneless beef chuck, and pig tail.\nWe recommend using a meat cleaver for easier cutting of the pig tail.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nSalt beef and beans may be soaked ahead of time and held in the refrigerator.\nComfort Food\nThe Latest\nBraised & Stewed Beans\nBeans\nJamaican",
