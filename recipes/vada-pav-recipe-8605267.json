Set aside.\nSerious Eats /Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nFor the Vadas:\nPlace potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until tender and a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 15 minutes. Using a colander, drain potatoes and let rest for 10 minutes to dry and cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nTransfer cooked potatoes to a large mixing bowl and using a potato masher, mash until no big chunks remain. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nIn a large skillet, saut\u00e9 pan, or wok, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and asafoetida, and cook until they start to pop. Add curry leaves, then reduce the heat to low and stir in salt, chile powder, and turmeric. (Please note, the curry leaves sputter and pop when added to the hot oil, so be prepared with a lid or splatter guard to contain it.) Add potatoes, stirring to incorporate, then remove from heat. Set aside to cool, about 15 minutes. Divide spiced potato mixture into 10 even portions, each about 1.5 inches in diameter, and shape each into a tightly packed ball.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nIn a medium bowl, whisk chickpea flour, salt, turmeric, and chile powder together. Whisk in water until completely smooth.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nIn a 6-quart Dutch oven or wok, heat oil over medium heat until it reaches 350\u00baF (177\u00baC). Meanwhile, set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet or line the baking sheet with paper towels.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nUsing a tablespoon, carefully drizzle 4 to 6 tablespoonfuls of batter into the oil. Fry, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer fried batter to prepared baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nReturn oil to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC). Working in batches to prevent overcrowding the oil, dip vadas in the batter, allowing excess to drain off, then carefully lower into the oil. Fry until crisp and golden brown all over, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer fried potato balls to prepared baking sheet and season with salt. Return oil to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC) and repeat with remaining potato balls. When all the patties have been fried, add green chiles and fry until blistered, about 1 1/2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nFor the Garlic Chutney:\nUsing a mortar and pestle, pound garlic cloves with salt to paste. Add fried batter and chile powder and continue to crush with pestle, smashing and grinding until you get a fine breadcrumb texture.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nTo Assemble:\nUsing an offset spatula, spread 1 tablespoon cilantro chutney onto bottom of each roll. Top with vadas and 1 teaspoon garlic chutney, along with 1 fried chile. Sandwich and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor, large skillet, saut\u00e9 pan, or wok, 6-quart Dutch oven, wire rack, rimmed baking sheet, mortar and pestle, offset spatula\nRead More\nAkara (Nigerian Black-Eyed Pea Fritters)\nPapri Chaat (Indian Street Snack) Recipe\nRusset Potatoes\nThe Latest\nIndian\nSandwiches",
