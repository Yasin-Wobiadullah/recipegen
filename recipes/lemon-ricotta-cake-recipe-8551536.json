Mix on medium speed until incorporated, about 1 minute, then increase speed to medium-high and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape the bowl and paddle with a rubber spatula halfway through.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nReduce speed to medium-low and add eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next. Add ricotta and increase speed to medium, beating until incorporated, about 1 minute. (The mixture may look broken, this is okay.) Stop the mixer and add the flour all at once.
