Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add stock, bring to a simmer, and cook until vegetables are very tender, about 8 minutes. Add lettuce and parsley and cook until wilted and softened, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWorking in batches if necessary, transfer broth and vegetables to a blender and blend, starting at the lowest speed and increasing to high, until very smooth, about 3 minutes. If soup is too thick, thin as needed with additional stock. Season with salt and just a touch of lemon juice to brighten flavor (add it very sparingly to prevent soup from becoming tart). Garnish with radish and pea shoots (or other garnish) and serve warm or chilled.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nThis recipe works with many varieties of lettuce, including romaine, Bibb, oak leaf, arugula, and cress. I'd advise against iceberg because of its extreme lack of flavor.\nYou can use shallots or leeks in place of or in combination with the onion.\nFeel free to change the garnish depending on what's available; diced crispy bacon and cherry tomatoes would be fun.\nRead More\nHow to Make Creamy Vegetable Soups Without a Recipe\n16 Chilled Soups to Make the Most of Summer Produce\nHow to Clean and Store Fresh Produce\nSoups\nGreens\nSummer Mains\nSummer Snacks & Appetizers"
