Grease a 2-quart baking dish with butter. Combine cheeses in a large bowl. Transfer 1/3 of cheese mixture to a separate bowl and set aside. Add cream, thyme, and garlic to first bowl of cheese mixture. Season generously with salt and pepper. Add potato slices and toss with hands until every slice is coated with cream mixture, making sure to separate any slices that are sticking together so the cream mixture gets between them.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nPick up a handful of potatoes, organizing them into a neat stack, and lay them in prepared baking dish with their edges aligned vertically. Continue placing potatoes in dish, working around the perimeter and into the center until all potatoes have been added. Potatoes should be very tightly packed. If necessary, slice additional potatoes, coat slices with cream mixture, and add to dish (see notes). Pour excess cream/cheese mixture evenly over potatoes until mixture comes halfway up sides of dish. You may not need all excess liquid (see notes).\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nCover tightly with foil and transfer to oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until top is pale golden brown, about 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove from oven, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and return to oven. Bake until deep golden brown and crisp on top, about 30 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let rest for a few minutes, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nSpecial Equipment\n2-quart oval or rectangular\nbaking dish\n,\nmandoline\nNotes\nBecause of variation in the shape of the potatoes, the amount of potato that will fit into a single baking dish varies. Longer, thinner potatoes will fill a dish more thoroughly than shorter, rounder potatoes. When purchasing potatoes, buy a few extra in order to fill the dish, if necessary. Depending on the exact shape and size of the potatoes and baking dish, you may not need all of the cream mixture.\nHow to Scale Down This Recipe to Feed a Smaller Crowd\nThis recipe can be scaled by half. Divide all ingredients by two; substitute a 10-inch skillet for the baking dish listed.\nRead More\nHoney-Glazed Hasselback Butternut Squash With Parmesan Breadcrumbs\nClassic Rich and Silky Potato Gratin (Scalloped Potatoes)\nHow to Store Potatoes So They Last Longer\nAir-Fryer Roast Potatoes\nVegetable Sides\nThanksgiving Side Dishes\nGruyere\nRusset Potatoes\nChristmas Sides"
