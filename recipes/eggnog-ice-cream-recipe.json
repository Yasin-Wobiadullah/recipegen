Slowly whisk in cream, then milk. Cook, whisking frequently, over medium heat, until a custard forms on the back of a spoon and a finger swiped across the back leaves a clean line.\nRemove from heat and stir in nutmeg, salt, and bourbon. Pour through a strainer into an airtight container and chill overnight.\nThe next day, churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Return to airtight container and chill in freezer for at least 3 hours before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nNotes\nThe amount of bourbon listed here will impart a noticeable but balanced boozy flavor to the ice cream, though the intensity of the flavor will increase the next day. You can reduce the alcohol to none if you prefer, or increase it by a tablespoon, without doing any textural damage to the ice cream. Brandy, Scotch, and rum are also worthy substitutions for bourbon, depending on your tastes.\nRead More\nThe Real Rules of Making Boozy Ice Cream\nIce Cream\nChristmas Desserts"
