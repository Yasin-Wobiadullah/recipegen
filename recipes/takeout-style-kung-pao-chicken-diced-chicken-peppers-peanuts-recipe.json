Set aside.\nMelissa Hom\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add chicken, spread into a single layer, and cook without moving until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Continue cooking, tossing and stirring frequently, until the exterior is opaque but chicken is still slightly raw in the center, about 2 minute longer. Transfer to a clean bowl and set aside.\nMelissa Hom\nWipe out wok and heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil over high heat until smoking. Add bell peppers and celery and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until brightly colored and browned in spots, about 1 minute. Add peanuts and toss to combine.\nMelissa Hom\nPush vegetables up side of wok to clear a space in the center. Add garlic, ginger, scallions, and dried chiles and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return chicken to wok and toss to combine. Stir sauce and add to wok. Cook, tossing, until sauce thickens and coats ingredients and chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute longer. Serve immediately.\nMelissa Hom\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nNotes\nIf you can't find boneless skinless chicken thighs, you can\ndebone them yourself using this guide\n. Shaoxing wine can be found in most Asian markets. If unavailable, dry sherry can be used in its place. If you can't find whole dried chiles, substitute with 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes.\nChinese\nChinese-American\nChicken Stir-Fry\nChicken Thighs\nChicken Mains",
