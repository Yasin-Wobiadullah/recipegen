Place in refrigerator and brine for at least 2 hours, up to 8 hours.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nRemove duck from brine; pat dry with paper towels. Using the point of a skewer or paring knife, prick holes all over duck breasts, being careful not to pierce the meat.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nPlace duck on a wire rack in the sink. Pour 1 quart of boiling water over duck. Flip and pour remaining quart of water over other side. Allow duck to dry while preparing the grill.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nTo make the tea packet, place tea leaves, brown sugar, rice, star anise, cinnamon sticks, and orange zest in a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil and fold into a packet. Cut slits at top of foil packet.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on either side of the charcoal grate and place a foil pan between the two piles of coals. Cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Place tea packet directly on top of the coals. Run spit of the rotisserie through middle of duck and secure ends with rotisserie forks. Place on the grill, cover, and cook at medium-high heat until duck registers 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) when an instant-read thermometer is inserted into the thickest part of the breast. Remove from grill, let rest for 15 minutes, then remove spit and serve.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n, rotisserie\nThis Recipe Appears In\nGrilling: Tea Smoked Rotisserie Duck\nDuck\nSmoking",
