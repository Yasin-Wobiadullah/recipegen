The mushrooms will exude quite a bit of liquid; let the liquid cook off for a few minutes as you brown the mushrooms.\nPour the liquid into the bowls or cups and cover with saran wrap or fitted lids.\nPlace the covered cups in the preheated steamer over high heat. When the surface turns white, about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat to medium-low and steam for a further 15 minutes.\nTest the custard by inserting a bamboo skewer or toothpick into the center. The custard is done when the liquid runs clear. The surface of the custard should be slick and moist.\nServe hot or chilled in the cup.\nSpecial Equipment\nCheesecloth\nEggs\nJapanese"
