Rub evenly over every surface of brisket. Combine peppercorns, mustard, coriander, allspice, cloves, ginger, and bay leaves and sprinkle evenly over both sides of beef, pressing spices gently into the meat until they stick. Seal the beef in a vacuum sealed bag or a zipper-lock bag with all of the air pressed out of it. Place in the coldest part of the refrigerator and let rest for 7 days, flipping once a day.\nTo Cook in a Sous-Vide Cooker:\nThe day before serving, remove beef from the bag and rinse off all spices under cold, running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Re-seal in a vacuum bag and cook at 180\u00b0F until tender, about 10 hours. Proceed to step 4.\nTo Cook in a Dutch Oven:\nThe day before serving, remove beef from the bag and rinse off all spices under cold, running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Preheat oven to 200\u00b0F. Place brisket in large Dutch oven, cover with water by several inches, and bring to a simmer over high heat. Remove from heat, cover with lid slightly ajar, place in oven, and cook until completely tender, about 10 hours. Proceed to step 4.\nOnce beef is cooked, transfer to an airtight container along with cooking liquid. Let rest in refrigerator at least overnight, and up to 3 days.\nThe day of: Transfer cooking liquid to a large saucepan or Dutch oven along with carrots, potatoes, and cabbage. Top up with water until vegetables are submerged. Slice beef thinly against the grain and fan slices out in large skillet. Add 1 cup of liquid from pot to skillet and place skillet on top of pot. Cover skillet. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until vegetables are completely tender and beef is heated through, about 45 minutes. Serve immediately with hot mustard.\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion circulator\nor\nDutch oven\n,\nscale\n, pink salt\nNotes\nYou can also make this recipe using store-bought corned beef.
