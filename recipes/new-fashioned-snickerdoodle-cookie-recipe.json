Combine butter, coconut oil, sugar, salt, baking powder, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix at low speed to combine, then increase to medium and beat until soft, fluffy, and pale, about 5 minutes, although the exact timing will vary. Halfway through, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, and then resume mixing on medium speed. Add egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix to form a stiff dough.\nUsing a cookie scoop, divide dough into 2-tablespoon portions. If you like, these can be transferred to a zipper-lock bag and refrigerated for up to 1 week, or frozen for up to 3 months; soften to about 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) before baking.\nFor the Cinnamon Sugar:\nMix sugar with ground and grated cinnamon in a small bowl, adding more spice if you prefer. (It should taste very intense to offset the mild dough.) Roll each portion of dough into a smooth and sticky ball, then tumble in cinnamon sugar until fully coated.\nArrange on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, leaving 2 1/2 inches between balls, then flatten into 2-inch disks about 1/2 inch thick. Generously cover with the remaining cinnamon sugar, creating a thick layer that will crack and crinkle in the oven.\nBake until the snickerdoodles begin to spread, about 5 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Continue baking until firm around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 6 minutes longer. Cool directly on baking sheet until the crumb is set, about 8 minutes. Enjoy warm, or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nflexible spatula\n, 2-tablespoon\ncookie scoop\n,\nMicroplane\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nThis recipe works best with cassia cinnamon sticks, which are easy to grate and boost the classic flavor of cinnamon in snickerdoodles. Grate on a spice grater or zester, such as a Microplane, working from the tip of the cinnamon stick, rather than its side.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTo make ahead, divide portioned dough between heavy-duty zipper-lock bags and refrigerate up to one week (or freeze for up to three months). Soften the dough at room temperature until roughly 70\u00b0F, then roll, coat, flatten, and bake as directed.\nCookies\nChristmas Cookies"
