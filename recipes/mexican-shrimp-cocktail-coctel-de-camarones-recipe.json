Transfer to refrigerator for 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nMeanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir together 4 tablespoons lime juice with onion, tomato pur\u00e9e, ketchup, cilantro, orange juice, and jalape\u00f1o.\nIn a medium pot, combine 2 quarts cold water with remaining 2 tablespoons lime juice and 2 tablespoons salt. Add shrimp, set over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until temperature reaches 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer and shrimp are just cooked through; adjust heat to make sure temperature does not go over 170\u00b0F.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nDrain shrimp carefully, rinse under cold running water, then drain well. Cut shrimp into 1/2-inch pieces. Add shrimp to bowl with sauce and toss to combine. Taste, then add more lime juice if desired. Top with avocado and serve immediately with saltines and hot sauce.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nYou can skip the deveining if the shrimp don't have dark veins. I've also found that you can often remove the veins with tweezers from the head end of the shrimp without having to slice them down the back, which is the most common method for deveining (though that method works well, too).\nExactly how much lime juice you need will depend in part on the specific brands of tomato pur\u00e9e\u00a0and ketchup you use; adjust accordingly to get the flavor balance that tastes right to you.\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nCoctel de Camarones (Colombian-Style Shrimp Ceviche Cocktail)\nShrimp\nMexican\nStovetop Seafood\nSides\nCinco de Mayo",
