Add water and olive oil and mix until fully incorporated. Continue mixing and kneading until a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 5 minutes. Grease a medium bowl with olive oil. Stretch dough ball by tucking it under itself to form a taut, smooth ball. Drizzle with olive oil, rub to coat, and transfer to greased bowl. Cover with plastic and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\nMeanwhile, For the Filling:\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add green peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until just starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions and green peppers are very soft and sweet, about 25 minutes; lower heat as necessary to prevent burning. Stir in tuna, season with salt, and set aside.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Grease a large rectangular or circular rimmed baking dish or large cast iron skillet with olive oil. Divide dough into 2 portions, one twice as large as the other. On a floured work surface, roll out larger dough to form a thin sheet. Transfer rolled-out dough to the greased baking dish, pressing it into corners and allowing dough to overhang rim, trimming off any excess.\nScrape filling into baking dish, smoothing it in an even, flat layer.\nRoll out smaller portion of dough to form a thin sheet. Transfer to baking dish, arranging it to cover filling in an even layer. Roll overhanging dough of bottom crust onto top crust, twisting to seal.\nCut a small hole in center of top crust to form steam vent. Using a piece of dough trimmings, form a small decorative ring for steam vent. Transfer to oven and bake until browned on top and cooked through, 45-55 minutes (setting baking dish or skillet on a preheated baking stone or bottom of oven for about half of the cooking time will help crisp and brown the bottom crust).\nRemove from oven and let cool slightly. Cut into wedges (if pie is circular) or squares (if pie is rectangular) and serve warm or at room temperature.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge circular or rectangular rimmed baking dish (about 3-quart capacity) or large cast iron skillet\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Galician Empanadas (The Original Empanadas)\nCanned Fish\nSpanish\nDairy-free Mains\nSavory\nSeafood Mains",
