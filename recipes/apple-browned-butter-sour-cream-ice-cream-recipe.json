  "full_text": "Apple, Browned Butter, & Sour Cream Ice Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n30 mins\nChurning/Freezing Time\n8 hrs 40 mins\nTotal\n9 hrs 20 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nstick\n(\n8\ntablespoons\n)\nbutter\n, cut into small chunks\n[or\n2\nsticks\nfor second version]\n4\ncups\napple cider\n, plus\n1\ntablespoon\n, divided (see note)\n1/2\nteaspoon\nfreshly grated\nnutmeg\n2\ncups\nsour cream\n3/4\ncup\nwhole milk\n[or\n1/2\ncup\nfor second version]\n1/4\ncup\nbrown sugar\n[or\n1/2\ncup\nfor second version]\n1\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\nPinch\nof\nsalt\nDirections\nIn a skillet, melt butter on medium heat. When fully melted, increase heat and let butter brown to a rich amber. When the color has darkened significantly and you see black particles in the pan, pour off into a heat-proof container, straining out the black particles on the bottom, and set aside to cool.\nIn a medium saucepan, bring the four cups of apple cider to a boil and add the nutmeg. Reduce until you have 1/2 cup of syrup, about 20 minutes. Do not reduce further. Keep an eye on it when bubbles start stacking up, as it will reduce very quickly. Set aside to cool.\nWhisk together sour cream, milk, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl. When the butter and apple cider syrup have cooled, whisk them in very thoroughly. The butterfat must be completely emulsified into the base, or it will get grainy when frozen. You can do this step in your blender if you like. Add the last tablespoon of apple cider, cover, and refrigerate overnight. The base will also keep for up to a week.\nThe next day, spin the base in your ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. The ice cream is at its peak at this point as soft-serve, or after an hour in the freezer, which will firm it up a bit. If you plan to serve it later, leave it to thaw on the counter for at least half an hour before serving, or it will be grainy.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nNotes\nUse the best apple cider you can get, but take a look at the nutrition facts. This recipe is formulated for cider with 120 calories (two tablespoons of sugar) per cup. If your four cups of apple cider have less than 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons, 480 calories) of sugar, add enough brown sugar to compensate.\nIce Cream\nApple\nFall Desserts",
