  "full_text": "Babcia Bread (Polish Grandmother Sweet Bread)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n35 mins\nCook\n60 mins\nProof/Cool\n4 hrs 40 mins\nTotal\n6 hrs 15 mins\nServes\n10\nto 12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nstick\nbutter\n1/2\ncup\nmilk\n2 1/2\nteaspoons\n(\n1\npackage\n)\nyeast\n3 3/4\ncups\nall-purpose flour\n, divided\n3\neggs\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n2/3\ncup\nsugar\n1\ntablespoon\nvanilla\nDirections\nPut the milk and butter into microwave-safe container and heat to melt the butter. The milk shouldn't boil, it should be just warm enough to melt the butter. Cool (if needed) to lukewarm.\nPut the milk mixture into the bowl of your stand mixer, add the yeast and 1 cup of flour, and mix well.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit for 15 minutes. It will rise a bit during this time.\nAdd eggs, and beat with the paddle attachment until well combined. Add salt, sugar and vanilla and beat well. Add the remaining 2 3/4 cups of flour, mix with the paddle to combine, then switch to the dough hook and knead well.\nDuring kneading, the dough will begin sticking to the sides of the bowl and building up, until very little is left on the hook. Stop the mixer and scrape it down as this happens. It may take several times before the dough gives up on this sticking. Eventually, the dough will form a ball around the hook, with just a little \"foot\" of dough stuck to the bottom of the bowl, but the sides will remain clean. Keep kneading until the dough is smooth and shiny. It will be a soft dough, but it shouldn't be sticky or goopy at all. If it is sticky, add additional flour as needed, in small increments. It shouldn't need a lot more flour; this dough seems loose while kneading but holds its shape well after you form it.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest until doubled in size; it may take 2 hours, or more.\nSprinkle cornmeal on the bottom of a 10-inch loaf pan.\nKnead dough again, shape, and put into a bread pan. You shouldn't need any flour to knead or shape this dough. It's not sticky at all.\nLet it rise again until doubled in size. Again, It can take a long time to rise. Be patient.\nBrush top with beaten egg yolk mixed with water, if desired, for a shiny top. You can slash the top, or leave it as-is.\nBake at 325\u00b0F until deeply browned, 45 to 55 minutes.\nLet the loaf cool for five minutes before taking it out of the pan to cool completely on a rack before cutting.\nYeast Breads"
