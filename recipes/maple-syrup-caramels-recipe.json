Line pan again with parchment paper, leaving overhang on alternate sides from foil. Lightly oil parchment or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.\nCombine heavy cream, butter, sea salt, and maple extract (if using) in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Immediately remove saucepan from heat and set aside.\nCombine sugar, maple syrup, corn syrup, and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil without stirring, swirling pan occasionally until mixture has gone from light to dark amber, about 6 minutes.\nCarefully pour cream mixture into sugar mixture. It will bubble vigorously. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until a candy thermometer registers 248\u00b0F (120\u00b0C). Pour caramel into prepared pan. Allow caramel to cool for at least 3 hours. Cut caramel into 1-inch pieces using kitchen shears and wrap pieces in wax paper. Caramels will keep for at least a week stored in an airtight container at room temperature, and even longer in refrigerator.\nSpecial Equipment\nCandy thermometer or\nleave-in probe thermometer\nRead More\nSmoked Salt Caramels\nBoozy Caramel Bonbons\nSalted Cashew Caramel Bars\nCandy\nStovetop"
