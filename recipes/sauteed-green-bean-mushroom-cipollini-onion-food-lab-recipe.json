Add cipollini onions, season well with salt and pepper, reduce heat to low, and cook, turning occasionally, until onions are a deep, caramel brown, about 45 minutes total.\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add beans and cook until tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Drain and run under cool running water until cold. Set aside.\nHeat oil in a large saucepan over high heat until lightly smoking. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they've released all their liquid and are browned, about 10 minutes total, reducing heat if oil starts to smoke excessively. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add shallots, garlic, thyme, and remaining tablespoon butter (or olive oil) and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add soy sauce and toss to combine.\nAdd green beans, onions, and lemon juice to mushrooms and toss to reheat and combine. Serve immediately.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can caramelize the onions and cook the mushrooms up to 5 days ahead of time and blanch the green beans the day before (let them sit much longer than that and they'll lose color). To serve, combine beans, mushrooms, and onions in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until hot.\nGreen Beans\nCremini & Button Mushrooms\nOnions\nVegetable Sides\nThanksgiving Side Dishes"
