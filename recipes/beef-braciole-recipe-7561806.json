Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nIf using a top round roast, slice roast into six 1/2 -inch slices. If using pre-sliced beef, skip to Step 5.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nLay steak slices 3 inches apart on a cutting board and cover with plastic wrap. Using meat pounder, flatten slices into rough rectangles measuring no more than 1/4 inch thick.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSprinkle both sides of steaks with salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Spread the reserved breadcrumb mixture evenly over steaks, then place 1 slice of prosciutto over each breadcrumb-topped steak, folding prosciutto to fit and pressing firmly into steak. Being careful to keep filling in place and starting from a short end of each steak, roll each steak to form a small bundle. Tie each bundle with 2 pieces of kitchen twine to secure.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nFor the Sauce:\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add braciole bundles and brown on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer browned braciole to a clean plate; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nAdd onion and salt to the now-empty pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until just fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, and cook until mixture reduces by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and water. Nestle the browned braciole bundles into the sauce and bring the sauce to a simmer.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nCover the pan with an oven-safe lid or aluminum foil. Place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Cook, covered, flipping braciole halfway through, for 90 minutes. Carefully remove the lid, flip the braciole again, and continue to cook until the meat is fully tender and sauce thickened to gravy-like consistency, 15 to 45 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSeason sauce with salt to taste. Use scissors to cut off twine around each bundle. Transfer braciole to a large serving platter or individual plates and spoon sauce overtop. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch oven-safe saut\u00e9 pan with lid\n, butchers twine,\nmeat pounder\n(if slicing steaks yourself)\nNotes\nI strongly encourage you ask your butcher to slice the beef for you, or use thin pre-sliced top round steaks, sometimes sold as \u201cbraciole steaks,\u201d can be found in some supermarkets, Italian grocers, or butchers. If cutting steaks from a top round roast yourself, look for a longer, oval shaped roast to create longer thin steaks for wrapping.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nCooked braciole with sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.\nRecipes\nThe Latest\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nRecipes By Ingredients\nMains",
