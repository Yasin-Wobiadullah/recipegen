In large wok with lid (or Dutch oven), heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Stir in shallots, ginger, garlic, and chiles. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nAdd crab pieces and broth. Increase heat to medium high and bring to a boil. Cover loosely and gently boil (decrease heat if necessary), until crab has turned red and is nearly cooked through, about 6 minutes.\nRemove cover and stir in tomato paste and chili sauce. Simmer 1 minute and season to taste with salt, sugar, or chili sauce. Stir in cornstarch mixture and bring to a boil to thicken.\nRemove from heat and whisk in egg. Stir in green onions. Ladle into serving dish, sprinkle with cilantro and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge wok with lid\nor\nDutch oven\nNotes\nCrabs need to be rinsed well, cleaned, and cut into pieces. Check out\nthis video by Sydney Fish Market\non how to do it, or get your fishmonger to do it for you. I keep the creamy part inside the top shell for the extra crab flavor it lends to the dish. If using a wok with a lid, make sure it's supported well on the stove.\nI used ABC brand hot chili sauce. I found that I didn't need to adjust my seasoning, but you may want to adjust so it has a balance of sweet, salty, and heat from the chiles.\nTake care when eating the sauce\u2014it may have bits of shell!\nSoutheast Asian\nDairy-free Mains\nCrab\nSeafood Mains"
