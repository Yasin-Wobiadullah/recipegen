Add the chiles, scallions, ginger, garlic, and lemongrass, cooking until they soften and become aromatic, about 5 minutes; don't allow them to brown. Remove from heat and set aside.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, add the ground chicken, fish sauce, salt, mint, and cooked aromatics along with the cooking oil. Mix with your hands until thoroughly combined and the mixture feels sticky and cohesive. In a small saut\u00e9 pan with oil over medium heat, cook a teaspoon of the chicken mixture to taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a medium straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan, add 1/2 inch of oil and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Dip two large spoons in the hot oil, then scoop up a portion of the chicken mixture, using the two spoons to form it into a rough football shape; carefully drop the meatball into the oil. Repeat with all the chicken, dipping the spoons in oil as needed to prevent sticking. Cook the chicken meatballs, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove to a bowl or large plate.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nOnce all the chicken meatballs are cooked, sprinkle the sugar over them, tossing gently to coat. In the same saut\u00e9 pan with the residual cooking oil, increase the heat to high and add the chicken meatballs. Cook on each side until the sugar caramelizes, about 1 minute. Remove to a serving platter.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe right away with Bibb lettuce, assorted pickles, crispy shallots, and any other condiments you desire.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nSaut\u00e9 pan\n,\nmixing bowl\nNotes\nIf you can't find lemongrass, in a pinch the zest of 2 limes can step in as a tangy substitute. There's no need to saut\u00e9 the zest, just add it to the ground chicken along with the cooked aromatics, salt, fish sauce, and mint.\nRead More\nNem L\u1ee5i Hu\u1ebf (Hu\u1ebf Lemongrass Pork Skewers)\nVietnamese Meatball Banh Mi\nCrispy Caramel Chicken Skewers\nVietnamese-Style Baked Chicken\nSlow-Cooker Sticky Thai Meatballs\nMeatballs\nVietnamese\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop Chicken\nChicken"
