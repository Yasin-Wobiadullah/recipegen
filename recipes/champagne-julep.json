Fill the glass with crushed ice.\nAdd the remainder of the cognac, then top with crushed ice and briskly stir the mixture until the glass frosts, adding more crushed ice as needed. Slowly add chilled Champagne or other brut sparkling wine to fill and give a light stir (watch out for foam!).\nGarnish with a mint sprig and spear with a straw.
