Lower heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, covered, until brisket is tender and broth is slightly cloudy, about 2 hours. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard garlic cloves, ginger, and onion from broth.\nTransfer brisket to a work surface and allow to cool slightly, then slice across the grain into bite-size pieces. Transfer brisket to a small bowl and toss well with 1 tablespoon soy sauce and remaining 3 cloves minced garlic. Set aside.\nDrain seaweed and squeeze well to remove excess water. Transfer to work surface and roughly chop into bite-size pieces.\nReturn broth to a simmer and add seaweed and seasoned brisket. If the proportion of liquid to solids is too low for your taste, you can top up with water and return to a simmer. Add remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce and simmer until seaweed is tender, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.\nLadle soup into bowls and serve alongside hot rice and any\nbanchan\n(side dishes) of your choosing.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nJoseon ganjang is made exclusively from soy beans with no wheat; see\nour guide to the Korean pantry\nfor more on Joseon ganjang and yangjo vinegar, including brand recommendations.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; reheat before serving (you may need to thin with water, since the seaweed can thicken the chilled soup).\nKorean\nStovetop\nBrisket\nMains\nComfort Food",
