Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer until farro is just tender, about 20 minutes (see notes). Drain, discard onion, garlic, and carrot and transfer to a bowl to cool.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nGently fold remaining salad ingredients into cooled farro. Add vinaigrette, starting with a few tablespoons at a time. Taste, season with salt and pepper, and add additional vinaigrette as needed. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nNotes\nBe careful not to overcook the farro. You want it to stand up to the vinaigrette, so remove it from the heat just when it loses its bite.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can cook the farro ahead of time and refrigerate it. However, it's best to dress the salad shortly before serving it, ideally at room temperature.\nRead More\n20 Easy, Flavorful Grain Salad Recipes\nWarm Farro Salad With Asparagus, Peas, and Feta Recipe\nSmitten Kitchen's Honey and Harissa Farro Salad\nWhat's the Best Way to Cook Whole Grains?\nGrain Salads\nVegetarian Salads\nBlue Cheese\nFarro & Other Wheat\nQuick Salads",
