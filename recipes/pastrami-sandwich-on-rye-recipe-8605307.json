  "full_text": "Pastrami on Rye\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nServes\n1 serving\nMakes\n1 sandwich\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nslices\nfresh (untoasted) Jewish\nrye bread\nSpicy brown or\nyellow mustard\n8\nounces\n(\n227\ng\n) high-quality (from a good Jewish delicatessen) or\nhomemade\nfatty\npastrami\n, sliced hot across the grain (see notes)\nFull- or half-sour\npickles\n, for serving (optional)\nDirections\nSpread the rye bread with mustard (alternatively, you can keep the mustard out of the sandwich and serve it on the side for dipping). Pile with the pastrami, close the sandwich, halve, and serve, preferably with pickles.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nExactly how much pastrami you put on the sandwich is hotly debated and totally up to you. Some delis will pack upwards of a pound of beef onto one sandwich, which I think borders on the grotesque. The half-pound suggested here is generous without being absurd; you could of course put a little less, but don't go too skimpy or it won't be quite right.\nBeef\nThe Latest\nSandwiches"
