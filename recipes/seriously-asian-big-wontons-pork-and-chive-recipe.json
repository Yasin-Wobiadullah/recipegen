Leftover filling may be frozen and put to use in more wontons, or stir-fried.\nTo boil wontons, bring a pot of water to boil and cook the wontons for 3 to 4 minutes, until the skins are just beginning to turn translucent. Serve in soup or with dipping sauce. To pan-fry wontons, boil the wontons for 2 minutes. Bring a heavy skillet to medium heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Pan-fry on one or two sides. Refrain from moving the wontons around in the pan, so as to give the surface of the wontons a chance to brown.\nNoodles\nChinese\nPork\nPork Mains",
