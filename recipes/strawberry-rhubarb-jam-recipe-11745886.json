Wash jars with soap and hot water. Place jars, open mouth facing downwards, on a prepared baking sheet and heat at 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place rings and lids in a pan of water on the stovetop and boil for 10 minutes. (See notes.) Remove jars from oven and let cool, about 15 minutes. Using tongs, remove rings and lids from pan of water and set them on wire rack with jars to cool.\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, combine strawberries and sugar, tossing to evenly coat. Let sit until the fruit begins to release their juices, 15 to 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a large non-reactive and heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, combine macerated strawberries and their juices with the rhubarb, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until strawberries and rhubarb are completely broken down and mixture registers at least 220\u00b0F (104\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and, using a spoon, skim off any foam. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nLadle jam into prepared jars, leaving 1/4-inch head space, and cover tightly with lids.
