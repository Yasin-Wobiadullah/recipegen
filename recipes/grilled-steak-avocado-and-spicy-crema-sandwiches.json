Brush one side of each bread slice with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and cook over medium heat, 2 slices at a time, oiled side down, until golden and toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer to cooling rack.\nFor the Avocado Spread and Crema:\nRemove and discard avocado pits, then scoop flesh out into large bowl. Coarsely mash with fork.
