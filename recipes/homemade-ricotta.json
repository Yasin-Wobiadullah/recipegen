Stir in salt, if using. Heat over medium heat until milk registers 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Add vinegar or lemon juice and stir briefly to incorporate. Curds should begin forming almost immediately; stop stirring as soon as they've formed throughout the pot.\nSerious Eats\nWithout stirring, continue to hold curdled-milk mixture at 185\u00b0F for 20 minutes. It's okay if the temperature fluctuates down to 175\u00b0F (79\u00b0C) or up to 190\u00b0F (88\u00b0C), but try to keep it in that zone for the full 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats\nLine a fine-mesh strainer with paper towels or cheesecloth. Using a slotted spoon, transfer curds to strainer and let stand until excess liquid has drained away. Exactly how long to let it drain depends on whether you want a moister final product or a drier one. Do not try to pour all the milky liquid through the strainer, as this will clog it and prevent the liquid from flowing through.\nSerious Eats\nDrained ricotta can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days, though it is best when freshly made.\nSerious Eats\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nslotted spoon\nNotes\nThis recipe can be scaled up or down as desired. You can use pasteurized milk, homogenized milk, and/or cream-line milk, but do not use ultra-pasteurized milk, as it will not work.\nDistilled white vinegar creates the most neutral flavor, while lemon juice adds just a touch of lemony flavor; that can be good in some applications (like, say, if you're dolloping the ricotta onto pancakes), but may not be desirable in others.\nI prefer not to add salt, since the ricotta can always be seasoned later, but feel free to add a pinch if you like.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nRicotta is best when freshly made, but once drained, it can be stored in the refrigerator, covered, for up to two days.\nRead More\nAvocado Toast With Ricotta, Olive Oil, Lemon Zest, and Basil\nSweet-Sour Macerated Cherries With Marcona Almonds, Mint, and Ricotta\nAsparagus Tartine With Ricotta and Mint\nLemon Ricotta Pancakes\nQuick and Easy Homemade Ricotta Gnocchi\nRicotta\nItalian"
