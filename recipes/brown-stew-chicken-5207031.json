Cut each bone-in breast in thirds crosswise to yield 3 pieces, to make 12 pieces of chicken in total. Remove chicken skin only if desired.\nJillian Atkinson\nIn a large bowl, stir together lime juice, 1 tablespoon (15ml) browning sauce, dark soy sauce, 2 teaspoons salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 8 hours.\nJillian Atkinson\nIn a large Dutch oven or saut\u00e9 pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, add chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter, and reserve marinade.\nJillian Atkinson\nReduce heat to medium. Add onion, bell pepper, and tomatoes to the pot and cook, stirring often and scraping the bottom to release any browned bits, until vegetables are softened, about 8 minutes.\nJillian Atkinson\nAdd scallions, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring, until garlic and scallions are softened but not browned, about 1 minute. Stir in cornstarch and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.\nJillian Atkinson\nAdd 2 cups (475ml) water along with the reserved marinade, sugar, Scotch bonnet, allspice, and the remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) browning. Nestle the chicken drumsticks, thighs, and wings into the braising liquid, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 40 minutes.\nJillian Atkinson\nNestle the reserved chicken breasts into the stew, cover, and simmer until chicken breasts register 155\u00b0F (70\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes.\nJillian Atkinson\nStir in ketchup and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, then simmer over medium-low heat, uncovered, until sauce has thickened to a rich and glossy sauce that thinly coats the back of the spoon but not thick as a roux based sauce, about 5 minutes. Serve with white rice,\nrice and peas\n, and/or cooked cabbage.\nJillian Atkinson\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven or saut\u00e9 pan, instant-read thermometer\nNotes\nYou can adjust the spicy intensity of the Scotch bonnet by either leaving it whole (mild heat), cut and deseeded (medium heat), cut open with seeds (hot).\nJamaican\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Mains\nWhole Chicken\nThe Latest"
