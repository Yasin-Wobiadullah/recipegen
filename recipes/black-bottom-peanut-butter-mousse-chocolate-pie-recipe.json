Combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter in a bowl and stir to combine. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Bake for 15 minutes, until the crust gets slightly browned. Allow the crust to cool completely.\nMake the chocolate layer:\nPlace chopped chocolate, pinch of salt, and corn syrup in a bowl. Bring the milk to a boil, immediately remove from the heat, and pour over the chocolate. Allow this to sit for 1 minute, then whisk until all of the chocolate has melted and the mixture is homogenous. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and whisk constantly over low heat for about 8 minutes. The mixture will steam, thicken, and begin to sputter and bubble. Continue to whisk and scrape the bottom to prevent burning. When the mixture is of pudding consistency, remove from the heat. Pour into a bowl, press plastic wrap directly on the surface, and chill for 3 hours.\nMake the mousse layer:\nJust before assembly, whisk peanut butter and confectioner's sugar together until the mixture is thick and glossy. Whisk about 1/3 of the chilled whipped cream into the mixture to lighten it, then fold in the remaining 2/3, taking care not to deflate it.\nAssemble the pie:\nSpread the chilled chocolate layer evenly over the bottom of the pie shell, then pour the mousse evenly over that. If desired, top with additional whipped cream, chocolate syrup, nuts, or chocolate chips. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\n9 inch pie plate\nThis Recipe Appears In\nPie of the Week: Black-Bottom Peanut Butter Mousse Pie\nPies\nBaking\nChocolate\nPeanut Butter",
