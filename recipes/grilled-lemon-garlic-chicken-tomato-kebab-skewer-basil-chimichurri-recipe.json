Add to marinade and mix to coat. It needs to sit for only about 5 minutes.\nFor the Chimichurri:\nWhile chicken marinates, combine basil, parsley, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, a large pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until herbs are coarsely chopped. Season to taste with more salt and pepper as desired. Pour into a serving bowl and leave at room temperature until chicken is ready.\nThread chicken onto metal (or pre-soaked bamboo) skewers,\nusing a halved onion or potato\nto make the process faster and safer.
