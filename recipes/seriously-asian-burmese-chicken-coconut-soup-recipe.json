Puree until smooth.\nSpread the cut-up chicken out on a plate. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and let sit.\nPlace the flour in a bowl. Slowly add 1 cup of the chicken broth to mix well.\nHeat a skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. When the oil is hot, toss in the chicken and stir-fry until lightly browned. Some of the fat will render from the chicken skin. Remove the chicken with a slotted spoon.\nAdd the sliced onions to the pan and cook slowly, allowing the onions to caramelize over the course of five to seven minutes. Towards the end of that time when the onions are beginning to brown, add the turmeric and paprika.\nIn a pot suited for soups, add the chicken along with the juices that will have settled, the saut\u00e9ed onions, the onion and ginger puree, and the remaining 2 cups of chicken broth. Carefully add the chickpea flour and broth mixture, mixing quickly so that the flour won't clump.\nBring the pot to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Season to taste with more salt, if needed.\nAdd the coconut milk. Stir to mix and return to a simmer. Serve with noodles and garnishes as desired.\nSoups\nSouth Asian\nStovetop\nCoconut Milk & Cream\nChicken Mains"
