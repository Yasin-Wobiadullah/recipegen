Add fish and let soak for 10 minutes. Drain fish and pat dry inside and out with paper towels.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and position rack in center of oven. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Season fish inside and out with salt and pepper and rub with olive oil. Stuff belly cavities with rosemary, fennel fronds, and tangerine slices.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nRoast fish until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 135\u00b0F (58\u00b0C), 20 to 25 minutes; alternatively, roast until fins come right off when pulled and flesh can be felt to flake under the skin when you press on it. Remove from oven and let rest 5 minutes.\nGently carve fillets from bone cage\n, transfer to plates, and drizzle with vinaigrette. Serve.\nNotes\nIf you can't find branzino, you can substitute any other white-fleshed fish of a similar weight (or a single fish that's double the weight), such as snapper, bass, or porgy. Cooking times will change depending on the dimensions and weight of the fish you use.\nSeafood Mains\nRoasted Seafood\nBranzino",
