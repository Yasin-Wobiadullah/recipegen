  "full_text": "Dinner Tonight: Thick-Cut Pork Chops With Apples and Onion Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n35 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nbone-in thick-cut pork chops\nSalt\nand\npepper\n1\ntablespoon\nolive oil\n2\ntablespoons\nbutter\n1\nlarge\nwhite onion\n, sliced\n2 to 3\nmedium\napples\n, cored and sliced, about\n3\ncups\n1\ncup\nbeer\n,\nwhite wine\n,\ncider\n, or\nchicken broth\nDirections\nTrim any excess fat from the chops and season liberally with salt and pepper. In a very large, heavy skillet (large enough to hold the chops with room to spare, preferably cast iron), heat the oil over high heat. Once it is shimmering and very hot, add the chops carefully and cook undisturbed for a few minutes for a good sear, about 5 minutes. Turn and sear the other side, then remove the chops to a plate.\nTurn the heat to medium-low and swirl in the butter, then add the apple and onions. Cook until the onion is golden and the apple is softened, 8-10 minutes, then deglaze the pan with the beer or other liquid. Return the chops to the pan and cook, turning occasionally and covering with the sauce, for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the chops are done.\nIf desired, remove the chops and turn the heat to high to thicken the sauce. Serve the chops with the sauce draped over them.\nPork Mains",
