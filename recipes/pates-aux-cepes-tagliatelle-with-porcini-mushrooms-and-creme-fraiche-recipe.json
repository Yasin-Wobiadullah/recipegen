Cover with plastic wrap, and let soak for 30 minutes. Drain the mushrooms well, reserving all soaking liquid, and roughly chop porcinis.\nPreheat broiler on high. In a large bowl, toss porcinis, button mushrooms, thyme, garlic, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Transfer to an oven-proof straight-sided 12-inch saut\u00e9e pan and broil 3 inches below the heat source, tossing every few minutes, until the mushrooms are golden brown, about 15 minutes total.\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. When the mushrooms are broiled, pour in the reserved mushroom liquid and the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and scrape up any bits of mushroom from the bottom of the pan. Keep warm over low heat. Boil the fresh tagliatelle until al dente (about 2 minutes, or according to package instructions). Drain pasta, reserving 2 cups of cooking liquid. Toss the tagliatelle with the mushroom sauce, adding pasta water as needed to moisten. Season to taste with more salt and pepper and serve immediately, topped with parsley and Parmigiano-Reggiano.\nSpecial Equipment\nOven-proof straight-sided 12-inch saut\u00e9e pan\nFrench\nVegetarian Mains\nRoasted Vegetables\nPastas\nMushrooms",
