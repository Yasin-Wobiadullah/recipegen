Do not remove peel. Add bitter orange peel, then pour in gin and vermouth. Seal and shake jar, then steep at room temperature for a minimum of 24 hours and up to 72 hours.\nStrain orange out with a sieve and then filter through cheesecloth or a coffee filter into a glass bottle or jar. Store sealed at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n, cheesecloth or coffee filter\nNotes\nDry bitter orange peel is cheap and many homebrew supply and natural foods stores carry it. While it does make the homemade concoction more closely match a commercial Pimm's, it can easily be left out for the sake of convenience.\nIf you plan to use all of your DIY Pimm's within a week or two, you can simply strain it through a fine-mesh sieve without the additional filtering, since any citrus debris won't be steeping long enough to noticeably affect the flavor. Cheesecloth-filtered homemade Pimm's will keep at room temperature for up to a year.\nRead More\nPimm's Cup Cocktail Recipe\nPimm's and Tonic Recipe\nPimm Daddy Recipe\nThe Pimmlet Recipe\nGin\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines"
