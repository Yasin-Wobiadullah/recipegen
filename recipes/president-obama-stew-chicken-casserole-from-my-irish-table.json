Season them well with salt.\nBrown the chicken:\nIn a large slope-sided saut\u00e9 pan over high heat, heat the canola oil until it shimmers. Arrange all of the chicken evenly in the pan skin-side down and cook for 5 minutes, until golden brown. The pieces should release easily from the bottom of the pan; if they don\u2019t, let them brown longer until they do. Transfer the pieces to a flameproof casserole, arranging them skin-side up.\nSweat the vegetables:\nAdd the onion, carrots, and celery to the saut\u00e9 pan, stirring to combine them. Sweat the vegetables for 4 to 5 minutes, until they are translucent but still a bit firm. As they cook and water releases from them, use a flat-edged wooden spatula to deglaze the pan by scraping up the brown bits from the bottom. Stir in the garlic and then the tomatoes and flour and cook for 2 minutes. Add the bay leaves, serrano chile, chicken stock, thyme, and rosemary.\nCook the stew:\nTransfer the vegetable mixture to the casserole. Bring to a boil, then decrease the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer slowly for 45 to 60 minutes, until the chicken and vegetables are very tender. Remove the stew from the heat. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper if you like. Stir in the basil leaves at the last second before serving. The stew can be made a day before and gently reheated on the stove or in a 300\u00b0F oven for 30 to 40 minutes.\nSoups\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nWhole Chicken"
