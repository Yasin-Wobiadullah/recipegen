Set aside, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved.\nFor the Seeds:\nMeanwhile, place seeds in a clean saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then drain through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the water. Repeat until the discarded water does not taste bitter. This can take between 1 and 8 repetitions.\nTransfer blanched and drained mustard seeds to the pot with the brine. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer and cook until the seeds have plumped up and the liquid has reduced by about one-third, 15 to 20 minutes. Without draining brine, transfer seeds to a sealable container, let cool at room temperature, then seal and refrigerate until ready to use. The seeds will mature in flavor over the course of a few days.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nYou can omit the whiskey. The seeds can be used immediately, but will improve in flavor over time.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPickled mustard seeds can be stored for months in a sealed container in the refrigerator.\nRead More\nSpice Hunting: Mustard Seeds\n48 Homemade Food Gifts for the Holidays\nCondiments & Sauces\nPickling"
