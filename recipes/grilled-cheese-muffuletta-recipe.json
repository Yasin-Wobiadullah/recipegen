Pulse to chop until no pieces larger than 1/2-inch remain. Transfer to a bowl. Add vineger and olive oil and stir to combine. For best results, let olive salad rest overnight before continuing to step 2.\nFor the Sandwich:\nMelt one third of butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat until foaming subsides. Add both bread slices and cook, swirling occasionally, until pale golden brown on bottom side, about 2 minutes.\nTransfer to a cutting board toasted-side-up. Place one cheese slice on top of one slice of bread. Spread a layer of olive salad across bread with a spoon, then top with soppressata, mortadella, and capicola, followed by second cheese slice. Close sandwich, with both toasted sides facing inwards.\nMelt one more piece of butter in the skillet and reduce heat to medium low. Add sandwich and cook, swirling occasionally, until deep, even golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove sandwich using a flexible metal spatula. Add the remaining butter. Return sandwich to skillet cooked-side up. Season with salt. Cook, swirling occasionally, until second side is deep, even golden brown and cheese is thoroughly melted, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSandwiches\nStovetop"
