Continue to whisk, adding in sugar a little at a time. Once sugar has been whisked in, whisk for an additional minute, until mixture is lightened in color. Add milk, cream, salt, and any additional flavoring, extract, or zest. Whisk for an additional 30 seconds, until the mixture is uniform.\nSerious Eats / Lauren Weisenthal\nPlace pieces of bread in a large bowl. If you are adding other ingredients (fruit, nuts, chocolate, etc.) toss them into the bread so it is evenly distributed.
