Uncover skillet and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until cherries are very tender and caramel has thickened to a glaze, about 4 minutes longer.\nAdd kirsch (do not pour directly from the bottle if working over an open flame), then tilt pan to ignite the alcohol from a gas burner, or carefully light with a match. Cook, shaking the pan, until the flames have died out and the caramel has thickened to a glaze, about 1 to 2 minutes. Alternatively, you can add the kirsch and not light it on fire, instead simmering until the alcohol has mostly cooked off and the caramel has reached a glaze consistency.\nAdd vinegar, starting with 1 teaspoon and adding more to taste, if desired, to balance sweetness of sauce. Stir cornstarch slurry to recombine, then add, 1 teaspoon at a time and bringing to a boil between additions, until sauce forms a thickened, honey-like consistency, about 2 minutes.
