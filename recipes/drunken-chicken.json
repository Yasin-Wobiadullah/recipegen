  "full_text": "Drunken Chicken Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nMarinating Time\n24 hrs\nTotal\n24 hrs 30 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nwhole\nchicken parts\n(\n2\nbreasts\n,\n2\nleg/thighs\n, or a mix), totaling about\n2\npounds\nOne\n1-inch piece\nginger\nKosher salt\n1\ncup\nShaoxing\u00a0rice wine\n1\ncup\nchicken broth\n, reserved from simmering\nDirections\nPlace chicken and ginger in a medium saucepan. Add enough cold water to barely cover chicken. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat then reduce to lowest heat. Liquid should be barely quivering. Cook until chicken is cooked through (breasts should register 155\u00b0F/68\u00b0C on an instant-read thermometer and legs should register at least 165\u00b0F/74\u00b0C). Remove each piece as they cook through to a bowl. When all chicken is cooked, pour broth over chicken in bowl.\nLet chicken and broth cool. Chop chicken into 1-inch- to 1/2-inch pieces, depending on the cut of the chicken (breasts should be cut into 1/2-inch pieces against the grain, legs can be cut into 1-inch pieces).\nFind a nonreactive container that snugly fits all chicken pieces. Place all the chicken in the container, taking care not to cram the pieces. Season with salt. Combine chicken broth and wine, and pour over chicken until completely covered. Marinate for at least 24 hours, and up to 5 days. Serve cold, taking out as many pieces of chicken as you need while keeping the rest in the marinade.\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart\nsaut\u00e9 pan\nNotes\nTo learn more about Shaoxing rice wine, check out\nhow to stock a Chinese pantry\n.\nChinese\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nPoached Chicken\nWhole Chicken",
