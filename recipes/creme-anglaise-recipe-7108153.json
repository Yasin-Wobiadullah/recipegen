  "full_text": "Cr\u00e8me Anglaise\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n35 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nTotal\n50 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nMakes\n2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2\ncups\n(\n375\nml\n)\nwhole milk\n1/2\nvanilla\nbean\n, split and scraped, or\n1/4\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\nTwo\n3- by 1-inch strips\norange zest\nfrom\n1\nlarge\norange\n1/8\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for\ntable salt\n, use a pinch\n5\nlarge\negg yolks\n(\n75\ng\n)\n1/4\ncup\n(\n50\ng\n)\ngranulated sugar\nDirections\nIn a 2-quart saucier or saucepan, combine milk, vanilla bean and scraped seeds (or extract), orange zest (if using), and salt. Set over medium-low heat and cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until milk registers 190\u00baF (88\u00baC) on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside to steep for 30 minutes.\nWhen the milk has steeped for 25 minutes, whisk together 1/4 cup (50g) sugar and egg yolks in a medium bowl until sugar is dissolved and mixture turns pale yellow, 2 to 3 minutes. Set a fine-mesh strainer over bowl with egg mixture, and slowly pour one-third of milk mixture into yolk mixture to temper, whisking constantly to prevent yolks from curdling. Add remaining milk mixture, whisking constantly until well-combined; set aside but don\u2019t clean strainer; wipe out saucepan.\nStrain custard through fine-mesh strainer into now-empty saucier; you should have 2 cups of liquid. Return to stovetop; once again set aside but don\u2019t clean strainer, and wipe out bowl. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to prevent egg yolks from curdling, until mixture registers 175\u00baF (79.5\u00baC) on an instant-read thermometer and thickens slightly so that it coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. Working quickly, remove from heat and pour cr\u00e8me anglaise through fine-mesh strainer back into now-empty bowl. Place piece of plastic wrap directly on surface of cr\u00e8me anglaise to prevent skin from forming, and refrigerate until ready to use.\nSpecial Equipment\n2-quart saucier,\ninstant-read thermometer\n, strainer\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe cr\u00e8me anglaise can be made up to 3 days in advance and kept refrigerated.\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nThe Latest\nFrench\nDesserts"
