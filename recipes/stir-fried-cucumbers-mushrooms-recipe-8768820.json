Halve cucumber pieces lengthwise, and then cut cross-wise into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer cucumbers to a medium bowl with 1 teaspoon (4g) salt, and stir until well coated. Let sit until cucumbers release liquid, about 15 minutes. Drain cucumbers, reserving liquid. Strain accumulated liquid in the small bowl with seeds through a fine-mesh strainer into the bowl with reserved liquid from the cucumbers; discard seeds.\nIn a wok or large carbon steel skillet, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over high heat until smoking. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until browned on most sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add reserved cucumber liquid, cover, and cook until mushrooms are tender, about 2 minutes. Uncover, return heat to high, and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is evaporated, about 1 minute longer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and stir in cucumbers. Cook, stirring frequently, until cucumbers begin to brown, about 1 minute. Using blowtorch, hold flame 2 to 3 inches above skillet while stirring constantly, until oil combusts and imparts smoky aroma, about 30 seconds. Stir in garlic and fermented bean curd and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer stir fry to serving platter and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nCarbon steel wok\nor\ncarbon steel skillet\n,\nhigh-output kitchen torch\nNotes\nFermented bean curd in sesame oil can be found in Chinese markets or online.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nWok Skills 101: Stir-Frying Basics\nHow to Clean Shiitake, Portobello, and Oyster Mushrooms\nStir-Fried Cucumbers With Spicy Ground Pork\nThe Comprehensive Mushroom Shopping Guide\nVegetable Stir-Fry\nStovetop Vegetables\nVegetarian Mains",
