Toss to coat. Set aside at room temperature to drain, tossing occasionally until tomatoes release their juices, a minimum of 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.\nDiscard juice from bowl and transfer tomatoes to now-empty large bowl.\nIn a separate bowl, combine shallots and vinegar, and let sit for 5 minutes, stirring halfway through. Pour shallots through a fine-mesh strainer set over a medium bowl (don't discard vinegar). Transfer shallots to large bowl with tomatoes and set aside.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nAdd agave or honey, oregano, mustard, garlic, pepper, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt to bowl with vinegar; whisk until combined. Slowly whisk in olive oil until smooth and emulsified.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nAdd 1/4 cup of vinaigrette to bowl with tomatoes and shallots; toss to combine. Transfer to serving bowl or platter.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nTop with burrata, almonds, and basil. Drizzle remaining vinaigrette evenly over salad. Finish with freshly ground pepper and flaky sea salt, if desired. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nEquipment\nColander, fine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nThis salad is meant to celebrate peak tomato season and won't be nearly as good if made with out-of-season tomatoes. Any ripe tomatoes will work in this salad.\nTomatillos have a sticky layer underneath their husks. To remove this layer, firmly rub tomatillos under running water after removing their husks.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe vinaigrette can be made in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Whisk or shake well in a tightly sealed jar before use.\nThe salad is best when eaten right away, but it can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 hour or refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day before serving. If refrigerating, bring to room temperature before serving and drain any excess liquid that has pooled.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nSides\nVegetable Sides\nTomato",
