(Or pulse a few times in a food processor.) Transfer to a sealable glass jar and pour in the alcohol. Let steep at room temperature for 3 weeks, shaking frequently.\nAfter the initial steeping time, bring sugar and water to a boil at medium heat. Cook until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Let cool completely.\nPour cooled syrup into the steeped mixture, reseal jar, and let rest for an additional 2 weeks, stirring frequently. After 2 weeks, open jar and taste. If stronger flavor is desired, re-seal jar and allow to steep for an additional week.\nStrain through cheesecloth to remove solids, then filter through coffee filter or fresh cheesecloth into a sealable bottle. Store at room temperature for up to 6 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle\nor\nfood processor,\ncheesecloth\nNotes\nGentian root can often be found at Latin markets and specialty herb shops. You can also order it online from companies such as\nLhasa Karnak\n. Use the cut root, which looks like bits of bark, rather than the powdered variety. If you have another bittering agent on hand, such as cinchona bark leftover from\nmaking tonic\n, you can use that as a substitute. If you can't get a high-proof neutral grain spirit like Everclear, use the highest proof vodka you can find.\nCocktails",
