Then slice the fillet halves crosswise into thin strips. Arrange sliced fish on a large plate and sprinkle all over with salt. Cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.\nMeanwhile, blend habanero with water in a blender or with an immersion blender until thoroughly blended. Add lime juice and mint and blend until pureed. Season with salt and pepper.\nIn a mixing bowl, toss arctic char with habanero-lime marinade, jicama, onion, and coriander seed. Season once more with salt and pepper and serve right away with tostadas and avocado.\nNotes\nIf you can't find sashimi-grade arctic char, other sashimi-grade fish such as salmon or scallops will work instead. Habanero peppers are extremely spicy: be careful handling them (don't touch your face), and if possible wear latex gloves.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender or immersion blender\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Aguachile: The Chili-Spiked Mexican Ceviche\nFish\nMexican\nDairy-free Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nNo-Cook Seafood",
