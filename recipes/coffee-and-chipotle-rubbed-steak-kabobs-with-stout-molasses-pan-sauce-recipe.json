Evenly distribute the rub on all sides of the steak, making sure to rub and massage the spices into the meat. Set the meat aside for at least 40 minutes.\nHeat the oil in a large cast-iron pan over moderately high heat. When the oil is shimmering and nearly smoking, place the steaks in the pan and cook until brown and crusty, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Steaks should register 125\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare. Remove the steaks from the pan and rest on a cutting board for at least 10 minutes.\nTo make the pan sauce, pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan. Whisk the flour into the fat in the pan and cook until brown, about 1 minute. Stir in the stout, soy sauce, and molasses and continue to whisk until the sauce is reduced and thickens a bit, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Remove the sauce from the heat.\nCut the rested beef into 1-inch cubes and transfer to a large platter. Drizzle the warm pan sauce over the cubed steaks and serve immediately with toothpicks.\nSpecial Equipment\nCast-iron pan\nRibeyes\nHors D'Oeuvres"
