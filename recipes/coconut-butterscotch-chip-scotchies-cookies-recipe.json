Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside.\nIn a large bowl, beat together butter, coconut sugar, and sugar with a wooden spoon until combined, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla and rum and beat until combined. Add flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. Stir in oats until evenly distributed, then stir in butterscotch chips.\nDrop dough by rounded tablespoon onto prepared baking sheet. Because scotchies spread, I make sure to keep the drops tall, and at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake until golden all over and crisp at the edges, about 15 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes on baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.\nCookies\nBaking\nCoconut"
