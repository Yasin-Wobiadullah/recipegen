  "full_text": "Espresso Tonic\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nServes\n1 serving\nMakes\n1 drink\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nfluid ounces\nchilled\ntonic water\n(120ml), plus more if desired\n1\nfreshly brewed\nshot\nespresso\n(about 1 fluid ounce; 30ml) or other strongly brewed coffee\nSimple syrup\nor oleo-saccharum, to taste (optional, see notes)\nLemon peel\n(optional, see notes)\nDirections\nFill a large glass with ice. Add tonic water to glass. Brew espresso and pour on top. Sweeten to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon at a time) with syrup and/or add more tonic to taste, if desired. Garnish with lemon peel, if desired. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nTonic water is already sweetened, so whether you want additional sweetness, and how much, is up to you. This drink is highly adaptable, so feel free to play with syrups with different flavor profiles: While simple syrup is neutral, other options like\noleo-saccharum\n(lemon syrup), maple syrup, and more can work great.\nGarnishes and flavorings are similarly optional. Lemon peel pairs nicely with this drink, but a couple drops of orange flower water, grapefruit zest, and many other flavorings are possible. Have fun with it!\nCoffee\nThe Latest"
