Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently with a heat-resistant flexible spatula to prevent pasta from sticking. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nImmediately add evaporated milk, stir to combine, and bring to a boil. Add cheese, stir to incorporate, then add 'nduja, continuing to stir to combine.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted, 'nduja is fully emulsified, and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt if necessary ('nduja is quite salty, so pasta shouldn't need any additional salt). Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucier\nor medium saucepan, heat-proof flexible spatula\nNotes\n'Nduja is a spicy spreadable pork salume that originates from the southern Italian region of Calabria. In the US, it can be purchased at specialty shops that carry salumi/charcuterie, Italian markets, or online from producers like\nTempesta Artisan Salumi\n. Look for 'nduja made with just four ingredients: pork, Calabrian chiles, salt, and lactic acid.\nFor a milder and less 'nduja-forward mac and cheese, or if you're looking to make your 'nduja supply last as long as possible, reduce the amount of 'nduja by half, and use just 1 ounce (2 tablespoons; 28g).\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nMacaroni and cheese is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nA Guide to 'Nduja: Italy's Funky, Spicy, Spreadable\nSalume\nPasta With Spicy 'Nduja-Tomato Sauce\nSpicy 'Nduja Mayonnaise\nMac & Cheese\nStovetop Pasta\nCheddar Cheese\nGruyere\nPastas",
