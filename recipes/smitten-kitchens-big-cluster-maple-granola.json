Combine all ingredients but the egg white and dried fruit in a large bowl, tossing to coat evenly. Whisk the egg white in a small bowl until frothy. Stir into the granola mixture, distributing it throughout. Spread it in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet.\nBake for 45 to 55 minutes. About halfway through the baking time, use a large spatula to turn over sections of the granola carefully, breaking them up as little as possible. Rotate the pan if granola is baking unevenly. When it is evenly browned and feels dry to the touch, transfer the pan from the oven to the cooling rack. Cool completely. Once it\u2019s completely cool, break up granola into whatever size clusters delight you. Sprinkle in dried fruit.\nThe granola keeps at room temperature in an airtight container for 2 weeks. It keeps even longer in the freezer, if you\u2019re the stockpiling type.\nGranola\nEgg Whites\nCoconut\nWalnuts\nOats",
