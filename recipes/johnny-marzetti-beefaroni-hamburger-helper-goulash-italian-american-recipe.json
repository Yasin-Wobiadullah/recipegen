Season generously with salt. Let rest, stirring twice during the first 10 minutes, while you prepare the other ingredients.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nUsing a hand blender directly in the tomato jar or a regular countertop blender, process tomatoes until mostly smooth. Set aside.\nHeat oil and butter in a 5-quart straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, swirling, until butter is mostly melted. Add onions and peppers, reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 7 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and half of parsley, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nClear a space in the center of the pan and add meat. Increase heat to high. Cook, breaking it up first with a wooden spoon, then with a potato masher, until broken into small pieces. Continue cooking until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Add pur\u00e9ed\u00a0tomatoes and bring to a simmer.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nDrain noodles in a large colander set in the sink. Add to pot with beef. Add Worcestershire sauce and chicken stock and stir, folding noodles through the sauce until noodles and sauce are well-integrated.

Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add half of cubed mozzarella and stir to incorporate rapidly (do not overstir or the mixture will stretch and stick to your spoon). Spread remaining mozzarella over surface of dish. Sprinkle half of Parmesan over dish. Cover and cook over the lowest possible heat for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest with cover on for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / J.

Make the sauce as directed through step 4. Add Worcestershire sauce directly to sauce, but omit chicken broth. In a large pot, boil the macaroni until half-cooked. Drain and add to the sauce. Transfer mixture to a large casserole dish. Stir in half the mozzarella, top with the remaining mozzarella and half the Parmesan, and bake in a 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) oven until pasta is fully cooked, sauce is bubbling, and cheese is fully melted, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, top with remaining Parmesan and herbs, let rest five minutes, and serve passing extra Worcestershire sauce on the side.\nRead More\n46 Saucy Italian Pasta Dishes You Should Know and Love\n27 Quick and Easy Pasta Recipes\nChinese-American\nItalian-American\nGround Beef\nTomato\nTomato Sauces",
