In a 4-cup liquid measuring cup or large bowl, whisk water, milk, egg, and sugar until sugar is dissolved.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nUsing a dough hook on low speed, slowly drizzle water mixture into flour mixture and mix, scraping down bowl as needed, until cohesive dough forms and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. With mixer running, add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, waiting until the butter is fully incorporated into the dough before adding the next tablespoon, until all butter is fully incorporated, about 3 minutes. Increase mixer speed to medium and knead for 8 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl but still sticks to the bottom.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand to form a smooth round ball, about 1 minute. In a lightly greased large bowl, place the dough seam side down, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or a large plate, and let rise at room temperature, 68 to 74\u2109 (20 to 23 \u2103), until the dough is doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nLine 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Press down on dough to deflate and transfer the dough to a clean work surface. Using a bench scraper or sharp knife, divide dough in 6 equal pieces (about 145g each). Shape each piece into a smooth ball and set aside on the counter. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap or a kitchen towel.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nWorking with one dough ball at a time, use your hands to flatten ball into a 5- x 4-inch rectangle. Fold the upper third of the dough toward the center. Fold the lower third of the dough to the center, mimicking an envelope fold, and lightly pinch the edges of both folded pieces together and press gently to seal the center seam where the folds meet. Then press the new seam into the bun, so it almost disappears.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nRoll the bun over, seamside down, and using the palms of your hands, gently roll the bun into a 7 \u00bd inch log. Repeat with the remaining dough balls, recovering the unused pieces with the greased wrap or kitchen towel. Once all are shaped, using your hands, roll each log again so they each are now 8 \u00bd inches long and even thickness from end to end.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375\u2109(190\u2103).\u00a0Transfer 4 buns to one prepared baking sheet seam-side down, and 2 to the other sheet; Set the puns side by side in pairs with 1 inch of space between each bun in the pair. Using a pastry brush, brush buns lightly with vegetable oil and cover loosely with a kitchen towel or greased plastic wrap and proof at room temperature until puffed, and are\u00a09-inches in length, and dough springs back minimally when poked gently with your knuckle, 30 to 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nUsing a pastry brush, brush proofed buns with the prepared egg wash. Bake buns until golden brown for about 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nFor steaming the hot dogs:\nBring 1 1/2 cup water to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Place steamer basket over boiling water. Add hot dogs to basket, cover saucepan, and reduce heat to medium. Cook until hot dogs are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nFor assembly with the toppings:\nSlice each bun open lengthwise, leaving hinge attached. Transfer buns to a rimmed baking sheet and warm in the oven until just warmed through.\nFill each bun with 1 1/2 steamed or grilled hot dogs (the idea is to fill the whole length of the bun). Serve with the suggested toppings, letting each person assemble their own completos. (Serving suggestions below.)\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nFor completos Italianos:\nTop each hot dog with 3 to 5 tablespoons diced tomatoes, 3 tablespoons mashed avocado, and at least 2 tablespoons mayonnaise.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nFor completos completos:\nTop each hot dog with 3 to 4 tablespoons sauerkraut and/or 2 to 3 tablespoons diced giardinera, 3 to 5 tablespoons diced tomatoes, and at least 2 tablespoons mayonnaise.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer with paddle attachment (if making the buns), large saucepan, steamer basket\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBaked rolls can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or wrapped individually and frozen for up to 2 months. Warm through before using.\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nSausages\nSouth American",
