Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicon mat; set aside.\nCream butter and brown sugar together in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until blended.\nIn a medium bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg; set aside.\nIn a small bowl, combine the oil, molasses, and sour cream.\nAlternately mix the flour mixture and molasses mixture into the creamed butter until all ingredients are combined.\nDrop tablespoons of batter about 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when touched in the center. Cool completely on a wire rack before adding filling.\nMake the Filling:\nCombine sugar, water, tea bags, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to make sure the sugar dissolves, then simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the syrup steep another 20 minutes. Remove the cardamom pods and cinnamon sticks, squeeze out all the flavor from the tea bags, and discard all solids. Let the syrup come to room temperature before proceeding.\nUsing a food processor or a mixer, combine the butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, honey, and spiced syrup until very smooth. For best results, refrigerate the filling overnight to allow the flavors to come together. Add a rounded tablespoon of the filling on the center of the flat side of each finished cake. Top with the flat side of another cake and press together slightly.\nCookies\nChristmas Cookies",
