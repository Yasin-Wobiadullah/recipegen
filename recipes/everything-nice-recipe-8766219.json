(You can prewarm it by pouring hot water into it, letting it stand for 1 minute, then draining.) Using a spoon, dollop whipped cream on top of coffee and top with freshly grated nutmeg, if using. Serve right away. (You may have more whipped cream than the mug can accommodate; feel free to add more as you drink, or use some for the next round.)\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nNotes\nTo make a 2:1 simple syrup, combine 1/2 cup (120g) granulated sugar with 1/4 cup (60ml) water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring, until sugar is fully dissolved. You can add the syrup hot, since the drink is hot; any extra can be stored in the refrigerator up to three months, and often longer.\nRead More\nJust-Do-Ya (Hazelnut-Spiked Irish Coffee With Chocolate Whipped Cream)\nWake Me Up Before You Go-Go (Fernet-Spiked Irish Coffee With Lemon Cream)\nCocktails\nCoffee\nWinter Drinks\nDrinks"
