Meanwhile, season beef all over with salt.\nWorking in batches, add just enough beef to the pan to sear it heavily without steaming in its own juices. Spread the beef around so the pieces are evenly spaced apart and allow to cook until very well seared and charred on one side, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir and toss beef so that it cooks all over, about 30 seconds longer; if you are working over a gas flame and aren't afraid of some fire, toss the beef near the flame so that the oil briefly combusts in big bursts. (If this makes you nervous, don't allow it to catch fire. Instead, manage the heat to prevent flare-ups.) Using a spatula, transfer beef to a platter to rest. Repeat with remaining beef, always getting the pan smoking-hot before the next batch and adding more oil if needed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen all the beef is cooked, return the empty pan to high heat. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and heat until smoking. Working in batches, add just enough red onion so that it sears and browns rapidly without steaming, about 30 seconds. Toss a few times until the onion is crisp-tender. Using a spatula, transfer onion to a platter. Repeat with remaining onion, always heating the pan until smoking first and adding more oil if necessary.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReturn the empty pan to high heat, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil, and heat until smoking. Working in batches if necessary, add scallions and cook, without stirring, until seared on bottom side, about 30 seconds. Push scallions to the side and add peppers. Cook until seared, about 30 seconds longer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPush scallions and peppers to the side and add tomatoes to the pan, allowing them to sear on one side, about 30 seconds. (If your burner isn't very strong, you can remove the scallions and peppers from the pan before adding the tomatoes to guarantee good searing. Otherwise, leave them in.) Try not to let the tomatoes grow too soft and pulpy; it's better that they retain their shape rather than brown to the point of becoming mushy.\nAdd garlic and ginger and cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until lightly saut\u00e9ed and fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add soy sauce and vinegar and toss to combine.\nReturn beef and all accumulated juices to the pan along with the red onions. (If you've removed the scallions and peppers, add them back now, too.) Add cilantro. Toss over high heat to combine well, seasoning with salt and pepper as you go. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpoon stir-fry onto plates with a mound of cooked rice and French fries and serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nNotes\nAj\u00ed amarillo peppers are fruity and floral, and they pack a good dose of heat. If you can't find fresh ones, good Latin groceries will often stock frozen whole ones in the freezer section. Alternatively, you can use a similar quantity of red bell pepper and jalape\u00f1o.\nRead More\nEasy Stir-Fried Beef With Mushrooms and Butter\nSpicy Stir-Fried Beef With Leeks and Onions\nSalchipapa (Peruvian Hot Dogs and French Fries)\nBeef Stir-Fry\nPeruvian\nSkirt Steaks\nTenderloin Steak\nBeef Mains"
