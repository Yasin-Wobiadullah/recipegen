Add asparagus in as close to a single layer as possible, season with salt and pepper, and cook without moving until lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Shake pan and cook until browned again, 1 1/2 minutes longer. Add stock and butter to pan and immediately cover.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nContinue to cook until asparagus is completely tender and stock and butter have emulsified and reduced to a shiny glaze, 7 to 10 minutes. If stock completely evaporates and butter starts to burn before asparagus is cooked through, top up with a few tablespoons of water. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpecial Equipment\nSaut\u00e9 pan\nRead More\nThe Food Lab: All About Asparagus\nAsparagus\nBraised & Stewed Vegetables\nQuick Sides\nVegetable Sides"
