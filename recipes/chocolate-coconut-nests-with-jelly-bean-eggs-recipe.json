  "full_text": "Chocolate Coconut Nests With Jelly Bean Eggs Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n5 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nChilling Time\n15 mins\nTotal\n25 mins\nServes\n6 nests\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nounces\nfinely chopped\nmilk chocolate\n, or semi-sweet chocolate,\nor\nwhite chocolate (see note)\n2/3\ncup\nunsweetened dessicated\u00a0coconut\nDash\ngreen food coloring\n, optional (see note)\n18 to 24\nsmall\njelly beans\nDirections\nLine a baking sheet or large plate with parchment paper. In a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water, melt half of chocolate, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in remaining chocolate until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.\nStir in coconut until completely combined. Drop rounded tablespoons of mixture onto prepared pan, keeping the shape as round as possible, and spacing 2 inches apart. Using the back of a 1/2 teaspoon, gently press into center of each mound to create a slight crater. Gently press 3 or 4 jelly beans into center and chill until set, about 15 minutes.\nNotes\nIf you decide to make nests with multiple types of chocolate, start with white chocolate first, then move on to milk chocolate, then move on to dark chocolate. This will allow you to use the same bowl over again without cleaning between batches.\nIf making the white chocolate version: before adding coconut, add a dash of green food coloring until desired shade of green is achieved.\nRead More\nThe Best Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons\nDouble Chocolate Coconut Macaroons\nEaster Desserts\nChocolate\nCoconut",
