Cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes, until warm to the touch. Increase heat to medium, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, and cook until steaming hot, about 8 minutes or to 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C). Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a large stainless steel bowl, pressing gently with a flexible spatula to release the liquid trapped in the crumbs.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFill a sink compartment or extra-large bowl with a few inches of ice water and place bowl with custard inside, stirring from time to time, until cool, about 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), about 4 hours. (The ice cream base can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week.) Stir in whiskey, if using, and vanilla and season to taste with more salt if desired. Churn in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen ice cream looks thick and light, shut off the machine and scrape ice cream into chilled container, using chilled spatula. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until hard, about 4 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel\nsaucier\n,\nflexible spatula\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n, stainless steel\nmixing bowl\n,\nice cream maker\nNotes\nWhile there's no harm in using plain sugar, this recipe benefits from the caramel flavor and diminished sweetness of\ntoasted sugar\n. If you like, you can\nquick-toast sugar\nin just 30 minutes, or use the\nlightly toasted sugar\nleft over from\npre-baking a pie\n.\nRead More\nSpeculoos-Stroopwafel Ice Cream Recipe\nGingerbread Ice Cream Recipe\nCoffee 'N Cookies 'N Cream Ice Cream Recipe\nHomemade Biscoff (Belgian Speculoos Cookies) Recipe\nSpeculoos (Biscoff Cookie Butter) Recipe\nIce Cream\nDairy Milk\nMemorial Day\nSummer Desserts",
