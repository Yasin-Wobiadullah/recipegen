  "full_text": "The Nasty Bits: Omasum Salad Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nOne\n3-pound section\nof\nomasum\n3\nlarge\ngreen onions\n, thinly sliced\nApproximately\n1/4\ncup\nchopped cilantro\n1/3\ncup\nolive oil\n2\ntablespoons\nmedium-\ndark soy sauce\nDirections\nDivide the omasum into sections, each with 4 to 5 translucent sections in the interior. Slice each section into 1/4 inch slices so that each section gets a corresponding tendril.\nBring a medium-large pot of water to boil. Add the tripe all at once and parboil for 40 seconds, at which point the water will be just about ready to boil again. Drain the tripe and refresh under cold water until the slices have completely cooled down. These sections are now ready to be dressed.\nAdd the parboiled and rinsed tripe to the oil. The tripe should be fairly dry so that no additional water makes it into the dressing. Toss and let sit for 10 minutes, or keep in the refrigerator for several days. Serve cold.\nChinese\nBeef Liver & Organ Meats\nSalads"
