In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Working in batches to prevent crowding, add half the turkey pieces skin side down and cook, turning occasionally and lowering heat as needed to prevent skin from burning, until golden brown all over, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and repeat browning process with remaining turkey pieces. Set aside.\nAdd bacon to now-empty Dutch oven and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lardons are crisp and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add half the butter (4 tablespoons; 56g), garlic, onion, and ginger. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot, until vegetables are slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes.\nPour in sake, bring to a boil, and cook until liquid has mostly evaporated, about 1 minute. Add chicken stock, root beer, soy sauce, dried shiitakes, and jujubes, and bring to a boil. Add turkey parts along with any accumulated juices to the pot, nestling them in so they are mostly submerged. Lower heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes.\nAdd radishes and carrots in a single layer on top of the turkey pieces so that vegetables are partially submerged. Continue to cook until vegetables are tender and turkey is cooked through and pulls easily off the bone, about 45 minutes longer. Remove from heat.\nUsing a spider or slotted spoon, transfer turkey pieces to a plate. Once cool enough to handle, pick meat from the bones into large bite-size pieces; discard bones. Set picked turkey meat aside.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 1/4 cup (60ml) cold water to form a smooth slurry. Return Dutch oven to stovetop and bring braising liquid back to a boil over medium-high heat. Whisk in cornstarch slurry and cook, whisking constantly, until liquid thickens to the point that it can coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in chestnuts, turkey, and remaining 4 tablespoons (56g) butter. Continue to cook until turkey is warmed through and butter is fully emulsified, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nIf serving right away, divide jjim between individual serving bowls, sprinkle with pine nuts (if using), and serve. If making in advance, allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days; reheat over medium heat before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge Dutch oven\nNotes\nThis recipe calls for turkey leg quarters and wings, which can be purchased separately (you can even do without the wings if serving fewer people), or you can buy a whole 10- to 12-pound turkey and\nbreak down the bird yourself\n, using the legs, wings (and neck, if available) for this recipe, while reserving the crown for another dish, such as\nroast turkey breast ssam\n.\nIf you can't find slab bacon for this recipe, thick-cut sliced bacon will work as well.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTurkey jjim can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container (without the pine nuts) for up to 5 days; reheat over medium heat and sprinkle with pine nuts before serving.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCelebrate the Sides With a Korean-American Banchan Thanksgiving\nTurkey\nKorean\nBraising & Stewing\nBraised & Stewed Turkey"
