Season with a pinch of kosher salt, black pepper, ground cumin, smoked paprika, and garlic powder. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking; set aside or refrigerate until ready to serve.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nFor the Tostones:\nIn a deep 10-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet, add oil and heat oil over medium-high heat to 325\u00baF (160\u2103).\nWhile the oil is preheating, peel the plantains by cutting off the ends and carefully cutting a slit down the sides of each plantain, cutting through the skin but not into the flesh. Remove the skin and then cut the fruit crosswise into 1-inch long chunks.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nWhen oil reaches 325\u00baF (160\u2103), add half of the plantain chunks and fry until golden and fork tender, adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature around 300 to 325\u00baF (150 to 160\u2103), 7 to 8 minutes, flipping over as needed to ensure even color. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the plantain chunks from the oil and transfer them to a cutting board.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nUsing a tostonera (plantain press) or tortilla press, smash each plantain chunk until flattened and about 1/4 -inch thick (see notes). Repeat frying and smashing the remaining plantain chunks, setting the flattened ones aside to be fried again.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nHeat oil to 350\u00baF (175\u2103), add half of the flattened plantains back into the oil and fry for a second time until golden all over and starting to float, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider skimmer to remove the tostones and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Return oil to 375\u00baF (175\u2103) and repeat frying process with remaining flattened plantains.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nOnce all are fried, immediately season with a large pinch of kosher salt and garlic powder, and toss to combine. Transfer tostones to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet to drain any excess oil.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nServe tostones with prepared sauce.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nSpecial Equipment\nTostonera (plantain press) or tortilla press or heavy-bottomed glass or mug, slotted spoon or spider skimmer, wire rack and rimmed baking sheet, instant-read or deep-fry thermometer\nNotes\nThis recipe is very easy to scale up or down.\nIf a plantain press or tortilla press are unavailable, you can use the flat bottom of a heavy-bottomed glass or mug to flatten the tostones.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe sauce can be refrigerated for up to 7 days. Tostones are best enjoyed fresh and hot.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nThe Latest\nFrying\nCaribbean\nPlantains",
