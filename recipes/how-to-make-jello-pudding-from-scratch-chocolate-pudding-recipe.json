  "full_text": "Homemade Jell-O Style Chocolate Pudding Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n5 mins\nActive\n5 mins\nChilling Time\n2 hrs 15 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 25 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/4\nounce\npowdered gelatin\n14 1/2\nounces\nmilk,\ndivided\n5\nounces\nsugar\n3/4\nounce\ncocoa powder\n1/2 to 3/4\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\n, half as much if iodized\n2\nteaspoons\nvanilla extract\nDirections\nIn a medium bowl, combine gelatin and 2 1/2 ounces milk. Whisk with a fork to ensure no lumps remain.\nIn a small sauce pot, combine sugar, cocoa, salt, and remaining milk over medium-low heat. Whisk constantly until smooth and the mixture begins to bubble around the edges, about 5 minutes.\nPour the hot dairy mixture through a sieve into bowl of gelatin. Whisk gelatin into chocolate mixture. Stir in vanilla, and season with additional salt if needed (I've discovered the amount needed will vary according to the bitterness of the cocoa powder, which varies between brand and type).\nSet the bowl, uncovered, in the refrigerator. After 15 minutes, cover the pudding with a sheet of plastic wrap pressed against the surface and refrigerate until fully thickened, about 2 hours.\nTo serve: Whip the thickened pudding with a hand or stand mixer for a full minute to restore its creamy texture. (Alas, stirring or beating with a spatula alone will not sufficiently break up the pudding into a creamy, homogeneous mixture.) Spoon whipped pudding into 4 serving dishes.\nIf all the pudding is not eaten at this time, it will be necessary to re-whip the pudding before serving, as prolonged refrigeration creates an unpleasantly firm texture.\nNotes\nAll measurements are in weights, as volume measures can be very imprecise. I strongly recommend using a\nscale\nfor all pastry projects.\nThe flavor of this pudding changes dramatically depending on the ingredients used. Skim milk makes a pudding with the lighter taste and texture of the \"low-fat\" puddings whereas whole milk gives the full flavor of the original. High-end fancy cocoa powders like Valrhona will result in a really dynamic, flavorful chocolate pudding, whereas grocery store staples like Hershey's will have a simpler flavor more in line with the taste of the pudding you remember.\nSpecial Equipment\nSauce pot, whisk, sieve,\nkitchen scale\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nGluten-free Desserts\nChocolate",
