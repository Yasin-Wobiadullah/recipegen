Add chicken broth until mostly covered (you may not need all of it, depending on how big your pot is). Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and cook until completely tender, 4 to 6 hours depending on the size of the tongue, adding extra water as necessary to keep the tongue mostly submerged.\nCarefully remove tongue to a cutting board. Strain stock and discard solids, reserving liquid for another use. Peel the outer membrane off the tongue and discard. Roughly chop tongue into 1/2-inch pieces. Tongue can be prepared up through this step up to 5 days in advance. Store in an airtight container or zipper-lock bag in the fridge.\nWhen ready to serve, heat fat in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tongue pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until tongue is well-browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes total. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nTo serve, wrap a spoonful or two of tongue in a double layer of corn tortillas. Top as desired.\nNotes\nPork or lamb's tongue can be used in place of beef.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe tongue can be braised and trimmed up to 5 days in advance. Refrigerate in an airtight container or zipper-lock bag.\nRead More\nSous Vide Tacos de Lengua\nCemitas de Lengua (Mexican Tongue Sandwiches)\nVery Crispy Tongue with Chili Bean Paste and Sichuan Peppercorns\nCrispy Grilled Beef Tongue\nThe Comfort Food Diaries: A Trick of the Tongue\nTacos\nMexican\nBeef\nCinco de Mayo"
