  "full_text": "Shortbread Sandwiches Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nCooling Time\n15 mins\nTotal\n70 mins\nServes\n15 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\n(about\n10\nounces\n)\nall-purpose flour\n1/2\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\n2\nsticks\n(\n8\nounces\n)\nunsalted butter\n, at room temperature\n1/2\ncup\n(about\n3 1/2\nounces\n)\nsugar\n1/4\ncup\njam\n,\nNutella\n,\npeanut butter\n, or\nchocolate ganache\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to upper middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Butter an 8-inch springform pan. In a small bowl, whisk together flour and salt; set aside. In the bowl of a food processor, process butter until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add sugar and pulse for 1 minute. Add flour mixture and pulse just until dough comes together.\nDivide dough into two equal portions. Press one half of dough into bottom of prepared pan until even. Spread with filling of choice, leaving 1/3-inch border at edge of pan. On a lightly floured surface, roll second half of dough out into 8-inch circle. Transfer to pan and place on top of filling. Gently press down on edge of dough to seal. Bake until golden, about 45 minutes.\nLet cookies rest in pan for 15 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. When cool, cut into wedges or squares.\nNotes\nI like to use my food processor for this recipe, but you can also use an electric beater. Simply cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.\nSpecial Equipment\n8-inch\nspringform pan\n,\nfood processor\nor\nhand mixer\n,\nrolling pin\nCookies\nDessert Bars\nChristmas Cookies",
