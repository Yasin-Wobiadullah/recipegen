Put the meat strips into this marinade and turn everything over with your hands. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to blend and penetrate the meat.\nThe next day, heat the oven to 175\u00b0F. Line 2 baking pans with foil. Arrange the meat strips side by side on the pans, discarding any bits of garlic and blotting off any liquid clinging to the meat.\nSlow-roast the strips for 3 hours, then turn them over and roast for another hour or two more. The goal is a leathery texture that is\nstill pliable\n. The jerky will keep, refrigerated, for 3 weeks. It is stable enough to pack in lunches or for trips as long as a day without refrigeration.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nRoasted Beef\nBeef",
