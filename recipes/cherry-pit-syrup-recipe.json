Toss until well combined, then cover tightly and set aside for 3 hours or up to 24 hours. Shake bowl or jar occasionally to toss pits around and help sugar dissolve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen sugar has completely dissolved, strain syrup through a fine-mesh sieve. (The pits will still have enough flavor left to make a batch of\ncherry pit whipped cream\n, if you'd like to arm yourself with the perfect set of toppings for a cherry sundae.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSeason syrup with a pinch of salt and a drop or two of rose water and/or almond extract to taste. Please use care in adding these potent ingredients; while a very small amount of each can go a long way toward balancing the flavor of the syrup, the effect can be overwhelming if too much is added.\nTransfer syrup to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 month. Use as a dessert sauce or as a replacement for simple syrup in drinks.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nNonreactive fine-mesh sieve\nNotes\nIf you're using sweet cherries, it may help to include the empty husk of a juiced lime as part of the weight listed for the pits, to furnish the syrup with a bit of acidity to balance the sweetness of the fruit and sugar. Adding juice to taste at the end will only dilute the syrup and shorten its shelf life, while maceration with the rind will draw out both acidity and a pleasant hint of bitterness to balance the syrup.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one month.\nRead More\nHow to Store Cherries\nBrandied Cocktail Cherries\nSyrup\nVegan Desserts\nNo-Cook Fruit\nCherry\nCocktails",
