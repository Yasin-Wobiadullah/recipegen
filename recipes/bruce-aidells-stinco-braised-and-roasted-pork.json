Soak for at least 45 minutes, or up to several hours. Remove the mushrooms from the liquid with a slotted spoon. Chop and set aside. Strain the soaking liquid with a fine-mesh strainer, leaving behind any grit in the bottom of the bowl, and set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C). Tie each shank with 3 loops of butcher's twine. Generously season the shanks with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the shanks (you may have to brown them in batches) and sear until nicely browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Set aside the shanks and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat.\nReduce the heat to medium and add the prosciutto, onions, carrots, celery, and leeks. Cover and cook until soft, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the garlic, reserved mushrooms, and white wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any remaining browned bits from the bottom. Add the reserved mushroom liquid, the stock, 1 teaspoon of the sage, 1 teaspoon of the rosemary, and the shanks. Bring to a boil.\nCover and bake for 30 minutes, then turn the shanks, re-cover the pot, and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove the lid and, after another 30 minutes, begin checking the shanks, adding more stock or water if the liquid evaporates. The shanks are done when the meat is almost falling off the bone and is quite tender.\nTransfer the pot to the top of the stove and transfer the shanks to a shallow roasting pan. Increase the oven temperature to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Brush the shanks with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with some pepper and the remaining 2 teaspoons sage and 1 teaspoon rosemary. Roast the shanks in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until slightly browned.\nMeanwhile, degrease the braising liquid in the pot and, if necessary, boil it down until it just turns syrupy. Season to taste with salt and pepper. To serve, remove and discard the twine, cut chunks of meat from the shanks, transfer to plates, and ladle on some of the sauce. Pass the extra sauce at the table.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n, shallow\nroasting pan\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n, butcher's twine\nRead More\nOsso Buco (Italian Braised Veal Shanks) Recipe\nRed Wine-Braised Beef Shanks Recipe\nSlow-Cooker Beef Shank Osso Buco With Lemon-Parsley Gremolata Recipe\nPork\nItalian\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nRoasted Pork\nPork Mains",
