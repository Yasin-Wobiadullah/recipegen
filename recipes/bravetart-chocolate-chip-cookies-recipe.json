Set aside a handful of chopped chocolate (about 2 ounces; 55g) and place the remainder in a medium bowl. Sift flour on top and toss together. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With mixer running, add egg and continue beating only until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour/chocolate all at once, and mix to form a stiff dough.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPortion the Dough:\nDivide in 2-tablespoon portions (about 1 1/2 ounces or 40g each) and round each one into a smooth ball. (If you like, portioned dough can be refrigerated in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70\u00b0F or 21\u00b0C, and proceed as directed.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Bake:\nArrange portions on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving 2 inches between cookies to account for spread. Garnish each with reserved chocolate and a pinch of kosher salt. Bake until puffed and pale gold around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 15 minutes. For crunchy cookies, continue baking until golden, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes. Enjoy warm or store in an airtight container up to 2 days at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nflexible spatula\n, 2-tablespoon portion scoop (optional),\nrimmed baking sheets\nNotes\nWith kitchen temperatures above 74\u00b0F (23\u00b0C), start by refrigerating the mixing bowl and dry ingredients until cooled to 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). At elevated temperatures, these ingredients and equipment can act as a heat source to the butter, warming the dough and causing excessive spread in the oven.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe portioned dough can be refrigerated in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70\u00b0F or 21\u00b0C, and proceed as directed. Though these chocolate chip cookies are best enjoyed warm, they can be kept for up to 2 days in an airtight container at room temperature.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's Chocolate Chip Cookies\nCocoa Butter Cookies With Chocolate Chips\nLevain Bakery-Style Super-Thick Chocolate Chip Cookies\nTate's-Style Thin and Crispy Chocolate Chip Cookies\nThe Best Chocolate for Baking\nCookies\nChocolate\nChristmas Cookies"
