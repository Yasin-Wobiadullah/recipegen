  "full_text": "These 3-Ingredient, One-Bowl Moroccan Doughnuts Are Crispy, Golden, and Delightfully Chewy\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n30 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nProofing Time:\n2 hrs\nTotal\n2 hrs 55 mins\nServes\n10\nMakes\n10 sfenj\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n480\ng\nall-purpose flour\n(\n17\nounces\n;\n3 3/4\ncups\n)\n1\ntablespoon\ninstant\nyeast\n1 1/4\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal kosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\n1\nteaspoon\ngranulated sugar\n380\nml\nwarm\nwater\n(\n1 1/2\ncups\nplus\n2\ntablespoons\n)\nNeutral oil\nsuch as vegetable or canola oil for frying\nCooking spray\nGranulated sugar\nor honey, for serving\nDirections\nFit stand mixer with a dough hook. To the bowl of stand mixer, add flour, yeast, salt, and sugar and whisk to combine.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nMixing on low speed, slowly pour in water until a shaggy dough forms, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and very elastic, but still sticky and loose, about 10 minutes. Stop and scrape down sides of the bowl as needed while mixing.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nLightly oil a large bowl, then transfer dough to oiled bowl. Flip dough to coat in oil, then cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nAllow dough to rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Alternatively, let the dough rise at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes, then refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours (dough will be doubled to tripled in size). Remove dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before shaping and frying.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nSet up two pans for frying side by side:\nIn a high-sided large skillet, pour oil to measure 1/2 inch deep and heat oil over medium-high heat until it registers 325\u2109 (160\u2103). At the same time, in a large Dutch oven or large pot, pour oil to measure 2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat until oil registers 350\u2109 (175\u2103). Adjust and monitor oil temperatures as needed.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nWhile oil is heating, shape the sfenj:\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and grease with cooking spray; set aside. Lightly oil your hands. (Do not punch down or deflate dough\u2014you want to preserve the air bubbles.) Divide dough into 10 equal portions. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time on a lightly floured counter to prevent sticking, gently shape each portion of dough into a rough ball. To form the sfenj, poke a hole into the center of each portion with a fingertip, then gently stretch into a 3 1/2-inch ring, oiling hands as needed to prevent sticking. Make sure you stretch the dough when shaping it into a ring because it will quickly shrink when placed into the hot oil. Transfer shaped sfenj to prepared lined rimmed baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nFor Frying:\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with a triple layer of paper towels; set aside. Carefully place 2 shaped sfenj into the shallow pan of 325\u2109 (160\u2103) oil and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until the bottom firms up, its surface puffs up, and its edges look dry. Do not flip.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nUsing a slotted spoon or spider skimmer, carefully transfer the partially cooked sfenj to the deeper 350\u2109 (175\u2103) frying oil. Fry until golden and crispy on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Use a slotted spoon or spider skimmer to remove from hot oil, letting excess oil drip back into pot, then transfer to prepared baking sheet. Return both pots of oil to their original starting temperatures and repeat frying, 2 at a time, adjusting temperature as needed to maintain 325\u2109 (160\u2103) and 350\u2109 (175\u2103) oil until all sfenj are fried (5 batches for 10 doughnuts total).\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nSprinkle warm sfenj with granulated sugar or drizzle with honey before serving.\nSerious Eats / Debbie Wee\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer with dough hook attachment, high-sided large skillet, large Dutch oven or large pot, thermometer for frying\nMakes-Ahead and Storage\nThe fried doughnuts are best enjoyed fresh while hot, but will hold for up to 8 hours at room temperature.\nThe dough can be refrigerated to proof slowly for 8 to 12 hours before shaping and frying.\nRecipes\nThe Latest\nBreakfast & Brunch\nDoughnuts\nMoroccan"
