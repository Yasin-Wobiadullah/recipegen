In a carbon-steel wok or 12-inch carbon steel skillet, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons (7ml) oil over high heat until smoking. Add half of the rice, season lightly with salt and white pepper, and cook, stirring and tossing, until rice is pale brown, toasted, and has a slightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer rice to a medium heatproof bowl. Repeat cooking process with another 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and remaining rice. Set rice aside in bowl.\nTim Chin\nHeat 2 teaspoons (10ml) oil in now-empty wok over high heat until smoking. Add lettuce, season lightly with salt, white pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon seasoning granules, and cook, stirring and tossing, until beginning to wilt, about 15 seconds. If using blowtorch, hold flame 2 to 3 inches above wok while stirring and tossing constantly, until oil combusts and imparts smoky aroma, about 30 seconds. Set aside in bowl with rice.\nTim Chin\nHeat 2 teaspoons (10ml) oil in now-empty wok over high heat until smoking. Add eggs, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring gently until just cooked through, about 45 seconds. Using spoon, break up eggs into small pieces. Transfer cooked eggs to bowl with rice and lettuce.\nTim Chin\nHeat remaining 2 teaspoons (10ml) oil in now-empty wok over high heat until smoking. Add garlic and cook until just fragrant, about 10 seconds. Stir in shrimp and season with salt, pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon (2g) seasoning powder. If using blowtorch, hold flame 2 to 3 inches above skillet while stirring and tossing constantly, until oil combusts and imparts smoky aroma, about 30 seconds. Continue cooking shrimp until just cooked through, about 1 minute longer.\nTim Chin\nAdd rice, lettuce, and eggs and toss to combine. Add frozen peas and scallions and continue to toss and stir until peas are thawed and every grain of rice is separate. If using blowtorch, hold flame 2 to 3 inches above skillet while stirring and tossing constantly, until oil combusts and imparts smoky aroma, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and additional seasoning powder to taste. Serve.\nTim Chin\nSpecial Equipment\nCarbon steel wok\nor 12-inch\ncarbon steel skillet\n, high-output kitchen torch (optional).\nNotes\nFor best results, use Chinese-style medium-grain rice, jasmine rice, or sushi rice. Rice should either be cooked fresh, spread on a tray, and allowed to cool for five minutes, or, alternatively, cooked in advance and refrigerated in a covered container for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days.\nIf you can\u2019t find Totole Granulated Chicken Soup Mix, you can substitute any other chicken broth powder, such as Orrington Farms Chicken Broth powder.\nChinese\nShrimp\nSeafood Stir-Fry\nThe Latest"
