Lightly grease a 1-pound aluminum loaf pan and dust with flour. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine sugar, butter, coconut oil, baking powder, salt, and vanilla seeds. Mix on low to combine, then increase to medium and cream until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWith mixer still running, add eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in 1/3 of flour, then add vanilla extract and 1/3 of sour cream. Repeat with remaining flour and sour cream, working in thirds as before.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nScrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula and resume mixing on medium speed for 1 second to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering around 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.)\nScrape into prepared pan and bake until crust is golden (although the interior of the split crown will be quite pale), about 55 minutes or to an internal temperature of 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). Cool cake to about 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C), then loosen with a butter knife and remove from pan. Wrap tightly in plastic and continue cooling until no trace of warmth remains, about 3 hours. Slice with a chef's knife and serve plain, with ice cream, or with fruity whipped cream and fresh fruit.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n, flexible spatula, 8-inch aluminum loaf pan,\ndigital thermometer\nNotes\nProblems such as shrinking, toughness, or dense/wet texture can stem from all-purpose flours that are too strong. Cakes in particular benefit from soft all-purpose flours, especially those made from a blend of red and white wheat, such as bleached Gold Medal or Pillsbury.\nRead More\nSuper Thick and Fruity Food Processor Whipped Cream\nCakes\nBaking\nSour Cream"
