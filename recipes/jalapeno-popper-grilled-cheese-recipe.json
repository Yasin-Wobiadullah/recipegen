Alternatively, place under a preheated broiler as close as possible to the heat source, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer charred jalape\u00f1os to a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap tightly to seal. Let rest 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place bacon in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet and cook over medium-low heat, turning occasionally, until crisp all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and bacon fat to a small bowl.\nUnwrap jalape\u00f1os. Peel skin and discard. Remove stems and seeds. Split each pepper in half lengthwise.\nWipe out skillet and return to medium heat. Melt butter until foaming subsides. Add both bread slices and cook, swirling occasionally, until pale golden brown on bottom side, about 2 minutes.\nTransfer to a cutting board toasted-side-up. Place cheese slice on top of one slice, followed by bacon slices and jalape\u00f1o peppers. Place cheese slice on top of other slice of bread and spread cream cheese over it. Close sandwich.\nAdd half of reserved bacon fat to skillet and heat over medium-low heat. Add sandwich and cook, swirling occasionally, until deep, even golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove sandwich using a flexible metal spatula. Add the remaining bacon fat. Return sandwich to skillet cooked-side up. Season with salt. Cook, swirling occasionally, until second side is deep, even golden brown and cheese is thoroughly melted, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nnonstick\nor\ncast iron skillet\nRead More\nCrispy Deep-Fried Jalape\u00f1o Poppers Recipe\nCrispy and Gooey Baked Jalape\u00f1o Poppers Recipe\nStuffed Jalape\u00f1os Recipe\nBuffalo Chicken Grilled Cheese Recipe\nCemita Grilled Cheese Recipe\nAmerican\nStovetop\nCheese\nBacon\nJalapenos"
