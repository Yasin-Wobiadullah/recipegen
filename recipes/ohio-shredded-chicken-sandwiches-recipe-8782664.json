In a large skillet or Dutch oven, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add chicken and cook until browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.\nReturn all chicken to skillet or Dutch oven and add chicken stock, bring to a simmer, and scrape the bottom of pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Lower heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken registers 175\u00b0F (80\u2103), 5 to 7 minutes. Use tongs to transfer chicken to a cutting board to cool.\nStrain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof measuring cup or medium bowl. Stir in milk; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nIn the now-empty pan, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, black pepper, and salt and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute. Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Cook until toasted and no dry flour remains, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nGradually pour in the reserved stock and milk mixture, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring often, until gravy thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nUsing an immersion blender (or carefully transferring to a standard blender), pur\u00e9e the sauce until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. If using a blender, return sauce to pot.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nUsing 2 forks, shred chicken finely, then return to pot with sauce. Simmer until mixture resembles a thick gravy and a line drawn by a spoon holds its shape for a few seconds, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in reserved banana pepper brine, and let cool for 15 minutes. (It will thicken further as it cools.)\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nFor serving sandwiches:\nFor each sandwich, pile about 1/2 cup shredded chicken mixture onto a bottom bun. Add pickled banana peppers. Top with the remaining bun and serve warm.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet or Dutch oven, fine-mesh strainer, tongs, immersion or standard blender\nNotes\nInstead of using milk, you can substitute with half-and-half or cream for a richer texture and flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe cooked chicken and the sauce can be prepared ahead (through step 7, omitting the banana pepper brine), cooled, and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Reheat in a skillet over low heat until hot, then remove from heat and add the banana pepper brine. Let mixture cool for 15 minutes, and assemble and serve the sandwiches.\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nChicken\nMidwestern"
