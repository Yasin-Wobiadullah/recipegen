Use a slotted spoon to transfer hydrated porcini to a cutting board. Chop porcini and return to stock. Set aside.\nPat steak dry and season steak cubes generously with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stockpot, heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat until melted. Once foaming subsides and butter begins to brown, add steak and sear, stirring occasionally, until cubes are generously browned all over, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large plate and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdd cremini mushrooms to Dutch oven and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms release their liquid and are deeply browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdd remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, then onions, carrots, and celery. Stir until vegetables are softened and browned around edges, about 4 minutes. Add tomato paste and stir to incorporate, about 30 seconds. Add flour and stir until vegetables are coated and no bright white streaks remain, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdd sherry and stir vigorously, scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon, until fragrant and almost completely evaporated, about 30 seconds. Add broth with porcini mushrooms, tomatoes, cooked cremini mushrooms, steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. (Do not add steak.)\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nBring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until soup is glossy and has thickened, about 15 minutes.
