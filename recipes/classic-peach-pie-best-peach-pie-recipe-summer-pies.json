Toss the mixture until the peaches are evenly coated, then pour into the prepared, chilled pie shell.\nCover the fruit with the prepared, chilled top crust, shape as desired. Chill the shaped pie for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\nBrush the top of the chilled pie with egg wash just before baking. Sprinkle with sugar and bake for 15 minutes, rotating the pie halfway through. After 15 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and continue baking for 30 to 40 minutes, rotating again halfway through. Bake until the top is golden brown the the filling is bubbling all over.\nSpecial Equipment\n9-inch pie plate\nNotes\nTo remove peach skins, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and set up a large bowl of cold water and ice next to the stove. Using tongs, add the peaches to the boiling water three or four at a time and allow them to boil for 30-40 seconds, fully submerged. Then, lift the peaches out of the hot water and plunge them into the ice water bath. Allow them to sit completely submerged in the ice water for 1 minute. Once the peaches are cool, the skins will rub right off the peach flesh, and they're ready for baking.\nRead More\nFreeform Peach Pie (Galette)\nClassic Biscuit-Topped Peach Cobbler\nRustic Apricot-Peach Crostata\nPeach Melba\nPies\nBaking\nPeach\nSummer Desserts",
