Whisk in half-and-half until well combined, then bring saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until a custard forms on the back of a spoon and a finger swiped across the back leaves a clean line, or until custard reaches 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C).\nIn the meantime, place sugar cone crumbles in a single layer in a sheet pan and toast in oven until they darken in color and begin to smell toasted, 2 to 3 minutes, keeping an eye on them to ensure they don't burn. Carefully transfer toasted cone crumbles to a blender.\nStrain cooked ice cream base into blender carafe, cover, and let sit for 15 minutes, then blend until cones are completely pur\u00e9ed into base, about 30 seconds. Add vodka and salt to taste. Strain into an airtight container and refrigerate, or into a bowl over an ice bath, and chill until base cools down to 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C).\nChurn base according to manufacturer's instructions. Serve right away as soft serve or transfer ice cream to airtight container and chill in freezer for at least 4 to 5 hours before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\n,\nblender\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nRead More\nThe Complete History of Ice Cream Cones\nWaffle Cone\nSpeculoos-Stroopwafel Ice Cream\nOreo Ice Cream\nGingerbread Ice Cream\nIce Cream\nHeavy Cream",
