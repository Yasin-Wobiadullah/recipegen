Cover and bring to boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.\nWhile rice is cooking, heat oil over high heat in slope-sided pan (if you have a wok, use it; if not, use small saucepan), just enough to coat bottom by 1/2 inch. When oil shimmers, add curd chiles. Toss continually until golden brown, 15-30 seconds. Set aside to drain.\nDiscard all but two tablespoons oil and return to heat. When oil shimmers, add mustard seeds and stir to coat in oil. When seeds begin to pop, add asafoetida, cumin, and curry leaves. Fry until aromatic, about 10 seconds, then remove from heat.\nIf using wok, add cooked rice to spice oil and mix to combine. Otherwise pour and mix spice oil into pot of cooked rice. Stir in yogurt and add salt to taste. Serve in small bowls with pomegranate seeds, cilantro sprigs, and a couple curd chiles to garnish.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Curd Chiles\nRice & Grains\nVegetarian\nYogurt & Cultured Dairy",
