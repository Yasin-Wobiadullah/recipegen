(If you don't have a mortar, place cut-up chilies in a plastic zipper bag, seal bag well and get rid of trapped air, wrap bag with a kitchen towel, then pound on it with a meat tenderizer or something heavy.)\nHeat oil in a 10- or 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, minced garlic, fish sauce, oyster sauce, chicken stock, and sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is almost cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add long beans, crushed chilies, and kaffir lime leaves. Continue to stir-fry until chicken is cooked through and long beans are still crisp and retain their green color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more fish sauce if desired. Transfer to a serving platter and serve with steamed rice.\nThai\nChicken Stir-Fry\nGreen Beans\nChile Pepper"
