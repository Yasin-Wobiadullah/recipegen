Add the mustard seeds and cook until they start to pop. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in green chile, salt, turmeric, red chile powder, and chaat masala. Add boiled potatoes, stirring to incorporate, then remove from heat. Using a potato masher, mash potatoes until no large chunks remain. Set aside to cool.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nIn a medium bowl, whisk chickpea flour, salt, turmeric, chile powder, and cardamom together. Whisk in water until completely smooth, adding more water as needed; the batter should be runny like a custard and not too thick or thin.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nIn a 6-quart Dutch oven or wok, heat oil over medium heat until it reaches 350\u00baF (177\u00baC). Meanwhile, set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet or line the baking sheet with paper towels.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nPlace 4 slices of bread on a cutting board or clean work surface. Using an offset spatula or back of a spoon, spread 1/4 cup of the potato mixture onto each slice of bread. Top each with another slice of bread, pressing to help potatoes adhere to bread.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nUsing a sharp knife, cut each sandwich into 4 quadrants. Working in batches to prevent crowding the oil, dip four triangles in the batter, allowing excess to drain off, then carefully lower sandwiches into the oil. Fry, until golden brown and crisp all over, using tongs to flip halfway through, about 5 minutes. Transfer fried sandwiches to prepared baking sheet and season with salt. Return oil to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC) and repeat with remaining sandwiches. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet, saut\u00e9 pan, or wok, 6-quart Dutch oven, wire rack, rimmed baking sheet, offset spatula\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe potato filling can be made 3 to 4 days in advance and refrigerated.\nIndian\nThe Latest\nRusset Potatoes\nSandwiches",
