Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange plums, cut side up, in a single layer. Roast for 15 minutes, until plums are jammy and offer no resistance to a paring knife. Remove from oven and wrap in aluminum foil to cool for 10 minutes.\nTransfer plums to blender or food processor with ginger and plum brandy. Blend till smooth, then add cream (or cream and half-and-half). Blend again for 30 seconds or until very smooth. Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl or storage container. Stir in salt and 3/4 to 1 cup of honey, to taste.\nChill overnight, then churn the next day according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Serve immediately as soft serve or let firm up in freezer for 2 to 3 hours.\nNotes\nI'm partial to 10-year-old Slivovitz, but you can use any plum brandy (or other brandies for that matter) that you like.\nUsing heavy cream alone produces a very rich and buttery ice cream; a mix of heavy cream and half-and-half is still rich, but not quite as buttery.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n; aluminum foil;\nblender\nor\nfood processor\n;\nice cream maker\nRead More\nThe Real Rules of Making Boozy Ice Cream\nPlum Sorbet Recipe\nRoasted Apricot and Almond Ice Cream Recipe\nBourbon Peach Brown Sugar Ice Cream Recipe\nPlum\nHeavy Cream\nGinger\nIce Cream\nSummer Desserts"
