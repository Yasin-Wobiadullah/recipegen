Place chicken in zipper lock bag and rub marinade into chicken well. Refrigerate 2 hours, turning bag occasionally.\nAdjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Place chicken on rimmed baking sheet skin side up. Roast until skin is deep golden and chicken is cooked through (175\u00b0F or 79\u00b0C), about 20 minutes.\nWhile chicken is roasting, make glaze: In small saucepan, bring orange juice to simmer over medium heat. Reduce orange juice to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes. Stir in remaining teaspoon rosemary, apricot preserves, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook until syrupy and reduced to about 1/3 cup.\nWhen chicken is cooked, brush glaze over chicken. Increase oven heat to broil and cook just until glaze browns, 1 to 2 minutes (see note). Transfer to serving plate and let rest 15 minutes before serving.\nFor the Spinach Salad\n: In medium bowl, whisk vinegar, mustard, and salt. Slowly whisk in oil until combined. Toss spinach with dressing, blue cheese, walnuts, and orange slices. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve chicken and salad immediately.\nNotes\nTake care when broiling chicken. The glaze browns quickly.\nChicken Mains\nRoasted Chicken\nOrange"
