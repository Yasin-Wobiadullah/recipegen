Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Arrange bread in a single layer on the rack and cook in oven, turning once, until dried but not toasted, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and line a separate plate with a double layer of paper towels. Set baking sheet aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, and salt until thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a large Dutch oven or wok, add oil until it measures 2 inches deep and heat over high heat to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC). Meanwhile, lay 4 slices of bread out on a work surface and spread each slice with 2 tablespoons peanut butter , then top each with a slice of bread.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhisk egg mixture to recombine, then, working with 1 sandwich at a time, soak sandwich in egg mixture, flipping as needed, until saturated, about 2 minutes. Allow any excess egg mixture to drip into the bowl, then carefully add soaked sandwich to hot oil and fry until golden brown on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Using tongs and/or spider skimmer, gently flip the sandwich and continue to fry until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer the French toast to the prepared plate, then place on wire rack and keep warm in the oven. Return oil to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC)\u00a0 and repeat with remaining sandwiches.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nDivide the French toast among four plates, top with pats of butter and a generous drizzle of condensed milk. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nWire rack, rimmed baking sheet, large Dutch oven or wok, instant-read thermometer, tongs and/or spider skimmer\nNotes\nWhite sandwich bread may be substituted for milk bread or brioche, but I recommend using a soft, enriched bread for best results.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nHong Kong-style French toast should be eaten immediately.\nFrench Toast\nThe Latest\nBreakfast & Brunch\nBreakfast Sandwich\nSandwiches",
