Slowly add water, whisking constantly, to form a smooth cr\u00eape-like batter. Whisk vigorously for 1 minute to help aerate batter. Let rest 20 minutes.\nRemove skillet from oven and grease with vegetable oil. Add enough batter to skillet, swirling, to cover entire bottom surface in a thin, even layer. Set over high heat and cook until browned and crisp on the bottom, about 3 minutes.\nUsing a thin metal spatula, lift pancake and flip. Cook on other side until browned in spots, about 1 minute. Transfer pancake to a rack or clean paper towel to cool. Wipe skillet clean, grease, and repeat with remaining batter. Try not to stack pancakes once done: You want them to dry, not steam.\nCut pancakes into roughly 2-inch diamond shapes. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, then remove from heat. Add pancake pieces until all are submerged, then drain in a colander right away.\nTransfer pancakes to a large, clean mixing bowl and toss gently with pesto. Spoon testaroli on plates, top with basil leaves and more grated cheese and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nCast iron skillet\nNotes\nIn place of pesto, you can also toss the testaroli with a very simple mixture of extra virgin olive oil, torn basil leaves, and grated pecorino or Parmesan cheese.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Testaroli, the Italian Pancake Pasta\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Pasta",
