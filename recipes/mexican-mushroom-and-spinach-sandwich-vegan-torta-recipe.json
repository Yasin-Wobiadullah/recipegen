Alternatively, broil as close as you can get to broiler element, turning occasionally, until blackened on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover tightly in plastic wrap, and set aside.\nHeat 2 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until well-browned, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spinach along with 2 tablespoons water. Cook, folding and stirring until spinach is completely wilted and water has evaporated, about 3 minutes total. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and press with more paper towels to draw out excess moisture. Set aside.\nCarefully peel charred skin from poblano peppers, remove stems and seeds, and cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch strips.\nIn a small bowl, combine refried beans, chipotle peppers, and molasses. Stir with a fork until homogenous.\nTo assemble sandwiches, split rolls in half. Spread bean mixture evenly over bottom halves. Top with poblano slices, followed by wilted spinach/mushroom mixture, jalape\u00f1o slices, pickled red onions, and cilantro. Spread sliced avocados evenly on cut-side of top half of rolls. Close sandwiches, pressing down gently to compress. Serve as-is, or toast in a panini press or in a hot oven for a few minutes if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nSandwich press (optional)\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Vegan Experience: Two Great Mexican Tortas\nMexican\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nSpinach\nCremini & Button Mushrooms",
