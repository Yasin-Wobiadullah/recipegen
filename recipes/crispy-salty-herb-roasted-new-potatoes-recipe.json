Add salt and stir to dissolve. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a low boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has completely evaporated and potatoes are covered in a film of salt, about 45 minutes. Drain and rinse potatoes of excess salt.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nWhile potatoes simmer, combine garlic, chives, parsley, sage, thyme, and shallot in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse, scraping down sides as necessary, until finely chopped and no large pieces remain. Scatter butter chunks on top. Pulse until homogeneous paste is formed. Season generously with salt and pepper and pulse to combine. Potatoes and herb butter can be made ahead to this stage for up to 5 days before continuing.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil. (If potatoes do not all fit on one rack, use 2 baking sheets, rotating top to bottom halfway through cooking.) Heat herb butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted. Toss potatoes and half of melted herb butter in a large bowl to coat. Transfer to baking sheet and roast, shaking pan occasionally, until crisp all over, about 20 minutes. Re-melt remaining herb butter. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and toss with remaining herb butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper (you probably won't need any extra salt). Serve.\nSerious Eats / J.
