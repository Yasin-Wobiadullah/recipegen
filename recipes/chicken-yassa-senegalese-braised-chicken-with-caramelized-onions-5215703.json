Cover bowl or seal bag, then marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 and up to 12 hours.\nFor the Yassa:\nRemove chicken from the marinade, scraping off any onions and pepper; discard the marinade. Using paper towels, blot chicken dry. In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken, skin-side down, and cook until well browned, about 6 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula, turn chicken and cook on second side until browned, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat and transfer chicken to a platter.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nLower heat to medium, add sliced onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened, about 7 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring and scraping frequently, until onions are dark brown and caramelized, about 15 minutes. Stir in garlic and mustard and cook until fragrant and slightly softened, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nAdd chicken stock, Scotch bonnet pepper, bay leaf, and chicken along with any accumulated juices, nestling chicken pieces into the onions; season lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nReduce heat to medium-low and cook, gently stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and beginning to fall from the bone, about 1 hour. Season with salt, if needed. Serve with rice, couscous, or fonio, and lemon or lime wedges.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe Yassa can be refrigerated for up to 5 days in an airtight container. Reheat gently before serving.\nRead More\nLowcountry Stew Chicken Recipe\nJamaican Brown Stew Chicken Recipe\nChicken Adobo (Filipino-Style Braised Chicken) Recipe\nSenegalese Cuisine\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Mains\nChicken Legs\nThe Latest",
