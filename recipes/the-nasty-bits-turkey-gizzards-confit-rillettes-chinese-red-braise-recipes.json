  "full_text": "Turkey Gizzards Two Ways\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n4 hrs 40 mins\nCooling and Chilling Time\n80 mins\nTotal\n6 hrs 10 mins\nMakes\n4 crocks\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1.5 to 2\npounds\nturkey gizzards\n2\ncelery stalks\n1\nmedium\nonion\n1\ncarrot\n3\nbay leaves\n1/2\nteaspoon\nthyme\n, or herbs of your choice such as oregano, majoram, etc.\n6\nor so black\npeppercorns\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n, or to taste\n1 1/2\nquarts\nchicken stock\nor water\n1/4\ncup\nfat\nRed Braised Turkey Gizzards\n1\npound\nturkey gizzards\n1/4\ncup\nsoy sauce\n3\ntablespoons\nShao Xing rice wine, or\nsake\n3\nlumps\nrock sugar\n, or\n3\ntablespoons\nbrown sugar\n1\n(\n1-inch) piece\nof\nginger\n, scrubbed clean\n2\nstar anise\n1\n(2-inch) piece\nof\ncinnamon\nA few\nchili peppers\n, optional\nDirections\nBring a large pot of water to a boil, and place the gizzards in the boiling water. Let the gizzards cook for one minute to get rid of any impurities. Drain the gizzards and rinse under cold water.\nPlace the gizzards in a medium-sized pot and cover with water. Add the remaining ingredients: the water or stock, the aromatics and herbs, and peppercorns.\nBring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 3 hours or until the gizzards are fork-tender.\nRemove the gizzards from the stock and let cool to slightly above room temperature. Strain the stock and set aside. The majority of the stock can be used in a gravy; reserve some of the liquid for use in the rillettes.\nPlace the gizzards in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed, slowly adding enough of the reserved stock, until the meat shreds thoroughly and the mixture takes on a moist and spreadable texture, about 1 to 3 minutes. Taste and more add salt and pepper. Since the rillettes will be served at room temperature, the paste should be slightly saltier than what you would normally expect from a warm preparation.\nSpoon the mixture into individual ramekins or crocks. Refrigerate until chilled, then pour about 1/8 inch of rendered fat on top to seal the ramekins. If you are running low on fat, use a bit of olive oil to bulk up the mixture. Refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.\nRemove the rillettes from the refrigerator 2 hours before serving; they are best at room temperature. Serve with bread or toast.\nRed Braised Turkey Gizzards:\n(makes enough for an appetizer that serves 6 or more). Place the gizzards in a medium-sized pot and cover with water. Add the remaining ingredients.\nBring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a steady simmer and cook for 1 1/2 hours or until the gizzards are fork-tender. Towards the end of the cooking time, the liquid will have reduced into a syrupy sauce. Take care that the sauce doesn't burn.\nLet the gizzards cool to room temperature. Before serving, slice them thinly on a bias. Serve as a snack or appetizer, accompanied by noodles or rice. Leftover gizzards may be refrigerated, whole, for up to a week. Do not slice until you are ready to serve, as the flavor degrades of a thin-sliced gizzards degrades more quickly.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nFor the rillettes: remove from the refrigerator 2 hours before serving; they are best at room temperature.\nFor the red-braised gizzards: leftover gizzards may be refrigerated, whole, for up to a week. Do not slice until you are ready to serve, as the flavor degrades of a thin-sliced gizzards degrades more quickly.\nTurkey\nBraised & Stewed Turkey"
