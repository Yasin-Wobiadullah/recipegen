Add 3 tablespoons of the salt along with the baking soda, stirring briefly to combine, then cover loosely and let soak at room temperature at least 8 and up to 12 hours. Drain the beans, then rinse well under running tap water.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nBundle up onion and garlic halves, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves in cheesecloth and tie closed with kitchen twine. In a large Dutch oven, add prepared bundle along with drained beans and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Add water to cover beans by 3 inches. Cover and bring to a boil over high. Crack the lid, reduce heat to medium, and gently simmer, stirring occasionally and skimming foam from surface as needed and adjusting heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer, until beans are tender and creamy throughout, about 2 hours. Drain beans.\nFor the Sauce:\nIn a deep 12-inch stainless steel skillet,\u00a0 melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until reduced to a thin, syrup-like consistency, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes and water. Bring to a vigorous simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, the sauce tastes slightly sweet and tangy, and slightly thickens, about 20 minutes.\nAdd sauce and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to a blender. Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening. Blend on high speed until very smooth, about 45 seconds. Pour sauce back into skillet and gently stir in cooked Beans. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are coated in a thick but sauce glaze, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nSpoon bean mixture evenly over toasts and garnish with parsley.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch stainless-steel skillet\n,\nDutch oven\nBritish\nDairy-free Breakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nWhite Beans\nBreakfast & Brunch"
