Season generously with salt. Let rest, stirring twice during the first 10 minutes, while you prepare the other ingredients.\nUse a hand blender or countertop blender to process tomatoes until mostly smooth, but still a little chunky. Set aside 3/4 cup of tomatoes. Combine remaining tomatoes, heavy cream, and chicken stock in a medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and set aside.\nHeat oil and butter in a large straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, swirling, until butter is mostly melted. Add sausage and cook, mashing with a potato masher or a whisk, until sausage is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add onion and garlic, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add oregano, red pepper flakes, and half of parsley and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nAdd tomato and cream mixture to pan with sausage. Drain noodles in a large colander set in the sink, then add to pan and stir to combine. Stir in half of ricotta, then rapidly stir in half of mozzarella cheese. (Do not over-stir, or the mixture will stretch and stick to your spoon.) Spoon reserved 3/4 cup tomatoes over top of pasta. Dollop with remaining ricotta and scatter remaining mozzarella over top. Sprinkle with half of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cover and cook over the lowest possible heat for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes.\nUncover, sprinkle with remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano and parsley, and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nHand blender\nor\ncountertop blender\n,\n5-quart straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan\nor\nDutch oven\nNotes\nLook for ricotta that has no gums or stabilizers and lists only milk, salt, and either an acid or a starter culture on the label. Our favorite nationally available store brand is Calabro.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's No-Boil Baked Ziti\nBaked Ziti With Two Mozzarellas and Parmesan Cream Sauce\nItalian\nStovetop Pasta\nMozzarella\nRicotta\nPastas"
