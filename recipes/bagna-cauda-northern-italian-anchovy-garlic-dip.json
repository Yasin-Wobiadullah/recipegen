(Very developed green germs can add a subtle bitterness to the sauce, though our tests with younger garlic showed no noticeable difference between batches made with and without a more beige germ.) Slice garlic.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a small saucepan, combine garlic and milk or water, bring to a gentle simmer, and cook until garlic is soft, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDrain garlic well. Wipe out saucepan, then return garlic to saucepan and cover with olive oil. Cook over very low heat until garlic is very soft and can easily be smashed with a wooden spoon, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd anchovies and cook, stirring and smashing, until they have fully dissolved into the sauce. Continue smashing the garlic and anchovies until a thick pur\u00e9e forms. (If desired, you can very quickly pur\u00e9e the bagna c\u00e0uda with an immersion blender to make an even smoother sauce.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe hot with raw vegetables and slices of roasted onion (if using).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion blender\n(optional)\nNotes\nMilk and water yield very similar results, with milk adding just a slight extra richness to the final dip. Both work well.\nRead More\nTaste Test: The Best Anchovy Fillets\nEverything You Can Do With a Tin of Anchovies\nDips\nItalian\nAnchovies\nGarlic"
