Stir in onions, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and saffron (if using), and season with salt.\nSeason chicken all over with salt and pepper and nestle into the onions along with the figs and pistachios. Lower heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of tagine or pot occasionally to prevent sticking and scorching, until chicken is cooked through and registers 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour; lower heat at any point if the onions seem to be sticking and browning quickly (a little bit of browning is okay, but you want everything to cook gently).\nTransfer chicken to a serving platter, stir chickpeas into onion mixture, and continue to cook until warmed through. Season onions and chickpeas with salt, if needed. Spoon onion and chickpea mixture along with cooking juices, figs, and pistachios on top of chicken. Garnish with picked herbs and serve with warm rice or couscous. (Alternatively, you can return the chicken pieces to the tagine and serve from there.)\nSpecial equipment\n12-inch tagine or\n5 1/2-quart Dutch oven\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe finished dish can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nNorth African\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChickpeas\nChicken Legs\nFig"
