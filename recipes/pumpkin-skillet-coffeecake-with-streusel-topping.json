Combine by hand (or with a paddle attachment) to smash the butter into the dry ingredients, until everything is coated and clumpy. Add white chocolate and pecans and continue smashing (or mixing) to form a clumpy mix. Cover and refrigerate until needed, or transfer to a zip-top bag and freeze for up to 3 months.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Pumpkin Skillet Batter:\nIn the bowl of a food processor, grind flour, white chocolate, and malted milk powder to form a fine, dry mix with no visible lumps of white chocolate. Alternatively, grate white chocolate with a Microplane, then whisk with flour and malted milk powder to combine. Set aside until needed, or transfer to an airtight container and store at cool room temperature until the date stamped on the bag of flour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine brown sugar, butter, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and vanilla. Mix on low to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until very soft, pale, and fluffy, about 8 minutes. Along the way, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula as needed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhile mixing on medium speed, add egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, and add pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Once smooth, add the malted white chocolate-flour all at once, and continue mixing to form a thick batter. Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then fold once or twice to ensure it's well mixed from the bottom up.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nScrape batter into a lightly greased cast iron skillet (the leftover butter wrappers should do the trick), and spread into an even layer. Scatter prepared streusel topping over the top in an even layer, and bake until the \"cake\" is puffed, golden brown, and approximately 205\u00b0F (96\u00b0FC) in the center, about 35 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCool to room temperature before serving, as the \"cake\" will seem gooey and wet while warm due to the molten cocoa butter in the white chocolate. When cool, cut into wedges with a sharp knife, and serve alongside a strong cup of coffee or tea for brunch or dessert. Individually wrapped in plastic, the portions will keep at room temperature for several days.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nor microplane, stand mixer,\n10-inch cast iron skillet\n,\ndigital thermometer\nNotes\nFor a cakier crumb, reduce the light brown sugar to 9 ounces (about 1 rounded cup, firmly packed; 255g).\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe prepared streusel can be frozen for up to three months. The prepared malted white chocolate flour can be stored at cool room temperature until the date stamped on the malted milk powder.\nAfter serving, individually wrapped slices of coffee cake will keep for several days at room temperature.\nQuick Breads\nPumpkin\nBreakfast & Brunch\nCakes\nFall Breakfast & Brunch",
