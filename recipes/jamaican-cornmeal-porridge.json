Meanwhile, in a 3-quart saucepan or saucier, heat coconut milk, bay leaves, salt, and 3 1/3 cups (790ml) water over high heat until boiling. Whisk in cornmeal mixture with its water, then lower the heat to low to maintain a gentle simmer while avoiding spattering. Continue to cook, whisking frequently to prevent lumps, until cornmeal has thickened and cooked through, about 20 minutes; whisk in additional water as needed at any point if porridge becomes too thick.\nDiscard bay leaves. Whisk in brown sugar, vanilla, and, if desired, as much condensed milk as needed to reach your desired sweetness level. Season with freshly grated nutmeg to taste. If lumps form at any point, simply whisk vigorously to remove. Spoon porridge into bowls, drizzle with condensed milk, if desired, and dust lightly with a final grating of nutmeg. Serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucier\nRead More\nBreakfast Black Rice Porridge With Coconut Cream\nCreamy Irish-Style Oatmeal With Brown Sugar\nBananas Foster Oatmeal With Walnuts and Peanut Butter\nCuccia (Sicilian Wheatberry and Ricotta Porridge)\nKorean Red Bean Porridge\nJamaican\nCaribbean\nStovetop\nCornmeal\nBreakfast & Brunch"
