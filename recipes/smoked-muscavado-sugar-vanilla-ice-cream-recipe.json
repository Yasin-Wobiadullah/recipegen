Nest a smaller shallow disposable aluminum baking pan with at least 2-quart capacity into the ice bath. Set pans in smoker and add 1 quart of cream to smaller pan.\nClose smoker, adjusting vents to maintain as low a temperature as possible, and smoke until cream develops a strong, but not overpowering, smoky flavor, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours; replenishing wood chips 1/2 cup at a time as needed, and stirring cream occasionally. Monitor temperature of cream: If an instant-read thermometer registers above 60\u00b0F, discard ice bath and replace with a fresh one. Pour cream into an airtight container and refrigerate.\nFor the Ice Cream:\nBlend smoked cream with fresh cream to taste, starting with 1/2 cup smoked cream and 1/2 cup fresh cream and adding more of each to taste, until volume totals 2 cups and smoky flavor is pleasant and not overpowering. Reserve additional smoked and fresh creams for another use.\nWhisk together egg yolks and muscovado sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Whisk in diluted smoked cream and milk until fully combined, then place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid reaches 170\u00b0F or until a finger swiped across the back of the spoon leaves a clean line.\nPour custard through a fine mesh strainer into an airtight container, stir in vanilla and salt, and chill in an ice bath or refrigerator until it registers no more than 45\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer ice cream to airtight container and chill in freezer for at least 4 to 5 hours before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nIce cream machine, smoker, disposable aluminum baking pans (one with at least a 2-quart capacity, the other larger)\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Best Sweet Use for Your Smoker?
