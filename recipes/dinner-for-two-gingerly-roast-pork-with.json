Season the pork with salt and pepper, and roll in the fresh thyme so it\u2019s seasoned all over. Rub the ginger preserves all over the meat. Lightly grease a ceramic baking dish with olive oil, and place the pork in the dish. If any ginger preserves have fallen off the meat, pile them up on top of the pork, and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Toss the zucchini with a light drizzle of olive and a pinch of salt, and scatter around the baking dish.\nBake until the center of the pork reaches 140 degrees F, about 15 to 18 minutes. Turn on the broiler (leave the meat where it is), and broil until the preserves on top of the pork caramelize, a minute or two. The pork should now be 145 degrees in its center. Take the dish out of the oven, tent with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice the pork, spoon some of the ginger juice from the pan over the top, and serve with the roasted zucchini and some lightly dressed salad and bread.\nPork Mains\nRoasted Pork\nPork Loin\nThyme"
