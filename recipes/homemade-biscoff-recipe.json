In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine candi or toasted sugar with butter, baking soda, cinnamon, kinako, nutmeg, salt, cloves, cardamom, and anise. Cream on medium speed until fluffy, soft, and pale, about 10 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and paddle as needed if the sugar seems dense and compacted at the bottom of the bowl.\nVicky Wasik\nWhile creaming on medium speed, slowly splash in the water a little at a time. Once it disappears into the fluffy butter/sugar mix, reduce speed to low and add the flour all at once. Continue mixing until the dough begins to gather around the paddle.\nTurn the dough onto a clean surface, and knead gently to form a ball. Pat into a rectangular shape, then dust with flour, above and below. Roll to a thickness of 3/16-inch, using a ruler for guidance. Slide an offset spatula beneath the dough to loosen, and brush away the excess flour.\nWith a fluted pastry wheel, cut the dough into 3/4-inch strips, then cut crossways to form 2-inch rectangles. With the offset spatula, transfer the cutouts and scraps to a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving an inch between each piece to account for spread.\nBake until cookies are golden brown, about 16 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through if needed to ensure even browning. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet; the cookies will not crisp until fully cool. Enjoy with coffee, and store leftovers in an airtight container up to 1 month at room temperature; the scraps can be ground to use for crumbs and frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nrolling pin\n, pastry brush,\noffset spatula\n, two\nhalf sheet pans\nNotes\nLike many copycat desserts, these cookies hinge on a number of key ingredients; if you don't have them on hand, it's better to save this recipe for another time. With each substitution, the incredible flavor and texture of these speculoos-style cookies will be lost.\nRead More\nSpeculoos (Biscoff Cookie Butter)\nSpiced Biscoff Sandwich Cookies\nChocolate Biscoff Truffles\nSpeculoos-Stroopwafel Ice Cream\nCookies\nChristmas Cookies\nBelgian\nPastries"
