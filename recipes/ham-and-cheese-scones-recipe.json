Sift flour into a medium bowl, then whisk in baking powder, sugar, and salt. Add butter and toss to break up the pieces, then smash each one flat between your fingertips. Continue smashing and rubbing until butter disappears into a coarse meal.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd diced ham, scallion, and only 1 ounce cheese (shy 1/4 cup; 30g); the rest will be used to top the scones. Toss until well combined, then stir in milk and cream to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a 7-inch round, no less than 1 inch thick.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCut into 6 wedges with a chef\u2019s knife, cover with remaining cheese, and arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes. Let cool at least 5 minutes. Serve as a snack, with eggy brunch dishes, or alongside hearty soups and stews. Leftovers can be stored up to 24 hours in an airtight container, then briefly warmed in a 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) oven to serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nHalf sheet pan\nNotes\nThis recipe works well with almost any sort of firm, shreddable cheese, so feel free to use whatever you have on hand, from Swiss to parm.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nAfter cutting the butter into the flour, you can actually pause the recipe and refrigerate everything in an airtight container up until the date stamped on your package of butter. When you're ready to bake the scones, just dump the mix into a bowl, add the remaining ingredients and continue with the recipe.\nBaked scones can be stored up to 24 hours in an airtight container, then briefly warmed in a 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) oven to serve.\nQuick Breads\nCheddar Cheese\nGruyere\nHam\nQuick Breakfast"
