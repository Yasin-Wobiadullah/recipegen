Distribute chili flakes, fennel seed, and peppercorns equally into both jars.\nAdd the goat cheese pieces one at a time, adding a little olive oil between each one so they are fully immersed. Add lemon zest, bay leaves, thyme and garlic to jars. Pour in enough olive oil to fully cover cheese. Seal jars and refrigerate for at least a few hours (we found it tasted best after 2 days). The marinated goat cheese can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week, but not any longer than that (see 'Notes' below.)\nSpecial Equipment\n2 half-pint mason jars\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe marinated goat cheese can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week, but not any longer than that (infused olive oil can run the risk of botulism if kept for longer than 1 week, even if refrigerated).\nGoat Cheese\nOlive Oil"
