Microwave on high power until eggplant has lost most of its moisture and appears slightly shriveled, about 8 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally, until eggplant is starting to break down, about 5 minutes longer. Add tomato paste, capers, raisins, sugar, vinegar, and chopped tomatoes and stir to combine. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced into a thick, stew-like consistency, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add broccoli rabe and cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain in a colander and transfer to a large bowl. Add eggplant mixture and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more vinegar or sugar as desired. Serve.\nNotes\nSweet and sour eggplant relish can be made ahead and stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nItalian\nDairy-free Sides\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop Vegetables",
