Add egg mixture and cook, stirring frequently with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, making sure to scrape bottom and sides of skillet, until eggs begin to thicken and form small curds, 6 to 8 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring vigorously to break up large curds, until eggs are thick enough to hold their shape, 3 to 5 minutes longer.\nAdd 'nduja and stir vigorously until incorporated and emulsified, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and season with pepper. Divide scrambled eggs between individual serving plates, sprinkle with chives (if using), and serve right away with toasted bread.\nSpecial equipment\nNonstick skillet\nNotes\nMilk will make for richer, moister scrambled eggs but is not required.\n'Nduja is a spicy spreadable pork\nsalume\nthat originates from the southern Italian region of Calabria. In the US, it can be purchased at specialty shops that carry salumi/charcuterie, Italian markets, or online from producers like\nTempesta Artisan Salumi\n. Look for 'nduja made with just four ingredients: pork, Calabrian chilies, salt, and lactic acid.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nAs anyone who has ever eaten at a breakfast buffet knows, scrambled eggs don't hold well, and are best enjoyed immediately.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nA Guide to\n'Nduja\n: Italy's Funky, Spicy, Spreadable\nSalume\nScrambled Eggs\nStovetop Eggs\nPork\nSausages\nQuick Breakfast"
