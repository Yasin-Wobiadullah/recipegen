Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a casserole dish that just fits it, about 1 1/2 quarts.\nBrush the sides of the dish with milk, and drape the pastry tightly across, pressing gently into the milked sides (this will help the pastry stick). Cut a slit for the steam to escape in the center of the pastry, and then brush all the pastry lightly with milk. Place the pie on a rimmed baking dish to catch any spills, and bake until the pastry is puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor with slicing disc, 1 1/2 quart casserole dish\nTurkey\nSavory\nTurkey Mains\nQuick Dinners"
