Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and allow ingredients to steep until the Ancho chiles have softened, about 5 minutes more. Drain the plums and chiles and set aside to cool.\nPreheat the oven to 500\u00b0F.\nUsing a sharp knife, slice off the stems from the Ancho chiles, then cut a slit down the side of each chile. Open the chiles like a book, then scrape out and discard any seeds. Cut the chilies into 12 strips about 1/2-inch wide.\nWrap each prune in a strip of chile, then in a strip of bacon, and then arrange on a foil-lined baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the oven until the bacon becomes crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with the chopped pumpkin seeds. Season to taste with the black pepper. Serve warm\nHors D'Oeuvres\nPumpkin Seeds\nBacon\nChile Pepper\nQuick Snacks"
