  "full_text": "Scooped: Roasted Beet and Dark Chocolate Ice Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nActive\n45 mins\nChilling and Churning Time\n8 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n9 hrs 15 mins\nMakes\n5 1/2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2/3\npound\nroasted\n,\npeeled beets\n, diced into 1/2 inch cubes (about\n3\nmedium\n)\n3\ncups\nhalf and half\n(or\n1 1/2\ncups\neach\ncream\nand\nwhole milk\n)\n6\negg yolks\n3/4\ncup\nsugar\n3\ntablespoons\n(or to taste: see note)\nhigh-quality Dutch-process cocoa powder\n1/2\nteaspoon\nKosher salt\n1/2\nteaspoon\norange zest\n2\nounces\ndark chocolate\n, shaved on a vegetable peeler\nDirections\nIn a three quart saucepan, combine beets and half and half. Simmer on low heat until a paring knife twisted into a beet easily cuts it apart, about half an hour. While pot is simmering, whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl until light in color and thickened.\nTransfer beet mixture to a blender and pur\u00e9e until very smooth. If your blender lid comes with a stopper for a hole in the lid, remove the stopper and cover with a few sheets of paper towel while blending\u2014this will keep the hot liquid from bursting out while blending.\nReturn beet mixture to saucepan over low heat and thoroughly whisk in cocoa and a pinch of salt. Slowly pour 1/3 of beet mixture into egg mixture, whisking constantly, then transfer everything back to saucepan. Heat below a simmer, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens enough such that a finger swiped across the back of a coated spoon leaves a clean line. Pour through a strainer into an airtight container, add orange zest, stir to combine, and let chill over night.\nThe next day, churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. In the last minute of churning, slowly add shaved chocolate. Ice cream is best eaten as soft-serve. If storing for later, let thaw on a counter for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nice cream maker, blender\nIce Cream\nChocolate\nBeets",
