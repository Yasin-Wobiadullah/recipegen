Remove from heat and set aside to steep, covered, for 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Peel beets and, using a mandoline, slice into 1/8-inch thick slices. Place sliced the beets in a bowl and toss with cornstarch. Layer the beets in an oven-safe 10-inch skillet, pie pan, or 9- by 9-inch baking dish.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBring the milk and cream mixture back to a boil, then strain, discarding solids. Pour cream over beets. Cover with aluminum foil, prick the foil all over with a knife, and bake until beets are tender, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Topping:\nIn a medium bowl, stir together pistachios, panko, melted butter, sugar, and salt. Sprinkle evenly all over gratin, then bake uncovered until golden brown, about 30 minutes longer. Let the gratin rest 20 minutes before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nMorita chiles are a fruity and floral variety of chipotle peppers. If you cannot find them, substitute 1/4 teaspoon each cayenne pepper and smoked paprika or 1/2 teaspoon of the adobo from canned chipotles. If you do use canned chipotles, skip the steep step and stir the adobo into the hot milk and cream mixture just before pouring over the beets to prevent the milk from curdling.\nSpecial Equipment\nMandoline slicer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nRead More\nRoasted Beets With Balsamic Glaze\nCauliflower Gratin\nCrispy Creamy Fennel Gratin\nOver-the-Top Creamed Brussels Sprout Gratin\nBeets\nVegetarian Sides\nSavory\nPistachios\nFall Sides"
