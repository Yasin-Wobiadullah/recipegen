In a medium bowl or shallow baking dish, whisk together corn flour and Creole seasoning. In a second medium bowl or shallow baking dish, whisk cold eggs. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\nMeanwhile, working in batches of six or so oysters, transfer cold, drained oysters to egg mixture and turn to thoroughly coat. Allow excess batter to drip back into bowl. Place oysters in corn flour mixture and toss gently to fully coat.\nCarefully add the oysters to the oil and cook, stirring occasionally with a spider skimmer, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cooked oysters to prepared wire rack and immediately season lightly with salt. Repeat dredging and frying with remaining oysters.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor Serving:\nOpen bread or rolls, and spread cut sides with mayonnaise and/or your condiments of choice. Divide the remaining ingredients evenly among the bread or rolls, placing tomatoes and pickles (if using) against top of roll, followed by lettuce. Pile a generous helping of oysters on the bottom half. Smush together, serve immediately, and enjoy.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the R\u00e9moulade, If Making:\nIn a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, minced pickles, horseradish, hot sauce, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and garlic until thoroughly combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nWire rack\n,\nLarge Dutch oven\n,\nInstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nBob\u2019s Red Mill is one good brand of corn flour. Or, in a pinch, you can also use masa harina.\nShucking oysters is an awful lot of work for po\u2019 boys, in my opinion. For ease, my recommendation is to buy a couple dozen pre-shucked oysters if at all possible.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nR\u00e9moulade can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Po' boys are best enjoyed right away.\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nSoul Food & Southern\nFried Seafood\nOysters"
