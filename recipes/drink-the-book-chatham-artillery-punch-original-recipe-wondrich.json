Set aside for at least half an hour, preferably an hour, to let the flavors combine.\nWhile the lemon peel is resting, juice the lemons to make two cups lemon juice. After the lemon peel has rested, add lemon juice to the bowl and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Strain the mixture into an empty 750mL bottle.\nAdd water to the bottle to fill, seal it, give it a little shake and refrigerate this shrub until you're ready to make your punch.\nTo serve, fill your large (2.5 gallon) punch bowl with cracked ice. (At this point, move your punch bowl to its party-time location, as it will be very difficult to move when it's full of punch.)\nPour the shrub and all of the bottles of cognac, bourbon, rum and sparkling wine onto the ice. Stir to combine. Serve.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge (2.5 gallon) punch bowl, empty 750 milliliter bottle\nWhiskey\nLemon\nBrandy & Cognac\nChampagne\nRum"
