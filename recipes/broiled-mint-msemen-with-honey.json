With mixer running at low speed, slowly drizzle in water. Add egg and mix until thoroughly combined. Increase speed to medium and continue to knead dough until a very slightly sticky and tender dough forms, about 2 minutes.\nTransfer dough to greased mixing bowl. Lightly rub dough all over with oil. Cover with plastic and let rest in a warm place until dough increases in size by about 50 percent, about 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine butter and oil and heat over medium heat until butter is melted. Set aside to cool to room temperature.\nTransfer dough to lightly oiled work surface. Punch down dough. Coat your hands with butter/oil mixture. Divide dough into 8 equal portions and coat lightly with butter/oil mixture. Arrange dough balls on rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic and let rest until dough balls have increased in size by about 50 percent, about 1 hour.\nWorking one at a time on lightly oiled work surface, and using greased hands, flatten each dough ball, pushing outwards from center to make an 8- by 8-inch square; dough square should have a roughly even thickness throughout. Generously brush surface of dough with butter/oil mixture, dust all over with large pinch of semolina, and sprinkle mint leaves on top of dough.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFold dough in thirds, like a letter. Brush top with more butter/oil, dust with more semolina, and season with pinch of flaky salt. Fold into thirds once more to make square packet. Return dough packets to baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic and let rest at least 15 minutes and up to 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, Make the Honey-Butter: In small saucepan, combine honey, butter, and water and cook over medium heat until butter is melted and sauce is smooth, stirring to combine. Season with salt and set aside to cool.\nTo Finish:\nPreheat broiler and set oven rack to 6 inches from broiler element. Working one dough packet at a time, set dough packet on second rimmed baking sheet. Coat hands once more in butter/oil mixture, and, using your fingers, press and stretch dough packet out to a roughly 6- by 6-inch square.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBroil dough packet until browned in spots, turning once halfway through, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a platter and cover with kitchen towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough packets (be sure to let baking sheet cool to a safe level between uses). Serve with honey butter.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nrimmed baking sheets\n, small saucepan\nRead More\nParatha (Flaky South Asian Flatbread)\nLahmajun (Armenian Flatbread with Spiced Lamb)\nLavash (Armenian Flatbread)\nGrilled Naan\nSides\nMoroccan\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nYeast Breads\nBreakfast & Brunch",
