When oven is ready, line chilled pie shell with foil or parchment paper and fill with weights (I reuse dried beans for this), and bake on lowest rack of oven for 15 minutes. Remove weights and liner, turn pie, and bake until bottom crust is a light golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Remove pie shell from oven and allow to cool completely.\nIn a large saucepan, stir together milk, vanilla, half of sugar, and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together egg and egg yolks. Add starch and remaining sugar and whisk until very pale yellow in color, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Place saucepan with milk mixture over low heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. When it starts to bubble, remove from heat. Temper eggs with the hot liquid in small amounts, whisking constantly with each addition. Once all of the liquid has been poured into eggs, pour the mixture back into pot and whisk constantly over low heat until mixture begins to thicken and bubble. From the point you see the first bubble, whisk for 2 additional minutes, then pour the custard into pie shell and press plastic wrap against the top. Allow custard to cool at room temperature, then chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours.\nWhen you are ready to serve, place chopped chocolate in a bowl. In a medium saucepan, combine cream and corn syrup and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once cream begins to simmer, pour cream over chocolate and allow to sit for 2 minutes. Stir mixture until chocolate is smooth. Pour the chocolate glaze over the top of the chilled pie and smooth with an offset spatula, and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\n9-inch pie plate\nPies\nBaking\nChocolate",
