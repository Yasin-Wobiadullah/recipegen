Add bread crumbs and cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until toasted. Season with salt.\nOn a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle asparagus with oil and toss to coat. Season with salt. Broil asparagus, shaking and rotating pan occasionally to cook them evenly on all sides, until asparagus is blistered, about 6 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a small nonstick or cast iron skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add egg and cook until whites are set and have a thin crispy ring around their edge, and the yolk is still runny. Season with salt.\nArrange asparagus on a plate in a single, even layer. Drizzle with fresh olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Break gorgonzola into small chunks and scatter them all over the asparagus. Scatter some seasoned bread crumbs all over, then top with some grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Slide the egg on top, then drizzle with more oil and top with more bread crumbs and grated cheese. Finish with freshly ground black pepper, then serve.\nSpecial equipment\nNonstick or\ncast iron\nskillet\nNotes\nThis recipe makes more bread crumbs than you'll need for the dish. Save the rest to put on fresh pasta, in salads, and other dishes.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThree Variations on Asparagus alla Milanese\nAsparagus\nFried Eggs\nSummer\nSpring"
