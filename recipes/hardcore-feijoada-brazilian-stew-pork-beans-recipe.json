Add the beans and allow to soak overnight (at least 8 hours). Drain and rinse.\nCombine soaked beans, pork parts, sausage, beef, onion, pepper, scallion, cilantro, tomato, and bay leaves in a large saucepot. Cover with water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook, topping up with water as necessary to keep beans completely submerged until beans are completely tender and liquid is a deep black, about 6 to 8 hours. Season to taste with salt (you probably won't need any more, depending on how salty your pig parts were). Serve with rice, orange wedges, greens, hot sauce, and farofa. Feijoada is excellent reheated.\nNotes\nFor best results, use as many different salted pork parts as available, though you can always make it with just a few. Straight up salt pork and slab bacon with some good sausage will be quite delicious.\nFarofa is fried manioc (yucca) flour. It can be found in Brazilian markets ready-to-eat, or make it yourself by toasted rough-ground yucca flour in a bit of oil in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown.\nRead More\nColombian-Style Beans and Rice Recipe\nTraditional French Cassoulet Recipe\nNew Orleans\u2013Style Red Beans and Rice Recipe\nHow to Cook Dried Beans\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Beans\nPork Mains\nBrazilian\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nBlack Beans\nPork"
