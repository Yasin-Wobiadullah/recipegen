Add the flour mixture and mix on the lowest speed until just combined.\nTransfer the dough to a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll into a log about 1 1\u20442\u201d thick. Wrap well and freeze for 30 minutes or refrigerate for at least an hour. If you want to cut the dough into shapes, form the dough into a disk, wrap well, and refrigerate for at least one hour.\nHeat your oven to 325\u00b0F and line two baking sheets with parchment or Silpats.\nForm the cookies:\nIf you\u2019ve rolled the dough into a log, use a sharp knife to cut it into slices about 3/8\u201d thick, the most important thing being that all the slices are of even thickness. If you\u2019re cutting out the cookies, lightly flour your work surface and roll it out about 3/8\u201d thick and cut out shapes using a cookie cutter. Gently re-roll the scraps and repeat.\nBake until the edges are barely golden, about 15 minutes. Cool the cookies on the sheet completely, then transfer to an airtight container. The cookies last about two weeks at room temperature but will keep longer if you refrigerate or freeze them.\nCookies\nBaking"
