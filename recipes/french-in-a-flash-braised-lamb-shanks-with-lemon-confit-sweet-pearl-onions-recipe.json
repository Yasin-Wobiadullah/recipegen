Drain out the olive oil.\nAdd 1 tablespoon olive oil to the same pan, over low heat. Add the garlic and preserved lemon. Saut\u00e9 for 1 minute, careful that the hot pan doesn't burn the garlic. Add the wine and the stock and rosemary and then place the meat back into the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 2 hours, rotating the meat occasionally.\nMeanwhile, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Toss the pearl onions with 2 teaspoons olive oil, and some salt and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nAfter 2 hours have passed, uncover the pot of lamb. Add in the onions, and simmer uncovered for about 5 minutes, just to thicken the sauce slightly. It will already be gravy-like in consistency. Serve with couscous or baguette or warm simple white beans."
