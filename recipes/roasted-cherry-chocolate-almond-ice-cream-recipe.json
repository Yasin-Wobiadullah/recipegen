Toss cherries in 13- by 9-inch ceramic or glass baking dish with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Roast until juices stack in high bubbles and cherries offer no resistance to a paring knife, 30 to 40 minutes. Set aside to cool.\nWhen cherries are cool enough to handle, cut in half to remove pits. Transfer to blender and scrape in cherry juices. Add half and half, egg yolks, and sugar, and blend on high until very smooth.\nPour mixture through a stainer into a medium saucepan and place on medium-low heat. Cook, whisking frequently, until lightly thickened. Custard should coat back of a wooden spoon and a finger swiped through coating should leave a clean line, about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt to taste. Strain into an airtight container and chill over night.\nThe next day, churn ice cream according to manufacturer's instructions. In the last minute of churning, add chopped chocolate and almonds. Transfer to an airtight container and chill in freezer for at least three hours before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nglass baking dish, ice cream maker, blender\nIce Cream\nRoasting\nCherry"
