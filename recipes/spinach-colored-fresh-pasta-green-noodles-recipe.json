  "full_text": "Spinach-Colored Fresh Pasta Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n35 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n40 mins\nResting Time\n30 mins\nTotal\n75 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the Spinach Pur\u00e9e:\n1\nbunch\nfresh spinach\n(approximately\n10\nounces\n), rinsed and stems trimmed\nFor the Dough:\n10\nounces\nall-purpose flour\n5\nyolks\nfrom\n5\nlarge\neggs\n1\nwhole\u00a0large\negg\n4\ntablespoons\nspinach\npur\u00e9e\n1\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\n, plus more for salting water\nDirections\nFor the Spinach\nPur\u00e9e:\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water and ice. Add rinsed and trimmed spinach and cook 15-30 seconds. Drain and plunge spinach into bowl of water. When spinach is cold, drain and spin in salad spinner. Using a hand blender or food processor pur\u00e9e the spinach until smooth.\nFor the Dough:\nOn a large, clean work surface, pour flour in a mound. Make a well in the center about 4 inches wide. Pour whole egg, egg yolks, spinach pur\u00e9e, and salt into well and, using a fork, beat thoroughly. When combined, gradually incorporate flour into the eggs until a wet, sticky dough has formed.\nUsing a bench knife, scrape excess dough from fork and fingers. Begin to fold additional flour into the dough with bench knife, turning dough roughly 45\u00b0 each time until dough feels firm and dry and can form a craggy-looking ball, 2 to 5 minutes.\nPress the heel of your hand into the ball of dough, pushing forward and down. Rotate the ball 45\u00b0 and repeat. Continue until dough develops a smooth, elastic texture similar to a firm ball of Play-Doh. If dough feels too wet, add flour in 1 teaspoon increments. If dough feels too dry, add water slowly using a spray bottle.\nWrap ball of dough tightly in plastic wrap and rest on countertop for 30 minutes.\nTo Roll the Pasta:\nMeanwhile, place a sheet of parchment paper on a tray or cutting board and dust lightly with flour. Unwrap rested dough and cut into quarters. Set one quarter on work surface and re-wrap remaining dough. With a rolling pin, flatten the quarter of dough into an oblong shape about 1/2 inch thick.\nSet pasta maker to widest setting and pass dough 3 times through the machine at this setting.\nPlace dough on a lightly floured work surface. Fold both ends in so that they meet at the center of the dough, and then fold the dough in half where the endpoints meet, trying not to incorporate too much air into the folds. Using rolling pin, flatten dough to 1/2-inch thick. Pass through the rollers 3 additional times.\nNarrow the setting by 1 notch and repeat Step 8. Repeat once more (the dough should now have passed through the third widest setting). Continue passing the dough through the rollers, reducing the thickness by 1 setting each time until it reaches the desired thickness. It should now be very delicate and elastic to the touch, and slightly translucent.\nPlace rolled dough onto a work surface or baking sheet lightly dusted with flour or lined with parchment paper, folding the dough over as necessary so that it fits; sprinkle with flour or line with parchment between folds to prevent sticking.\nCover dough with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel to prevent drying, then repeat Steps 6 through 10 with remaining dough quarters. If making noodles, cut dough into 12- to 14-inch segments.\nTo Cut Noodles:\nAdjust pasta machine to noodle setting of your choice. Working one dough segment at a time, feed dough through the pasta cutter. Alternatively, cut folded dough by hand with a chef's knife to desired noodle width.\nDivide the cut noodles into individual portions, dust lightly with flour, and curl into a nest. Place on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and gently cover with kitchen towel until ready to cook. Pasta can be frozen directly on the baking sheet, transferred to a zipper-lock freezer bag, and stored in the freezer for up to three weeks before cooking. Cook frozen pasta directly from the freezer.\nTo Cook:\nBring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add pasta, stir gently with a wooden spoon, chopsticks, or a cooking fork, and cook, tasting at regular intervals until noodles are just set with a definite bite, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Drain, toss with sauce, and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nClick for the\nbest tools for making, cooking, and serving pasta\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Color Fresh Pasta\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nSpinach"
