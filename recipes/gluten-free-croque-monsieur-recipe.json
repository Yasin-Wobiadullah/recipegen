Place the bread on an 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Bake, flipping once, until the slices begin to turn golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside. Leave the oven on.\nPrepare the sauce:\nIn a small pot, melt the butter. Add the sweet rice flour. Cook for 3 minutes, whisking constantly. The paste will turn a light golden brown. In a slow and steady steam, add the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce begins to bubble. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in 1/4 cup of the Gruy\u00e8re and all of the parmesan. Whisk until smooth.\nMake the sandwiches on the baking sheet. Spread a thin coat of mustard on each piece of bread. Place a few slices of ham and a generous sprinkle of Gruy\u00e8re on each of 4 bread slices. (Reserve about one-quarter of the cheese.) Top with a second slice of bread, mustard side down. Spoon a generous amount of white sauce onto each sandwich. Divide the remaining Gruy\u00e8re over the top.\nReturn the sandwiches to the oven. Bake for 5 minutes to heat.\nTurn on the broiler. Broil until the cheese is melted, light brown, and bubbling. Serve immediately.\nFrench\nGluten-free Breakfast & Brunch\nGluten-free Mains\nGruyere\nHam",
