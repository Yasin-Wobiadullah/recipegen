In a minimum 3-quart saucepan or Dutch oven, heat corn syrup and sugar over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until mixture is just bubbling around the edges, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats/ Jatin Sharma\nSlowly whisk in peanut butter, vanilla, and kosher salt until peanut butter is completely incorporated and mixture is smooth, about 30 more seconds.\nSerious Eats/ Jatin Sharma\nOff heat, fold in rice cereal with a rubber spatula. Transfer mixture to the greased pan and pat gently into place (do not overpack).\nSerious Eats/ Jatin Sharma\nIn a heatproof bowl, melt chocolate and butterscotch chips in microwave in 15-30 second intervals, stirring thoroughly between each interval, until glossy and smooth. Pour over cereal and use rubber spatula to spread topping across the bars in a thin, even layer. Sprinkle flaky salt over topping, if desired.\nSerious Eats/ Jatin Sharma\nLet scotcheroos rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours or until topping is firm and set. Cut into roughly 2-inch squares and serve.\nSerious Eats/ Jatin Sharma\nSpecial Equipment\n3-qt saucepan or Dutch oven, 9-by-13-inch baking pan, rubber spatula\nNotes\nTo further enhance the bars' molasses notes, you can substitute up to 1/4 cup of the light corn syrup for dark corn syrup or cane syrup. The flavor profile will be less traditional, but absolutely delicious.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStored in an airtight container, uncut scotcheroos can be kept for up to 7 days at room temperature. To keep bars soft, tightly wrap any cut bars individually in plastic wrap.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nAmerican\nDesserts\nMidwestern"
