Press with back of form to mash lightly.\nCarefully peel poblanos under cold running water (or if you can, peel them without rinsing them). Discard stem an seeds and slice flesh into thin strips.\nSmash each plantain under a metal can to about 1/4-inch thick. Reheat oil to 400\u00b0F. Add plantains (working in batches if necessary). Adjust heat to maintain a temperature of 350\u00b0F to 375\u00b0F. Fry, agitating occasionally, until plantains are golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with kosher salt.\nTo serve, spread each plantain with some bean mixture, a slice of avocado, a few strips of pepper, some pickled red onions (along with a jalape\u00f1o or serrano slice from the pickles), and a sprinkle of cilantro.\nSpecial equipment\nWok\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Vegan Experience Days 20 and 21: The Vegan Super Bowl Snack Challenge\nHors D'Oeuvres\nBlack Beans\nPlantains\nGreen Chiles"
