Using a meat pounder, flatten slices to an even 1/4-inch thickness. If using pre-sliced beef, pound lightly just to tenderize.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nPlace steaks in a large shallow baking dish or glass storage container. Sprinkle one side of the steaks evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and half of the garlic. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon lime juice and rub seasonings into the meat. Flip the steaks and repeat with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, remaining garlic, and 1 tablespoon lime juice, making sure meat is evenly coated.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nCover dish tightly with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours before cooking.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nIn a large stainless-steel skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over high heat until just smoking. Working in batches to prevent crowding the pan, add the steaks and cook until browned on each side, 45 to 60 seconds per side. If needed, add an additional 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet between batches. Transfer cooked steaks to a platter and cover with foil or place in a low oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining steaks.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nIn the now-empty skillet, add remaining 1 teaspoon oil and heat over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add the onion, remaining 1 teaspoon lime juice, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon water, and cook, lowering heat as needed to avoid scorching, until the onions begin to soften and brown, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nArrange steaks on serving plates and top with browned onions. Serve immediately, preferably with Cuban black beans and rice.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nSpecial Equipment\nMeat pounder, large stainless-steel skillet\nNotes\nIf you do not have a meat pounder, you can use a blunt object such as a rolling pin, heavy bottomed skillet, or pestle to pound the meat into 1/4-inch slices.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBeef Mains\nThe Latest\nSteaks\nCuban",
