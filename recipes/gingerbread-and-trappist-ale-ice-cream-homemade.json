Heat over medium-low heat until just below simmering, stirring often, about 15 minutes.\nIn a bowl, whisk together the yolks and brown sugar until thoroughly combined. Add one ladle of the cream mixture to the yolks while whisking constantly. Repeat once or twice until the yolks are warmed, then return everything to the pot. Readjust the heat source so liquid remains at just below a simmer.\nCook, stirring frequently until thickened (custard should coat back of spoon), 5 to 7 minutes. Add the chocolate, lemon zest, and the last 1/3 cup of ale. To test for doneness, stick in a spoon, then run your finger along the back. If the custard coats the spoon in a thick layer and leaves a clear line, the custard is ready.\nStrain the custard into a heat-proof bowl and stir in the vanilla. Chill in refrigerator overnight. Churn the next day according to ice cream maker manufacturer's instructions. During last minute of churning, add the candied ginger.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nIce Cream\nChocolate\nGinger"
