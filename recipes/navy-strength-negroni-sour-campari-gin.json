Use immediately or refrigerate up to 5 days.\nFor Each Cocktail:\nAdd measured batched Negroni, lemon, egg white, simple syrup, and orange flower water (if using) to a cocktail shaker and fill with ice. Shake hard to emulsify and foam egg, about 40 times. Double-strain into a Martini glass or coupe. Twist orange zest over top to express oils and discard. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nCocktail shaker and strainer, fine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nThe batched Negroni recipe yields enough for three drinks. The individual cocktail recipe easily doubles or triples, but do not shake more than two drinks at a time. To make rich simple syrup, combine 1/2 cup water with 1 cup sugar in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Cool before using. Simple syrup will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to five days.\nGin\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines\nMother's Day\nValentine's Day"
