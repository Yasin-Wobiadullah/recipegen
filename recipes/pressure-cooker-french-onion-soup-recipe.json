Without stirring, add onions. Season with salt and pepper. Seal pressure cooker and heat to high pressure (12.5 to 15 psi). Cook at high pressure for 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Let the pressure release naturally (float valve will drop; this will take about 30 minutes.) Remove lid from cooker.\nContinue cooking with lid off, stirring constantly, until liquid inside has completely reduced and the onions are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add sherry and bring to a simmer. Cook until alcohol smell is mostly gone, about 3 minutes. Add stock, thyme, and bay leaf, raise heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add cider vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.\nTo Serve:\nPreheat broiler and move oven rack to top position. Butter toasts and rub with garlic clove until fragrant. Spoon a small amount of broth into the bottoms of 8 ovenproof serving bowls, then top with half the toasts. Sprinkle some Gruy\u00e8re on top of toasts, then spoon more soup and onions on top, nearly filling the bowls. Set the remaining 8 toasts in each bowl, pushing to nearly submerge them. Top with remaining Gruy\u00e8re and set bowls on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil until cheese is melted and browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Garnish with chives and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nElectric or stovetop pressure cooker, rimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nYellow onions are your best all-purpose bet for this soup, but a mix of yellow, sweet (e.g., Vidalia), and red onions, as well as shallots, produces an even more complex flavor.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: Use the Pressure Cooker for Quick Caramelized Onions and French Onion Soup\nSoups\nFrench\nPressure Cooker\nGruyere\nOnions"
