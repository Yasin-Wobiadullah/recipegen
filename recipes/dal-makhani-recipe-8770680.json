Alternatively, using a mortar and pestle, pound ginger and garlic to form a smooth paste; transfer to a small bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon (15ml) water. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor the Dal:\nIn a large bowl, combine black urad dal and beans and cover by 2 inches with cool water. Soak for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours. Using your hands, vigorously swish dal and beans until water turns cloudy, about 30 seconds. Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain pulses, discarding the cloudy water.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn a medium pot or Dutch oven, combine dal, beans, bay leaf, 2 quarts (1.9L) water, and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, checking occasionally to skim any foam that collects at the top, until dal and beans are soft and break apart easily when pressed between your fingers, about 45 minutes. Once cooked, there should be about 1 inch of water above dal and beans; if water exceeds 1 inch, remove excess water with a ladle until remaining water just covers dal and beans by about 1 inch. Discard. Using a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon, mash 1/3 of the mixture.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add ginger and garlic paste and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chile powder, coriander, cumin, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until mixture darkens slightly and oil begins to separate, 4 to 6 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdd spiced tomato mixture to cooked dal and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and season to taste with salt. Stir in heavy cream and garam masala and simmer until mixture begins to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter. Serve immediately with steamed white rice, roti, or as an accompaniment to any Indian meal, and top with additional butter, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dal makhani can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days and frozen for up to 1 month. To thaw, let sit in refrigerator overnight.\nNotes\nDo not substitute urad dal with black lentils.\n4 tablespoons (84g) of store-bought ginger and garlic paste can be used in place of freshly made paste in step 4.\nTo use fresh tomatoes instead of canned, use a food processor or immersion blender to pur\u00e9e 3 medium ripe plum tomatoes and use in place of 1 cup canned diced tomatoes.\nVegetarian\nThe Latest\nIndian\nStovetop Beans"
