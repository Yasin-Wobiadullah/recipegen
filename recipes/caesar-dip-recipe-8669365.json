Serve with vegetables, lettuce and/or chips.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nSpecial Equipment\nKitchen scale, food processor\nNotes\nThis recipe was tested with Philadelphia brand cream cheese, which topped our Serious Eats\ncream cheese taste test,\nbut it will work with any brand of full-fat cream cheese.\nYou can easily double this recipe, if desired.\nThe longer the dip rests in the refrigerator, the better the flavors will meld. Consider refrigerating overnight.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStore in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
