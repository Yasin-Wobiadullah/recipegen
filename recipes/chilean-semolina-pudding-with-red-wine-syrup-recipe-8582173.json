Consistency should be similar to pomegranate syrup or honey. To check while cooking, pour a teaspoon of the syrup onto a cold flat dish so it cools down quickly. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, then pour into an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nFor the Semolina Pudding:\nIn a medium Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot, combine milk, sugar, salt, orange peel, and cinnamon sticks. Using a sharp paring knife, split vanilla pod lengthwise, then scrape out seeds and add them to milk along with pod; alternatively, add vanilla extract. Set over medium-low heat and, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, bring to a gentle boil, then immediately remove from heat. Set aside to infuse for 20 minutes, stirring often to avoid skin formation on top.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nUsing a slotted spoon, remove and discard orange zest, vanilla pod, and cinnamon sticks from the milk. Return milk to medium-low heat, and return to boil while stirring often. Using a whisk, gently sprinkle in semolina while whisking constantly. Continue whisking constantly until mixture is very thick and semolina is fully cooked, about 5 minutes. (Be careful to keep your face away from the pot, as the semolina can bubble and spit as it thickens.)\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nUsing a ladle and working quickly while the semolina is still fluid, pour hot pudding into 6 individual heat-safe serving bowls, or alternatively 1 large heat-safe serving bowl (see notes. Use a spatula to smooth the top of the pudding, then cover with plastic wrap (the plastic does not need to touch the surface of the semolina) and refrigerate until cold, 1 to 3 hours.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nBefore serving, let the red wine syrup come to room temperature. The pudding can be served in its dish, or unmolded onto a plate and sliced to serve. To unmold, flip the pudding bowl quickly over a flat tray or plate and place a hot and wet dish towel over the bottom of the pudding bowl. Leave it there for about 2 minutes and gently shake and lift the bowl to unmold the pudding. The pudding should separate easily from the bowl. Serve with the chilled red wine syrup.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nSpecial Equipment\nSmall saucepan\n, medium\nDutch oven\nor heavy-bottomed pot, serving dish or bowl\nNotes\nCoarse semolina is sold online by\nKing Arthur\nas well as this\nChilean brand\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe red wine syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 month.\nThe semolina pudding can be refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 3 days. I do not recommend freezing it.\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nThe Latest\nDesserts\nCornmeal\nSouth American",
