In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar with an electric beater until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture to bowl and beat until just combined. Dough should come together, if too crumbly, add 1 teaspoon water. Form dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.\nAdjust oven rack to upper and lower middle positions and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide dough in half and roll one half out onto a lightly floured surface to a thickness of approximately 1/8th- inch. Cut out 12 pumpkins using a pumpkin-shaped cookie cutter and transfer to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. Using a pairing knife, cut jack-o-lantern faces into 1/2 of the cookies. Bake cookies until just dry on top, about 10 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. When completely cooled, spread top of faceless cookies with about 1 teaspoon of peanut butter (more or less depending on how much you like peanut butter). Top with a face cookie to complete sandwiches.\nSpecial Equipment\nHand mixer\n, pumpkin cookie cutter,\nrimmed baking sheets\nCookies\nPeanut Butter\nHalloween",
