Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, stir chocolate into coffee and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk sugar, buttermilk, egg, yolk, oil, salt, and vanilla until combined. In a small bowl, whisk flour, cocoa, baking soda, and baking powder until combined. Whisk the dry ingredients into the wet until combined. Whisk in the coffee mixture until smooth.\nPour 1/3 batter in one pan and the remaining 2/3 in the other pan. Bake until just firm, about 20 to 25 minutes, respectively. Let cake cool in pans for 15 minutes, then invert cakes onto wire rack to cool completely before assembling cake.\nFor the Peanut Butter Mousse:\nIn a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat cream cheese with sugar, peanut butter, vanilla, and salt on medium speed until creamy and light, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Switch to whip attachment and beat cream on high speed to stiff but not dry peaks. Fold cream into peanut butter mixture. Keep chilled until ready to use.\nSlice the larger of the two cakes into two layers. Place on a serving plate and stack cake layers with peanut butter mousse. Keep chilled until ganache is ready to use.\nFor the Peanut Butter Ganache:\nUsing the microwave or in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, heat chocolate and cream until melted and smooth. Gently whisk in peanut butter. Chill until just firm enough to frost, about 30 minutes. Frost cake and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n, two 9-inch\ncake pans\nRead More\nChocolate Peanut Butter Cupcakes\nNo-Bake Crispy Corn Flake Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars\nBlack Bottom Peanut Butter Mousse Pie\nTriple Decker Peanut Butter Brownies\nCakes\nLayer Cake\nChocolate\nPeanut Butter",
