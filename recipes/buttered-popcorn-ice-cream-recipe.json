  "full_text": "Buttered Popcorn Ice Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n70 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nChurning/Freezing Time\n10 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n11 hrs 50 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nMakes\n1 quart\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\nheavy cream\n1\ncup\nwhole milk\n2\ncups\nfreshly popped butter-flavored popcorn\n(see note)\n6\negg yolks\n3/4\ncup\nsugar\nSalt\nto taste\nOptional:\n1\ncup\nCracker Jacks\nor caramel corn, chilled in freezer (optional)\nDirections\nIn a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring milk and cream to a bare simmer. Remove from heat, stir in popcorn, cover, and let steep for 1 hour.\nIn a second heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until pale in color and slightly thickened. Chill in refrigerator until dairy has finished steeping.\nPour dairy through a fine-mesh strainer into pot with egg-sugar mixture, then whisk rapidly until very well combined. Press on strained popcorn with a spoon against the strainer to squeeze out all remaining dairy.\nPut saucepan on medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until a custard forms on the back of a spoon but a swiped finger across the back leaves a clean line. Add salt to taste in 1/4 teaspoon increments, then strain custard into an airtight container and chill overnight, or at least 6 hours.\nThe next day, churn according to manufacturer's instructions. If using Cracker Jacks or caramel corn, add them in the last few seconds of churning and let churn until well integrated. Transfer ice cream to container and chill in freezer for at least 3 to 4 hours before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nNotes\nWhen it comes to popcorn, homemade is best for out-of-hand snacking, but fake butter microwavable popcorn is better for this ice cream. Its hydrogenated butter-flavored oils carry more \"buttered popcorn\" flavor than real butter, and they freeze less hard and clumpy. Since popcorn brands vary in salt levels, add salt to your ice cream to taste in small increments.\nIce Cream\nHeavy Cream",
