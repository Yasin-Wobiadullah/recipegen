Add mustard seed and cook until they begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Add asafoetida, anardana, cumin, coriander, black pepper, chile, and turmeric. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nAdd the potatoes and cauliflower and season generously with salt. Add water to come 1/3 up the sides of the vegetables. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to maintain simmer, cover, and cook until potatoes are mostly tender, replenishing water as necessary. Potatoes should still be too tough to eat at this stage.\nRemove lid, and increase heat to bring liquid to a rapid simmer and liquid begins to reduce. Scrape bottom of pan with spatula as the potatoes begin to stick, and mash them up against the sides of the pan. Meanwhile, warm the parathas in a dry skillet on medium-low heat, 1-2 minutes per side.\nWhen the potatoes are fully tender, add salt to taste, then set aside to cool slightly. Place 2 to 3 heaping tablespoons in center of warmed paratha, top with yogurt and mint chutney. Wrap in foil and serve, two kati per diner.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Anardana, Dried Pomegranate Seeds\nSandwiches\nIndian\nVegetarian Mains\nCauliflower\nYukon Gold Potatoes",
