  "full_text": "DIY Pear Liqueur Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nSteeping and Cooling Time\n168 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n168 hrs 55 mins\nServes\n18 servings\nMakes\n2 1/4 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nripe pears\n, divided (organic preferred)\n1\nvanilla bean\n1\ncup\nbrandy\n1\ncup\nsugar\n1\ncup\nwater\nDirections\nWash and chop one pear, discarding seeds and core. Leave the skin on. Split and scrape vanilla bean.\nPlace pear and vanilla bean in a sealable glass jar and cover with brandy. The jar should have enough room to add another cup of liquid later in the process. Seal and shake, then let steep for 2 days. Remove vanilla bean, and then let steep for another 3 days.\nChop the second pear, discarding seeds and core. Add it to a pot, along with water and sugar, then stir and bring to a boil on medium heat, about 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Let syrup mixture cool.\nOnce cooled, pour the syrup (with the fruit) into the steeping jar. Shake and let steep for 2 days. Taste, and if desired flavor is achieved, strain through a fine-mesh strainer and then a coffee filter into a bottle or jar.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer, coffee filter, paring knife\nNotes\nYou can substitute another spirit for brandy or replace the vanilla with another spice like ginger or a cinnamon stick. Vanilla releases its flavor a lot more quickly than pears do. This is also true of other strong ingredients like ginger and cinnamon. So be sure to taste your liqueur as it infuses to see when you need to remove your secondary flavoring ingredient.\nStraining through the coffee filter is recommended because it catches small, hard-to-see bits of pear that, when left in the liqueur, cause it to develop off flavors more quickly. I recommend keeping it no longer than two months. Refrigeration is not needed.\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines\nPear",
