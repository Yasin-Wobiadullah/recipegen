Churn mixture according to manufacturer's instructions. Serve right away as soft serve or transfer to an airtight container and harden in freezer for 4 to 5 hours. (Freezing in several smaller containers will greatly reduce hardening time.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nNotes\nThe optional milk powder will make for a creamier (and creamier-tasting) ice cream that holds up slightly better in the freezer after a couple days. If you're eating your ice cream day-of, the textural difference is negligible. But if you want something that stores a little better for a few days, it's a stabilizer to consider.\nIf you don't have Scotch, another whiskey or a dark rum works well.\nRead More\nScotch Vanilla Bean Ice Cream Recipe\nEasy Caramel Sauce Recipe\nReal Talk: Stop Bashing Ice Cream Stabilizers\nThe Real Rules of Making Boozy Ice Cream\nIce Cream\nSummer Desserts"
