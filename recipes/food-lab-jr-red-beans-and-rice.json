Set aside at room temperature for 8 to 16 hours. Drain and rinse. Now would be a good time to have kids pick out a few beans to\ngrow into sprouts\n.\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add sausage, onion, bell pepper, and celery. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until vegetables have softened and are just starting to brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. If you\u2019ve got a helper stool that lets your kids get up to stovetop level, consider letting them stir with a towel in their hand while you steady the pot. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 45 seconds.\nGrind some black pepper into a small bowl, then stir it into the pot, stirring and sniffing until it gives off fragrant aroma, about 30 seconds. Add beans, along with enough water to cover by about 2 inches (roughly 6 to 8 cups), smoked pork or turkey (if using), and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Cover and cook until beans are completely tender, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. (Older beans can take longer.)\nRemove the lid and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has thickened and turned creamy, about 20 minutes. If the pot starts to look dry before the stew turns creamy, add a cup of water and continue simmering. When it\u2019s nice and creamy, stir in the cider vinegar, then have your little helpers taste a spoonful and ask them if it needs any salt. Double check for yourself, add more salt as necessary, and then bring the whole pot to the table.\nServe the red beans over steamed white rice, adding hot sauce at the table as desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nIn an airtight container, the beans can be refrigerated for up to a week.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab Junior: Kid-Friendly Bibimbap\nThe Food Lab Junior: Kid-Friendly Pozole Verde\nThe Food Lab Junior: Kid-Friendly Dumpling\nHow I Got My Toddler Interested in Food and Cooking\nCajun & Creole\nStovetop Beans\nCannellini & Kidney Beans\nHam\nWhite Rice"
