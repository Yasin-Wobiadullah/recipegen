Add eggplant and let soak for 10 minutes. Drain well.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSet up a steamer and bring to full-steam over high heat. Add eggplant, cover, and cook until tender throughout but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Alternatively, place drained eggplant in a microwave-safe bowl, cover, and cook until tender throughout but not mushy, about 7 minutes at high power. Let cool to room temperature, then, using your hands, tear cooked eggplant into thick batons.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, seasoning oil, chili oil, black vinegar, and sugar until sugar is dissolved.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a bowl, combine eggplants, garlic, and scallion greens. Add dressing 1 tablespoon at a time while gently tossing until eggplant is sufficiently dressed, about 4 tablespoons. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nSteamer or microwave\nNotes\nThe key to deeply purple eggplants is picking younger eggplants that have deep purple skins and lightly colored seeds and flesh inside. Larger eggplant should also be split in half lengthwise.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe vinaigrette can be refrigerated for up to 1 week; whisk well before using. The dressed salad can be refrigerated for up to 2 days but will gradually lose its vibrant color.\nEggplant\nChinese\nThe Latest",
