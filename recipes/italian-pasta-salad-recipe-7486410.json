Transfer to a heatproof bowl, cover with plastic, and let stand 5 minutes. Place in a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Peel charred skin from bell peppers; discard skin and seeds. Slice peppers into 1/4-inch strips.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nIn a large bowl, stir together tomatoes, shallot, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, crushed red pepper, and 2 teaspoons (6g) salt. Marinate, uncovered, at room temperature for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and gently smashing some of the tomatoes using the back of a wooden spoon. Stir in sliced red bell peppers and 1/4 cup of oil; set aside.\nBring water to a boil in a 6- to 8-quart pot set over high heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons (18g) salt and return to a vigorous boil over high. Add pasta, and cook for 2 minutes longer than the package directions for al dente, until pasta is tender.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nWhile the pasta cooks, heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and 3 ounces (85g) salami; cook, stirring often, until garlic is light golden and salami starts to crisp along edges, 4 to 6 minutes; stir into tomato mixture.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nDrain pasta in a colander. Add pasta, banana peppers, olives, capers, and remaining 3 ounces salami to tomato mixture, stirring to combine. Let stand, uncovered, at room temperature, until flavors meld, about 30 minutes. Stir in mozzarella and basil.\nSerious Eats / Greg Dupree\nSpecial Equipment\nTongs, 6- to 8-quart pot, nonstick skillet, colander\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStore in an air-tight container, refrigerated, for up to 1 day. Stir and allow salad to come to room temperature before serving.\nPastas\nThe Latest\nSalads\nItalian-American\nSummer",
