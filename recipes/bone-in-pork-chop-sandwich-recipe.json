  "full_text": "Bone-In Pork Chop Sandwich\nClose\nJump to recipe\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n0 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nsoft hamburger buns\n4\ntablespoons\nbutter\n, divided\n2\nlarge\nonions\n, thinly sliced (about\n3\ncups\n)\nKosher salt\nand freshly ground black pepper\n4\nthin-cut pork chops\n, bone-in (or boneless, if you're scared)\n1/2\ncup\nall-purpose flour\n1\ntablespoon\ncanola or\nvegetable oil\n4\ntablespoons\nyellow mustard\n6 to 8\nsport peppers (or\npickled\nSerranos or\nJalape\u00f1os\n), stems removed, chopped\nDirections\nPreheat oven to 300\u00b0. Place buns on a rimmed baking sheet and set aside. Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned but still with some texture, 8 to 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl. Do not wipe out skillet.\nSeason pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour and then shake off excess. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and tablespoon canola oil to skillet and heat over medium high heat until foaming subsides. Add as many of the pork chops as will fit in one layer. Cook until browned on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the chops and brown on the other side, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and set aside when done. Repeat with any remaining chops.\nPlace buns in oven to warm through. Take one bun and smear both cut sides with mustard. Top the bottom bun with a pork chop, saut\u00e9ed onions, and a couple chopped sport peppers. Cap with the top bun, cut-side down. Repeat with remaining buns. Eat immediately, though be careful of the bone!\nNotes\nIf you are unable to find pickled sport peppers you can substitute pickled Serrano or Jalape\u00f1o peppers. But please know they are\nnot\nthe same thing.\nSandwiches\nPork Chop"
