Remove from microwave. Using a slotted spoon, transfer porcini to a cutting board and roughly chop. Add fresh mushroom scraps to container with porcini-infused stock and set aside. Alternatively, heat stock and dried mushrooms (if using) in a small saucepan until simmering, then remove from heat, transfer porcini to a cutting board and roughly chop; add fresh mushroom scraps to saucepan and set aside to infuse.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nHeat olive oil and butter in the base of a pressure cooker over high heat, swirling, until foaming subsides. Add fresh mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until excess moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are well browned, about 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nAdd onion, garlic, and chopped porcini (if using) and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) Stir in soy sauce and miso paste until evenly incorporated.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nAdd wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nPour stock into pot through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding mushroom stems. Scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker, either by running it under cold water if it is not electric or using the steam-release valve if it is electric.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nOpen pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; a creamy consistency should begin to develop. Stir in cream (if using), cheese, and herbs. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more. If it is too thick, stir in some hot water. It should flow slowly when you drag a trail through it with a spoon. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately on hot plates, passing extra cheese at the table.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric pressure cooker or countertop pressure cooker\n, microwave\nNotes\nI like to add a splash of heavy cream to my risotto just before serving\u2014it adds a velvety creaminess and smooths out all the flavors. Some folks prefer the stronger flavor of cream-free risotto. Taste before adding the cream if you are unsure.\nTo Cook Without a Pressure Cooker:\nFollow recipe through the end of step 4, using a large Dutch oven instead of a pressure cooker. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into the Dutch oven and add 2 more cups of broth. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked through, about 30 minutes. Stir in 1 to 2 more cups of broth to adjust consistency and continue with step 6.\nRead More\nPerfect Risotto Recipe\n12 Easy Risotto Recipes\nPressure Cooker\nPorcini Mushrooms\nRice & Grain Mains\nFall Mains"
