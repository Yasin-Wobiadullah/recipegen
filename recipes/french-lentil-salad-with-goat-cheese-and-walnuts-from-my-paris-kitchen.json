  "full_text": "French Lentil Salad with Goat Cheese and Walnuts From 'My Paris Kitchen'\nClose\nJump to recipe\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n60 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the Lentils:\n1 1/2 cups (\n270\ng\n)\nFrench green lentils\n(preferably from Le Puy)\n1\nbay leaf\n5\nsprigs\nthyme\n1\ncarrot\n, peeled and finely diced\n1\nsmall\nred onion\n, peeled and finely diced\n1\nrib\ncelery\n, finely diced\nFor the Dressing:\n1\ntablespoon\nred wine vinegar\n1 1/4\nteaspoons\nsea salt or\nkosher salt\n, plus more as needed\n1\nteaspoon\nDijon mustard\n1/3\ncup\n(60ml)\nolive oil\n, or half walnut oil and half olive oil\n1\nsmall\nshallot\n, peeled and minced\nFor Serving:\nFreshly\nground black pepper\n1/2 cup (\n30\ng\n) finely chopped\nfresh flat-leaf parsley\n1 cup (\n100\ng\n)\nwalnuts\nor pecans, toasted and coarsely chopped\n1 cup (\n130\ng\n) crumbled fresh or slightly aged\ngoat cheese\nor feta cheese\nDirections\nRinse the lentils and put them in a saucepan with plenty of lightly salted water, the bay leaf, and the thyme. Bring to a boil, decrease the heat to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes. Add the finely diced vegetables and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes, until the lentils are tender; be careful not to overcook them.\nWhile the lentils are cooking, make the dressing. Mix the vinegar, salt, mustard, oil, and shallot in a large bowl.\nDrain the lentils well and mix them into the dressing while still warm, stirring to coat the lentils. Remove the bay leaf and thyme and let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.\nAdd a few grinds of black pepper and mix in the parsley, chopped nuts, and goat cheese. Taste, and add additional salt, if desired. I serve the salad at room temperature or warm. If served warm, omit the goat cheese, or crumble it on top at the last minute, so it doesn\u2019t melt\u2014but instead, slightly softens. The salad can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated. Let it come to room temperature before serving; it may need to be re-seasoned once refrigerated.\nVegetarian Salads\nVegetarian Sides\nLentils\nGoat Cheese\nWalnuts"
