Pulse to combine. Add butter. Pulse until no large pieces of butter remain. Add egg and half and half. Pulse until a dough forms. If dry bits of flour remain, add a splash more half and half. Add cooked onions. Pulse until onion pieces are incorporated. Don't overmix or onion pieces will break up too much.\nTurn dough onto prepared baking sheet. Pat into a round. Cut into eight pieces. Bake until golden brown, about 18 minutes. Remove from oven. Follow score lines and cut into individual pieces. Allow to cool slightly before serving. These scones are best served the day they're baked.\nScones\nGluten-free Breakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch"
