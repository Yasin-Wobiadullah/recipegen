If using banana leaf, rinse banana leaf pieces under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Working with one piece of banana leaf at a time, hold banana leaf with tongs about 2 inches above medium-high flame of a gas burner, turning every 3 to 5 seconds, until soft and pliable, about 15 seconds. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining piece of banana leaf. Place banana leaf pieces in an 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pan or cast iron skillet, arranging them in an overlapping configuration to completely cover the bottom and sides of the pan, pressing down on them with your hands to ensure they are flush with the pan. Brush evenly with 1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon; 15g) melted butter and set aside. Alternatively, if not using banana leaf, grease an 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pan or cast iron skillet with melted butter or pan spray and\nline with parchment\n; set aside.\nRezel Kealoha\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together white rice flour, sweet rice flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined, about 1 minute. This dry mixture will look homogeneous well before it truly is, so use patience at this stage, and whisk longer than may seem necessary.\nRezel Kealoha\nIn a large bowl, whisk together 1 ounce (2 tablespoons; 30g) melted butter, sugar, coconut milk, and egg, until sugar is dissolved and mixture is thoroughly combined. Add flour mixture to coconut milk mixture and whisk together until completely smooth and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute. Using a flexible spatula, fold batter once or twice from the bottom up, then scrape into prepared pan.\nRezel Kealoha\nBake until batter is beginning to set at the edges, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and evenly distribute macapuno in a single layer over top. Return pan to oven and continue to bake until cake is puffed, edges are lightly browned, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with few moist crumbs attached, or to an internal temperature of around 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C), about 12 minutes.\nRezel Kealoha\nRemove from oven and preheat broiler. Brush top of cake with remaining melted butter and lightly sprinkle sugar evenly over top. Broil until cake is golden brown and macapuno is slightly caramelized, about 2 minutes.\nRezel Kealoha\nTransfer pan to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Run a butter knife along edges to loosen, then invert onto a wire rack, remove banana leaves or parchment, and place cake right side up on serving platter. Serve warm.\nRezel Kealoha\nSpecial equipment\n8-inch\ncast iron skillet\nor\nanodized aluminum cake pan\nNotes\nFresh or frozen banana leaves can be purchased at Asian markets and online. To store unused fresh banana leaves, wrap tightly in plastic, transfer to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze for up to 3 months. If using frozen banana leaves, defrost in the refrigerator overnight.\nI prefer Koda Farms brand mochiko (sweet rice flour) for its fine, smooth texture. You can substitute other brands of sweet rice flour, just be sure to sift it twice first to get rid of any lumps before adding it to your bibingka batter.\nMacapuno, or coconut sport strings, are preserved young coconut strips made from a variety of coconut that has a soft jelly-like flesh and contains very little water. It tastes sweeter than your typical coconut and is commonly used in Filipino desserts. Macapuno can be found in Filipino or Asian markets and online.\nIf desired, you can add other toppings, such as 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup frozen thawed grated coconut, and 1 sliced salted duck egg after you brush the top with butter and sprinkle it with sugar.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe batter can be prepared in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nWrapped tightly in foil or plastic, bibingka will keep for up to 3 days at room temperature. Reheat in the microwave in 10-second intervals.\nFilipino\nBaking\nChristmas Desserts\nChristmas\nRice & Grains",
