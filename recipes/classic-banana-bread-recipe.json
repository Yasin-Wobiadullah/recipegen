Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Peel bananas (for roughly 12 ounces or 340g fruit) and mash with Greek yogurt, eggs, and vanilla in a medium bowl. If bananas are underripe, cover bowl with plastic and let mixture stand 30 minutes.\nCombine flour, sugar, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and coconut oil in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low until coconut oil disappears into a mealy powder. Add banana mash and continue mixing only until the floury bits disappear. Fold in nuts with a flexible spatula, scrape into prepared pan(s), and spread into an even layer. Bake until well risen and golden brown, or to an internal temperature of around 206\u00b0F (97\u00b0C), about 70 minutes for a large loaf or 45 for small. Wrapped tightly in foil, banana bread will keep up to 3 days at room temperature or 1 week in the fridge. Serve with Banana Whipped Cream, if desired.\nFor Banana Nut Muffins:\nDivide batter evenly among 12 lightly greased nonstick muffin cups, adding approximately 1/2 cup (4 ounces; 120g) to each cup. Bake until domed and just beginning to brown around the edges, about 25 minutes.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n;\none 10 1/2\u2013 by 5 1/2\u2013inch loaf pan, two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans, or one standard muffin tin\nNotes\nAvoid Greek yogurt thickened with gum, gelatin, or pectin. Look for brands that contain only milk and active cultures; this recipe was tested with both Fage and Chobani. If you don't happen to have any oat flour on hand, simply use an equal amount of whole wheat or all-purpose flour. For a slightly sweeter variation, replace the toasted nuts with an equal amount of dark or milk chocolate chips.\nBanana\nQuick Breads\nBreakfast & Brunch\nMuffins"
