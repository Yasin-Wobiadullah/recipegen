(Timing will vary depending on the heat of the grill and the distance of the skewers from the heat source.) Try not to move the skewers too soon, or they can stick and tear; if they remain stuck in spots when you try to move them, slide a thin metal object down between the grill grates and gently lift from below to free them. Once skewers are free, move them around to ensure the cheese doesn't sink too far between the grill grates.\nTurn skewers and repeat on opposite side.
