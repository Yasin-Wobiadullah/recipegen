Frozen, the tofu will be yellow and leathery in appearance.\nWhen you are ready to cook, run the block of tofu under hot water to remove the cheesecloth, which will have adhered to the surface of the tofu. Bring a large pot of water to boil and drop in tofu. Boil for 15 minutes, or until the entire block of tofu is softened.\nCut tofu into 1-inch squares and place into a saucepan along with the rest of the simmering ingredients (stock, soy sauce, sake, and mirin). Over medium-low heat, simmer for at least 25 minutes, or until tofu has fully absorbed all but 1 tablespoon of the liquid.\nNotes\nIf you are braising cubes of meat in a soy sauce dish, toss the cubes of tofu into the pot during the last half hour of braising.\nMains\nJapanese\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Tofu\nTofu",
