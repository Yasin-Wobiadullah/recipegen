  "full_text": "Roast Chicken With Soubise (Onion Sauce)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n65 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nTotal\n80 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nlarge\nchicken\n, about\n4 to 5\npounds\nKosher salt\nand freshly ground black and/or white pepper\n3\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n,\n1\ntablespoon\nsoftened\n2\nmedium\nonions\n, thinly sliced\n1 1/2\ncups\nheavy cream\n1\nteaspoon\ncurry powder\nor vadouvan spice, optional (see note)\nDirections\nSet oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Using sharp kitchen shears, remove spine from chicken and reserve for another use (such as\nhomemade chicken stock\n). Flatten chicken by placing skin side up on cutting board and applying firm pressure to breast bone. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nSet wire rack in rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Position chicken so that breasts are aligned with center of baking sheet and legs are close to edge. Roast for 20 minutes, then rub skin all over with the 1 tablespoon softened butter. Return to oven and cook until thickest part of breast close to bone registers 150\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer and joint between thighs and body registers at least 170\u00b0F, 25 to 45 minutes longer.\nMeanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat until foaming. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and most liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Stir in cream and simmer for 5 minutes.\nTransfer hot onions and cream to a blender. Add curry powder or vadouvan if using, and blend, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high, until a smooth sauce forms. If desired, pass sauce through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids with a spoon, for an even more refined texture. Return onion sauce to saucepan and season with salt and white pepper (note that sauce should have a texture that's thicker than most sauces but thinner than a puree). Keep warm.\nCarve chicken and serve, spooning sauce all around.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender, rimmed baking sheet with rack\nNotes\nVadouvan, a French curry powder flavored with shallots and garlic, is available in specialty food stores and online.\nRead More\nSoubise (French Onion Sauce)\nChicken Mains\nFrench\nRoasted Chicken\nWhole Chicken\nHeavy Cream",
