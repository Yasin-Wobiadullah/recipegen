  "full_text": "The Secret Ingredient (Chamomile): Chamomile Rice Pudding with Tea-Soaked Golden Raisins Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nTotal\n45 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\nwater\n3\ntablespoons\nof dried\nedible\nchamomile\nflowers\n4\ncups\nmilk\n1\ntablespoon\nbutter\n1\ncup\narborio rice\n1\nchamomile tea bag\n1/4\ncup\ngolden raisins\n1/4\ncup\nsugar\nPinch\nsalt\n1/4\ncup\ncream\nto finish (optional)\nHoney\nDirections\nStart as though you were making a risotto. In two separate pots, heat the water and the milk. Place the chamomile flowers (not the tea bags) in the water, and allow to steep for at least ten minutes. Strain the flowers out, and return the chamomile water to the pan to keep warm.\nMelt the butter in a wide pan with sides over medium low heat. Add the rice, and stir to coat, cooking for just a minute in the butter until the rice turns translucent.\nUse a ladle to add the water bit by bit to the rice, adding more only as it is absorbed, and stirring continuously. Once you have used all the water, switch to milk, and continue to stir.\nMeanwhile, brew a cup of chamomile tea with the tea bag. Place the golden raisins in the tea to rehydrate.\nOnce most of the milk has been used, and the pudding has reached a thick, porridge-like texture, add the sugar and stir it in to melt over the heat. Add the pinch of salt as well.\nTake the pan off the heat. Stir in a splash of cream to finish, and serve hot, in separate bowls or ramekins. Strain the golden raisins out of the tea, and top the pudding with them. Serve with honey alongside.\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nRice & Grains",
