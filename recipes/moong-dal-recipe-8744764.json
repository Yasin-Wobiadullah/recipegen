In a medium pot or Dutch oven, combine mung beans, 6 cups (1.4L) water, ground turmeric, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until beans have cracked open slightly, about 30 minutes. (They should not be mushy.)\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nFor the Masala:\nIn a medium saucepan heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add asafoetida, cumin seeds, and mustard seeds. Cook, allowing the seeds to sizzle and pop, about 10 seconds, then add ginger and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add green chile and onion and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent and beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add coriander and chile powder, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until softened and broken down, 3 to 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nTransfer masala to cooked mung beans and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and season to taste with salt and lime juice as needed. Remove from heat, then stir in cilantro and 1 tablespoon ghee. Serve immediately with white rice, roti, or as an accompaniment to any Indian meal.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nNotes\nWhole dried mung beans are available online and at many South Asian grocery stores.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nMoong dal can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
