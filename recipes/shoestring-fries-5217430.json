In a large, tall-sided pot, combine water, salt, and vinegar and bring to 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C) over high heat. Drain potatoes, add them to pot, stir, and let water come back up to around 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) (try not to exceed 170\u00b0), about 1 minute. Cover pot, turn off heat, and let potatoes sit for 15 minutes. Using spider strainer, transfer potatoes to prepared baking sheet and let cool, about 15 minutes; discard water.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSet a wire rack in a second rimmed baking sheet, and line with paper towels. In a large Dutch oven or carbon steel wok, bring oil to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C) over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and carefully add 1/8 of potatoes to hot oil (oil temperature should drop to about 360\u00b0F or 182\u00b0C) and cook until vigorous bubbling subsides and potatoes just begin to color, about 30 seconds. Using spider strainer, transfer potatoes to prepared baking sheet, and let cool at least 30 minutes before proceeding to second fry.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRepeat step 2 process with remaining potatoes.\nLine a large bowl with paper towels. Bring oil back up to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C) over high heat. Add 1/4 of cooled, oil-blanched potatoes to oil and cook just until potatoes are crisp and just slightly blonder than you'd like, about 40 seconds. Transfer fries to prepared bowl, taste, and season with more salt or seasoning mix, to taste. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nDutch oven\nor\ncarbon steel wok\n;\nspider strainer\n;\nbaking sheets\n;\nwire rack\n; a lot of paper towels.\nNotes\nFor safety reasons, this recipe calls for adding a relatively small amount of shoestrings in each fry step. However, if, after fry-blanching the first batch of shoestring fries, it seems to you that you can\nsafely\nadd more shoestrings to the hot oil without causing an overflow, by all means do so. But do it carefully, by which I mean incrementally.\nFor darker, crunchier shoestring fries, bring the salted, vinegared blanching water in step 1 to a rolling boil, add the potatoes, bring the water back up to a boil, cook for about 1 minute and 30 seconds, and then drain. You can then proceed with the recipe as written.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce fried for the second time, shoestring fries are best served and enjoyed immediately. If you want to prep in advance and break up the cooking process, you can follow the recipe through step 3, cover and refrigerate (or freeze) the cooled oil-blanched potatoes, and complete the second fry at a later time. This approach is convenient for professional kitchens outfitted with deep fryers, but is more of a hassle for home cooks who have to make room on their stovetop or somewhere in their kitchen for a pot of oil between rounds of frying.\nRead More\nPerfect Thin and Crispy French Fries Recipe\nCrispy Baked Potato Wedges Recipe\nWhy Double Fry French Fries?\nExtra Crispy Duck Fat-Fried Fingerling Potatoes Recipe\nPotatoes\nThe Latest"
