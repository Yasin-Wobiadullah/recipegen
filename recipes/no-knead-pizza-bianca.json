Add water and stir with a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature overnight.\nThe next day, lightly flour the dough and your hands. Scrape dough out of the bowl onto a well-floured piece of parchment paper set inside a rimmed baking sheet and gently fold dough into an even blob in the center. Dust with flour and cover with a clean kitchen towel. allow to rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.\n30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position, place a baking stone on it (or a double stack of rimmed baking sheets) and preheat oven to 550\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). Gently stretch the dough into an even rectangular shape (you shouldn't have to lift it). Carefully stipple the top surface with your fingertips. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse sea salt and rosemary if using. Transfer entire baking sheet with dough to pizza stone.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nBake for 5 minutes just until the pizza is slightly firm. Remove from oven and transfer pizza to a pizza peel. Discard parchment paper. Return pizza to bake directly on the baking stone until burnished golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes longer. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Transfer to a large cutting board, cut into 8 or 12 rectangular slices, and serve.\nRead More\nHomemade Roman-Style Pizza Pockets (Trapizzini)\nBasic Square Pan Pizza Dough Recipe (Sicilian-Style Dough)\nHomemade Focaccia Bread\nFocaccia di Recco\nYeast Breads"
