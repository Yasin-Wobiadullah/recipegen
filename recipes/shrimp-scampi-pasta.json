In a large bowl, toss shrimp with 3/4 teaspoon (3g) kosher salt and baking soda until evenly coated. Let stand for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a 12-inch stainless-steel skillet or large saut\u00e9 pan, heat 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil over high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp in an even layer and cook, stirring and turning shrimp occasionally, until pink, barely cooked through, and just starting to turn lightly golden in spots, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and, using a slotted spoon, flexible slotted offset spatula, or tongs, transfer shrimp to a plate.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil to skillet along with garlic and red pepper flakes. Set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until garlic is just starting to turn golden, about 1 minute; lower heat if necessary to prevent scorching.\nAdd vermouth and boil over high heat, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until raw alcohol smell is mostly gone and vermouth has reduced by about half, about 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd butter and cook, stirring and swirling pan rapidly as butter melts to create a silky, emulsified sauce. Remove from heat, add lemon juice, and season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta, stirring frequently for first 30 seconds to prevent noodles from sticking, until just shy of al dente (about 2 minutes less than package directions).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing tongs, transfer pasta to skillet, reserving pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 1 cup (235ml) pasta cooking water, then transfer to skillet. Add 1/4 cup (60ml) reserved pasta cooking water to skillet, set over high heat and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce is slightly thickened and coats noodles with a creamy glaze, 2 to 3 minutes, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nReturn shrimp to skillet along with any accumulated juices, lemon zest, parsley, and remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, tossing to combine thoroughly. Remove from heat. Season with salt, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nDivide pasta and shrimp among serving bowls and serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch skillet or large saut\u00e9 pan\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nShrimp scampi is best made right before serving.\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nItalian-American\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine\nShrimp"
