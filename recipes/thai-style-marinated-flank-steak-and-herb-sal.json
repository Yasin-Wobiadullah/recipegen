Add oil to remaining half and whisk to combine. Place flank steak inside a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with marinade.

Proceed to step 4.\nAlternatively, to finish indoors:\nHeat 2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil in a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add steak and cook, turning frequently, until an instant-read thermometer registers 125\u00b0F for medium-rare or 135\u00b0F for medium, reducing heat as necessary if steak smokes excessively or starts to burn. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and allow to rest 5 to 10 minutes.\nThinly slice beef against the grain and transfer to a large bowl. Add herbs, shallots, bean sprouts, and reserved marinade, and toss to combine. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nIf you're using a gas grill, set half of the burners to high and leave the others off for two-zone grilling.\nAn equivalent weight of skirt, flap, or hanger steak can be used in place of flank steak.\nRead More\nSteakhouse-Style Grilled Marinated Flank Steak\nGrilled Marinated Flank Steak Fajitas\nFlank Steaks\nThai\nGrilled Steaks\nSummer Mains",
