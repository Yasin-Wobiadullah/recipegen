Cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes, until warm to the touch. Increase heat to medium and cook, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until you can see steam rising from the custard and it registers 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 8 minutes. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a large stainless steel bowl, pressing gently with a flexible spatula to release the liquid trapped in the crumbs, then stir in the vanilla.\nFill a sink compartment or extra-large bowl with a few inches of ice water and place bowl with custard inside, stirring from time to time, until cool, about 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), about 4 hours. (The ice cream base can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week.) Churn in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer.\nWhen ice cream looks thick and light, shut off the machine; if desired, fold in crushed cookies with the chilled spatula, then transfer ice cream to the chilled container. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until hard, about 4 hours.\nSpecial equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier, fine-mesh sieve, stainless steel mixing bowl,\nice cream maker\nNotes\nWhile this recipe was developed as a way to use up the cookie scraps left over from\nHomemade Oreos\n, it works just as well with store-bought Oreos (although you'll need to scrape out the filling, as the ice cream base is made from wafers alone).\nThis Recipe Appears In\nLove Cookies 'n' Cream?
