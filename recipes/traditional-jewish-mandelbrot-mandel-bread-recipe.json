Place each log on pan and flatten slightly. Bake until well-risen and firm, about 25-30 minutes. Cool the logs on the pans and racks.\nReset racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Using sharp serrated knife, slice baked logs diagonally about every 1/2 inch. Place cinnamon-sugar mixture in a shallow dish and turn the cut cookies in it. Return biscotti to the pans, cut side down, and bake until dry and crisp, up to 20 minutes longer.\nStore cooled cookies between sheets of parchment or wax paper in tin or plastic container with tight-fitting container.\nCookies"
