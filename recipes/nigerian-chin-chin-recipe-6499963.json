Using the large holes of a box grater, grate butter over flour mixture. Using your hands, toss butter with flour mixture until butter is evenly distributed.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nIn the center of the butter-flour mixture, make a well about 4-inches wide. Slowly pour milk mixture into the well. Using a flexible spatula or wooden spoon, gradually stir butter-flour mixture into milk mixture until combined. Using your hands, knead dough against sides of bowl or on a lightly-floured work surface until it comes together in a soft, but not sticky, ball. Cover dough with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and rest for 10 minutes. (Alternatively, shape dough into a flat, round disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 6 months; bring to room temperature before rolling).\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nOn a lightly-floured work surface, divide dough into 4 equal portions (about 195g each), and shape each into a ball. Working with one ball of dough at a time, roll out dough to form a 5-inch circle about 1/4 inch thick, adding more flour as needed underneath and on top of dough to prevent sticking. Using a sharp knife or pizza wheel, cut dough into 1/2-inch-wide diamonds, dipping the wheel or knife in flour as needed to keep dough from sticking. Transfer dough pieces to a lightly floured rimmed baking sheet, dust with flour, and gently toss to prevent sticking. Repeat with remaining dough balls.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nLine a large strainer with paper towels. In a wok or large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat to 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Divide the dough pieces into roughly 3 or 4 batches. Working with one batch of dough pieces at a time, add pieces to hot oil using a spider or slotted spoon and fry, turning pieces as they cook, until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer chin chin to prepared strainer.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nReturn oil to 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and repeat frying with remaining batches of dough. Transfer chin chin to a serving bowl and serve warm or let cool completely, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nSpecial Equipment\nBox grater, pizza wheel (optional), wok or large Dutch oven\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nCooled chin chin can be stored in an airtight container or zipper-lock bag at room temperature for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to 3 months.\nDesserts\nNigerian\nThe Latest"
