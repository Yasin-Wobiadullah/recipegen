After the coconut milk mixture has boiled hard for 30-40 seconds, remove the saucepan from the stove.\nPour the coconut milk mixture into the mold(s) of your choice. Allow it to cool.\nMeanwhile, whisk together the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon agar, instant coffee, and water in another saucepan and bring it to a hard boil over medium-high heat. Once the mixture has boiled for 30-40 seconds, remove the saucepan from the stove.\nCheck to see whether the coconut agar layer has hardened. You don't want it to be completely solid; otherwise the two layers will not stick together and slide off one another when you serve the dessert. With your finger, touch on the surface of the coconut agar layer lightly to see if there's some resistance on the surface. If so, holding the saucepan as close to the surface of the coconut layer as possible, very gently pour the coffee layer on top of the previous layer.\nLet the agar set. This should take about 40 to 45 minutes at room temperature and 20 minutes in the refrigerator.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMy Thai: Coffee-Coconut Agar Dessert\nDesserts\nThai\nStovetop\nCoconut Milk & Cream",
