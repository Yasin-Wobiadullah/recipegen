Grind sausage meat according to manufacturer's directions into the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl. If finer texture is desired, chill meat in freezer for 15 minutes before grinding again.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the sausage meat on medium-high speed until it becomes tacky and sticky, about 1 minute. Alternatively, knead by hand for 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a zipper-lock bag and seal. Sausage will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator. Stuff into casings or cook as desired.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nMeat grinder\n,\nstand mixer\nNotes\nYou\nmust\nuse a scale for this sausage. There is no way to accurately estimate the amount of salt needed otherwise. This recipe can be made with pre-ground pork as well. Mix ingredients as directed in step one, allow to rest at least 8 hours, then skip the grinding step and proceed as directed in Step 3.\nPizza\nHomemade Sausages"
