  "full_text": "Cheese-Stuffed Colombian-Style Arepas Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nResting Time\n5 mins\nTotal\n45 mins\nServes\n4 arepas\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\nmasarepa\n(see notes)\n2\nounces\n(about\n1/2\ncup\n) finely crumbled\nqueso fresco\n(optional, see notes)\n1\ncup\nwater\n, plus more as necessary\n1\nteaspoon\nvegetable oil\nKosher salt\n1/2\npound\nmozzarella\nor other good melting cheese, sliced or grated\n2\nteaspoons\nbutter\nDirections\nPreheat toaster oven or oven with rack in the center to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). Combine masarepa, crumbled cheese (if using), water, and vegetable oil in a medium bowl and knead with hands until a dough is formed. Take a small amount and flatten it between your palms. If the edges crack, knead in more water, 1 tablespoon at a time until dough is supple and smooth but not sticky. Season dough to taste with salt, then cover and set aside for 5 minutes.\nDivide dough into 8 even pieces and roll into balls. Working on a wooden cutting board or a regular cutting board with a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper on top of it, flatten each ball down to a disk about 5 inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick.\nPlace 1/4 of cheese into center of one disk, leaving a 1/2-inch gap all around.\nPlace a second disk on top and carefully seal the edges all around, trying to remove as much air from the center as possible.\nUse one hand to shape the edges of the arepa so that it is an even round disk.\nMelt butter in a 12-inch cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-low heat (see notes). Add arepas and cook, moving them around the pan and rotating them occasionally, until first side is charred in spots and a dry crust has formed, about 5 minutes. Flip arepas and cook on second side until a dry crust has formed, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a baking sheet and place in oven until heated through and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch cast iron skillet\nor\nnonstick skillet\nNotes\nMasarepa is dehydrated cooked cornmeal. It is available in the Latin section of most supermarkets in either white or yellow varieties. This recipe calls for white, but they can be freely substituted. Popular brands include Goya and P.A.N.\nCrumbled cheese can be added to the dough if desired. Depending on the moisture level of the cheese, you may not need all the water. Colombian-style queso fresco is ideal. If you can't find it, substitute cotija, ricotta salata, or feta.\nArepas can also be cooked on a greased panini press or a grill over low heat.\nRead More\nColombian-Style Arepas (Griddled or Grilled Corn Cakes)\nVenezuelan-Style Arepas (Arepas Rellenas)\nVenezuelan-Style Arepas with Pulled Pork (Arepas Rumberas)\nCorn\nVenezuelan\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nCheese",
