Combine chile powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, coriander, and salt. Set aside.\nSimmer and Roast the Carrots:\nPlace carrots in a large pot, cover with water, and season heavily with salt. Heat over high heat until boiling. Reduce to a simmer and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and allow to dry for 5 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons spice blend, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and garlic. Toss to combine. Transfer to foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread out in an even layer. Roast until caramelized, about 40 minutes, turning once or twice during roasting. Transfer to a large bowl.\nMake the Mole\n: While carrots roast, heat vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Set aside a small handful of the sliced onion and add remaining onions and garlic to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add remaining spice blend and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add sesame seeds, chocolate, peanut butter, pumpkin seeds, stock, raisins, orange juice, and chipotle peppers. Stir until homogenous. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender. Add vinegar. Blend on high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes, adding more stock as necessary to adjust consistency to a thick, batter-like texture. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nAssemble the Salad:\nToss cooked carrots, remaining onions, radishes, and greens/herbs with lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil. Spread some of mole mixture onto a serving plate. Top with carrots, radishes, and greens. Dollop more mole mixture on top of salad and garnish with pumpkin seeds and chile flakes. Drizzle with olive oil and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nblender\nRead More\nCharred, Oven-Roasted Carrot Salad With Feta Cheese\nRoasted Carrots With Black Sesame Dressing\nRoasted Root Vegetables With Sweet Lime Dressing\nChilled Carrots With Tahini-Ginger Dressing\nCarrot Salad With Yogurt, Ghee, and Barberry Dressing\nSalads\nDairy-free Salads\nCarrots\nFall Salads\nThanksgiving Side Dishes",
