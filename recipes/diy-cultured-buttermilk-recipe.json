  "full_text": "DIY Cultured Buttermilk Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nActive\n2 mins\nCulturing/Chilling time\n30 hrs\nTotal\n30 hrs 5 mins\nServes\n2 servings\nMakes\n2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ntablespoons\nbuttermilk\n(store-bought or activated dried starter)\n2\ncups\nmilk\n(whole, 2%, or skim, depending on your nutritional needs and preferences)\nDirections\nIn a mason jar or other glass container, thoroughly mix the starter and milk. Cover with a coffee filter or piece of cheese cloth (do not seal tightly with a lid) and leave to culture out of drafts at a warm room temperature (between 70-78\u00b0F or 21-26\u00b0C is recommended) until milk has clabbered (10-24 hours).\nTo test if the milk has thickened, tip the jar slightly. It should move away from the wall of the jar as a single mass. Just as with yogurt making, once the milk sets, it will get more tart the longer you allow the culturing to continue.\nRefrigerate to halt culturing for at least 6 hours. Stir before using.\nSpecial Equipment\nMason jar or other glass container, coffee filter or cheesecloth\nNotes\nYou can make larger (or smaller) volumes as needed. I use a ratio of one tablespoon starter for every cup milk with reliable results. Unless your culture was not designed to be perpetuated (some freeze-dried options fall into this category), you can reserve a bit of each batch to culture the next.\nSome recipes indicate that you should pasteurize your milk (at 180\u00b0F) before culturing or at least warm it to 76\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). This step is entirely unnecessary, as store-bought milk is all pasteurized before it hits the shelves.\nRead More\nButtermilk Ice Cream\nThe Best Buttermilk-Brined Southern Fried Chicken\nThe Food Lab's Buttermilk Biscuits\nButtermilk Vanilla Waffles\nBest Buttermilk Blue Cheese Dressing\nButtermilk"
