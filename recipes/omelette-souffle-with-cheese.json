Scrape souffl\u00e9 base into pan. Using spatula, spread souffl\u00e9 base into even circle and smooth out the surface. Cover and cook until bottom of omelette is browned and top is just barely set (or even a little loose still, if you prefer). Scatter remaining cheese on top; cover once more and cook until cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute longer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCarefully slide the omelette out of the pan and onto a warm serving plate, folding it over itself.
