Cover, transfer to refrigerator, and let soak for at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours. Drain and rinse.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nIn a large stock pot or Dutch oven, combine pickled pig tail, cured salt beef, and beef chuck, (if using). Cover meat with 3 1/2 quarts (910g) cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer (adjusting heat as needed to maintain simmer) until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nMeanwhile, cut any woody stems from callaloo leaves and separate leaves from stalks; discard stalks. Transfer leaves to a medium bowl, add 1 teaspoon salt, then fill bowl with cold water and stir vigorously to wash well of all debris or sand. Drain well, then repeat rinsing steps if needed until water is clear.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nOnce meat is tender, add callaloo and coco heart to Dutch oven and simmer until greens are wilted and tender, about 15 minutes. Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, remove cooked callaloo and coco heart and transfer to a blender jar along with 1 cup (237 ml) cooking liquid. Pulse mixture in blender to a coarse (but not fully smooth) puree. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nAdd yam, coco, okra, and green pepper to Dutch oven and continue to simmer, adjusting heat as needed.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nFor the Spinners (Dumplings):\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together flour and a large pinch of salt. Add 1/2 cup (118ml) cold water and knead until a dough ball forms. Let rest 15 minutes. Tear off small pieces of dough and roll into cigarette-sized strips. Stir shaped spinners (dumplings)\u00a0into Dutch oven with Scotch bonnet peppers, scallions, thyme, and garlic. Return to simmer.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nOnce simmering, add pureed greens to Dutch oven and continue to cook for 30 minutes. Stir in coconut milk and cook until warmed through and soup has thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in janga or shrimp, if using, and simmer until opaque and just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Season pepperpot with salt and pepper to taste.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nFor Serving:\nRemove Scotch bonnet peppers, scallions, and thyme sprigs. Serve pepperpot with buttered sliced hardo bread, coco bread, or thin cassava wafers (which can be found in Caribbean grocery stores), and Pickapeppa sauce.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge stock pot or Dutch oven with lid, blender\nNotes\nA pressure cooker may be used in place of the Dutch oven in this recipe. If using a pressure cooker, in Step 2, cover pot, bring to high pressure, and cook under pressure for 30 minutes. Carefully release pressure, and continue with Step 3.\nCured salt beef, is a corned beef\u2013like product sold in Jamaican and Caribbean markets, as are salt pork and salted pig tail.\nCallaloo is a Caribbean term for some types of leafy greens, but it can refer to different plants depending on the context. In Jamaica, amaranth leaves are often used, but taro (dasheen) leaves can also work. In a pinch, you can substitute kale or collard greens as well.\nCoco heart are the heart-shaped leaves of the coco (taro) plant.\nCoco is the Jamaican name for taro root. You can also use eddoes, a relative of taro.\nYellow yams are available at Caribbean and some African grocers. To cut yellow yams, rinse well under running water to remove any dirt. Rub 1 teaspoon oil on hands (to form a light protective barrier from the slimy yam flesh) and peel. Immediately transfer to a bowl of salted cold water to prevent oxidation. Working with one yam at a time, dice, then return to salted water until ready to use.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPepperpot can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\nSoups\nThe Latest\nStovetop\nJamaican\nGreens"
