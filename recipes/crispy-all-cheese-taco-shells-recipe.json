Wipe a thin layer of oil into a small cast iron or non-stick skillet and place over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Place ring mold in center of skillet and sprinkle a very light layer of cheese inside it. It should form an even layer in which you can still see the black bottom of the pan poking through in spots. Carefully remove ring mold and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nCook cheese until it stops bubbling and is an even golden brown throughout, adjusting heat so that pan is hot but not smoking (you should never take it above medium-low). Use a thin metal spatula to carefully remove cheese from pan.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nWorking quickly, drape the cheese over the handle of a thick wooden spoon placed over two overturned cups and form into a shell shape. It will harden within a few seconds. Transfer to a plate to cool completely. Repeat with remaining cheese to make more shells. After cooling completely, these shells can be stored in an air-tight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. Fill as desired (such as\nwith soft scrambled eggs\n, or with\ncharred corn\n), and serve.\nSerious Eats / J.
