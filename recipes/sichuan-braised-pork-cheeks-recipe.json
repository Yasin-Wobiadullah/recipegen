Dry pork cheeks and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add them to the pan in batches, taking care not to crowd the meat. Cook until the surface is browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side, flipping only once or twice so as not to disturb browning. Remove with tongs to a plate and brown remaining cheeks, adding more oil if needed. Set aside.\nPreheat oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Add chili bean paste to the Dutch oven and stir-fry until the paste starts to smell fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add stock, wine, ginger, scallions, soy sauce, and spices. Return pork cheeks to pan, stir to combine, and bring the mixture to a simmer\nCover pan and transfer to oven. Braise until cheeks are very tender, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Allow meat to cool and settle in liquid (for best results cover and refrigerate overnight). Skim fat from surface and reheat gently. Garnish with chopped cilantro. Serve with rice and vegetables.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nRead More\nPork Cheeks Braised in Tomato Wine Sauce Recipe\nPork Mains\nChinese\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork",
