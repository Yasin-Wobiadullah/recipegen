Set aside while you prepare the rest of the vegetables.\nMeanwhile, place red onions in a 1- to 2-quart container and cover with hot tap water. Set aside while you prepare the rest of the vegetables.\nIf using fava beans and English peas in their pods, shuck the beans and peas from their pods, keeping them separate. Discard the pods. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Working with one vegetable at a time, blanch the favas, peas, asparagus, snap peas, and broccolini in the boiling water for 1 minute each, transfer to the ice bath to cool, then transfer to a paper towel-lined tray and pat dry. Remove and discard the skins from each individual fava bean. Set vegetables aside.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together lemon juice and mustard. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain, rinse, and dry the cucumber and red onion. Add blanched vegetables, cucumber, onion, arugula, sunflower seeds, and mozzarella to the dressing, and toss to combine, adjusting seasoning with salt and pepper.\nTo serve, spread a spoonful of labneh on the bottom of individual plates, or cover the bottom of a large serving platter with the labneh. Drizzle the labneh with olive oil, then pile the salad on top. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nor\ncolander\n;\nwhisk\nRead More\nSpring Salad of Asparagus, Ramps, Snap Peas, and Peas Recipe\nSpring Vegetable Salad With Poached Egg and Crispy Bread Crumbs Recipe\nHow to Prepare Green Spring Produce\nAre the Rules of Big-Pot Blanching True?\nAll About Labaneh\nHomemade Labaneh (Labneh) Recipe\nGluten-free Salads\nVegetarian Salads\nFava Beans\nMozzarella\nGreek Yogurt"
