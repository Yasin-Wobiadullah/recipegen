Toss the eggplant with the salt in a large colander, and allow to sit and drain in the sink for 30 minutes.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and pepper. Without rinsing the eggplant, toss them with the vinaigrette, and let marinate for 15 minutes.\nPreheat the boiler. Arrange the slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet (you may need to do this in batches). Broil until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Flip the eggplant slices over with a spatula and brown the other side. (The time will vary depending on the strength of your broiler.)\nHeat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Place 2 tablespoons of marinara sauce in the bottom of each of 4 small au gratin dishes. Divide the eggplant slices among the 4 dishes. Top each dish with 1/4 cup of marinara sauce. Then divide the mozzarella pieces among the 4 dishes, and finally the Parmigiano Reggiano. Place the gratin dishes on a rimmed baking sheet to catch any spills, and bake for 30 minutes until the marinara sauce is bubbling, and the cheese is melted. Let the tians rest for 10 minutes. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of pesto per tian, and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\ncolander\n,\nwhisk\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n, four small au gratin dishes\nRead More\nProven\u00e7al Tian (Eggplant, Zucchini, Squash, and Tomato Casserole) Recipe\nAll-American Eggplant Parmesan Recipe\nMelanzane alla Parmigiana (Italian-Style Eggplant Parmesan) Recipe\nFrench\nVegetarian Mains\nSavory\nMozzarella\nEggplant",
