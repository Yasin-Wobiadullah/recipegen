  "full_text": "How to Make the Fluffiest Arroz Rojo (Mexican Red Rice)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nResting Time\n10 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\n(\n210\ng\n) long-grain\nwhite rice\n2\ntablespoons\n(\n30\nml\n)\nvegetable oil,\ndivided\n1/2\nmedium\nyellow\nor\nwhite onion\n(\n4\nounces\n;\n113\ng\n), chopped\n1\nmedium\ngarlic\nclove\n, chopped\n1 1/2\ncups\n(\n360\nml\n)\nhomemade chicken stock\nor store-bought\nlow-sodium chicken broth\n, divided\n2\nplum\nor\nRoma tomatoes\n(about\n8\nounces\n;\n225\ng\n), chopped\n1\ntablespoon\nkosher salt\n1\nmedium\ncarrot\n(\n115\ng\n), peeled if desired and cut into \u00bc-inch pieces (about\n1/2\ncup\n); see note\n1/2\ncup\nfrozen peas\n(\n70\ng\n), thawed\n1\nserrano chile\nFresh cilantro leaves\nfor garnish, optional\nDirections\nIn a large bowl, rinse rice in plenty of water, swishing the rice around with your fingers to wash off as much starch as possible. Drain well in a fine-mesh strainer, then spread on a paper-towel lined plate or clean kitchen towel to dry for at least 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nIn a 2- or 3-quart saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer mixture to a blender, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible. Add 1/4 cup (60ml) broth, tomatoes, and salt to the blender. Pulse to combine, then blend until completely smooth; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nIn the saucepan with the reserved oil, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is golden and smells toasted, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour in the tomato mixture, stir to combine, and simmer until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nAdd remaining 1 1/4 cups (290ml) broth and mix gently, taking care not to agitate the rice more than necessary. Stab the serrano chile once or twice with a fork to help release its flavor, then add it to the broth. Scatter the peas and carrots over the rice.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nBring to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until liquid is no longer visible on surface of rice, minimal steam is being generated, and rice has a noticeable \u201ccooked\u201d smell, 12 to 18 minutes. (You can open the lid a little at the 12-minute mark to check the rice\u2019s progress, but try not to let too much steam out.)\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nTurn off heat and let rice sit, covered, for at least 10 or up to 20 minutes to absorb any remaining liquid. Fluff the rice with a fork and gently stir the peas and carrots throughout the rice, discard chile if desired, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\n2-to 3-quart\nsaucepan\nwith lid,\ncolander\n,\nblender\nNotes\nCarrot skins will oxidize slightly and darken while cooking so if you want picture-perfect orange pieces, peel your carrots.\nShrimp Variation\nFor a one-pan meal, substitute shrimp broth for chicken broth and add 150g chopped fresh shrimp at the same time as the peas and carrots. Cover and cook as usual. Serves 2 or 3 as a main course.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis recipe is at its most flavorful fresh from the pot, but also keeps well refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. To reheat, stir in tablespoon of chicken stock or water and microwave until hot.\nWhite Rice\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nMexican",
