Remove from heat and transfer all spices except cinnamon stick to a spice infuser bag, tea ball, or cheesecloth sachet.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nReturn spice bag to saucepan with cinnamon stick and add wine along with orange juice and reserved hulls. Bring to a bare simmer, then cover and hold at a very bare simmer until wine is deeply infused with spice and orange flavor, at least 1 and up to 2 hours. (Alternatively, transfer wine, spices, and orange juice and hulls to a slow cooker, cover, and hold at low heat for 2 hours.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd maple syrup and brandy, then taste and adjust flavor with additional syrup and extra alcohol if desired. Cover and steep for another 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nThe spices can be adjusted to fit your tastes or what you have available in your spice cabinet; at the very least, a cinnamon stick, some whole cloves, and a bit of nutmeg can do.\nFeel free to sweeten the mulled wine with whatever sweetener you have on hand: plain sugar will work fine, as will brown or demerara sugar.\nAn aged brandy like Armagnac or Cognac can be good, or a fruit brandy such as plum or apricot. In a pinch, a splash of rum or bourbon will also do the trick.\nSpecial equipment\nSmall saucepan, electric slow cooker (optional)\nWinter Drinks\nChristmas\nDrinks",
