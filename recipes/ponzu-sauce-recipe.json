Bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and stir in katsuobushi. Cover and let steep for 10 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and discard solids (or reserve to make a second batch, using some additional katsuobushi in the second batch). Allow liquid to cool completely.\nCombine steeped mirin, citrus juice, and soy sauce. Ponzu will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nMirin, kombu, and\nkatsuobushi\n(bonito) can be found in any Japanese grocery or most well-stocked supermarkets. Fresh yuzu is nearly impossible to find outside of Japan. Bottled yuzu juice works well, but can be pricey. You can cut the bottled yuzu juice with lemon and lime juice to lower the cost, or simply replace it completely with a lemon/lime combination.\nDipping Sauce\nJapanese",
