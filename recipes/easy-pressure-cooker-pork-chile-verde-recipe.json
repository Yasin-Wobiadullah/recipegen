Heat over high heat until gently sizzling, then seal pressure cooker, bring to high pressure, and cook for 30 minutes. Release pressure.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nUsing tongs, transfer pork pieces to a bowl and set aside. Add cilantro and fish sauce to remaining contents in pressure cooker. Blend with an immersion blender or in a countertop blender, then season to taste with salt. Return pork to sauce and stir gently to combine. Serve immediately with tortillas and lime wedges.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric or stovetop pressure cooker\n,\ncountertop blender\nor\nimmersion blender\n,\nmortar and pestle\nor\nspice grinder\nNotes\nYou can use other fresh green chiles in place of Anaheims, poblanos, and serranos. Using 100% Hatch chiles is a good way to go. You can also replace the fresh chiles with frozen or jarred roasted green chiles, using the same amount by weight.\nToast cumin in a dry skillet\nand grind with a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle for the most flavor. If there's one thing you can do to improve the flavor of any dish that includes dry spices, it's to use whole spices and grind them with a mortar and pestle. The difference it makes in side-by-side tests is astonishing, and cleaning a mortar and pestle is easier than cleaning an electric spice grinder.\nChili\nPressure Cooker\nPressure Cooked Stews\nPork Shoulder"
