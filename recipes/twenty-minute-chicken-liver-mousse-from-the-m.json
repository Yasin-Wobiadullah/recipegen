Season with salt and pepper and cook until the onions are caramelized and brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer.\nAdd 1 sprig each of the thyme, oregano, and rosemary and smash them in with the onions. Deglaze your pan with the port, using a wooden spoon to scrape up the good bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl, pulling out the herbs and discarding them, and let cool.\nWipe out your pan with a paper towel and place over medium-high heat. Add your livers and saut\u00e9 until browned on both sides but still medium-rare, about 2 minutes on each side. Add the remaining herb sprigs and deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping up the bits on the bottom of the pan. Cook just until all the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes; don\u2019t let the livers start to stick to the bottom of the pan. Transfer the livers to a plate or bowl to cool, discarding the herbs.\nToss the cooled livers and onion into a blender (a food processor will also work, but a blender will yield a smoother texture) and turn it on. After the livers have been spinning for about a minute, slowly add the cream and cream cheese and blend to a puree. Taste for seasoning. The mousse should be slightly salty; if it\u2019s not, add more salt 1/2 teaspoon at a time. You can add more black pepper too, if you wish.\nPass the blended livers through a fine sieve and pour the mousse into the mold(s) of your choice and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. The mousse will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 week.\nSpecial equipment\nMason jars, ramekins, or a terrine mold (you\u2019ll have 21/2 to 3 cups of mousse you\u2019ll need to pour into a good-looking vessel or vessels of some sort)\nPat\u00e9s & Rillettes\nChicken",
