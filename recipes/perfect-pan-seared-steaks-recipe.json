Season liberally with salt. Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 40 minutes and up to 2 hours. Alternatively, place on a plate or on a rack over a baking sheet in the refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator at least 40 minutes before cooking.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nIn a large stainless-steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over high heat until heavily smoking. Season steaks with pepper, add to pan, and cook, flipping frequently with tongs until well browned on all sides (including edges, which you can sear by holding steaks sideways with tongs) and the internal temperature has reached 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) for rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium (steak will continue to cook for a bit afterward), 6 to 12 minutes depending on thickness.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nAdd butter and optional aromatics to pan and continue to cook, flipping often, for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from pan and let rest in a warm place for at least 5 minutes before serving.\nSerious Eats / Diana Chistruga\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nstainless steel skillet\nor\ncast iron skillet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nwire rack and rimmed baking sheet\n(optional)\nNotes\nAn equivalent weight of porterhouse, T-bone, tenderloin, or strip steak can be used in place of ribeye steak. Try to get steaks at least one and a half inches thick. It's better to cook a bigger steak and portion it after cooking than to try to cook thinner steaks.\nRead More\n7 Myths About Cooking Steak That Need to Go Away\nFour Expensive Steak Cuts to Know\nRibeyes\nStovetop Beef\nBeef Mains"
