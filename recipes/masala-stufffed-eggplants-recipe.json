The stem should still hold the entire vegetable together. In a small mixing bowl, combine red chilli powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, amchoor powder (dried mango powder), and 1 tablespoon oil into a paste. Season to taste with salt.\nGently open each eggplant, spoon 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of the paste (depending on the size of the eggplant) into each and spread with your fingers until it lightly coats the inside. Heat remaining oil in large heavy bottomed saucepan on high heat until shimmering. Carefully slide eggplants into oil. Stand back while doing this. Wait 20 seconds until one side is lightly fried. Gently turn each eggplant over to lightly fry the other side. Wait 20 seconds. Turn heat down to medium and cover. Allow to cook until completely tender, about 12 minutes total, opening once to turn eggplants over. Remove from heat, drain excess oil on a paper towel, and season with salt to taste. Serve hot with rotis (Indian bread) or with white rice and daal (lentil soup).\nSpecial equipment\n12-inch heavy-bottomed (lidded) saucepan, 1 small mixing bowl.\nIndian\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop Vegetables\nEggplant\nQuick Sides",
