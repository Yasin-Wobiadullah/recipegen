Slowly whisk in sugar. If mixture is too dry, whisk in 1 or 2 tablespoons of cream to make a smooth paste.\nOnce the yolk paste is smooth and all the sugar is incorporated, whisk in remaining cream and milk. Put pan over medium heat and cook, whisking frequently, until a custard thickly coats the back of a spoon, but a swiped finger leaves a clean line. Strain into an airtight container, stir in vanilla and salt, and chill in refrigerator overnight.\nThe next day, churn in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer ice cream to a container capable of holding 2 quarts or larger, and quickly stir in nuts, chocolates, and marshmallows with a rubber spatula until thoroughly mixed in. Chill in freezer for at least 3 hours before serving.\nNotes\nRoasting raw nuts yourself yields especially flavorful results. To roast, arrange nuts in a single layer on a sheet pan and bake on the middle rack of an oven set to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Roast until darker in color and aromatic, about 10 to 12 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, then cool completely. Cover warm hazelnuts in a kitchen towel for 1 minute, then rub with towel to loosen skins.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nGluten-free Desserts\nChocolate\nHeavy Cream\nAlmonds\nHazelnuts",
