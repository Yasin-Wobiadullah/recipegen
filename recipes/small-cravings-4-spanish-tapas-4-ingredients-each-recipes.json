Rub eggplant, onion halves, and bell peppers with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Place on foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and roast for 30 to 40 minutes until eggplant and peppers are fully softened and charred on the exterior, and onions are softened with a few charred spots, turning vegetables every ten minutes to achieve even cooking. Some vegetables may cook faster than others - remove them to large mixing bowl as they finish roasting.\nAllow vegetables to rest until cool enough to handle, then peel eggplant and pepper (skins should slip off fairly easily with fingers). Roughly chop all vegetables into strips and return to mixing bowl. Add sherry vinegar and remaining olive oil and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature with grilled or toasted rustic bread.\nTo Make Queso Idaz\u00e1bal Marinado:\nAdd all ingredients to medium bowl and mix with rubber spatula or wooden spoon to combine. Cover with plastic and let marinate at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours, mixing occasionally. Serve at room temperature with toothpicks and crusty bread for dipping into olive oil.\nTo Make Garbanzos con Chorizo:\nHeat olive oil in 10-inch heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add chorizo and cook, stirring frequently until some fat render and sausage is starting to brown, about 10 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until onion is fully softened but not browning, 5-8 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste begins to fry, about 2 minutes. Add chickpeas, stir to combine, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and reduce until stew-like consistency is reached, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve immediately with toasted or grilled rustic bread.\nTo Make Coliflor con Piment\u00f3n:\nHeat olive oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add sliced garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is light golden brown. Using slotted spoon or skimmer, remove garlic to small bowl and set aside. Add cauliflower to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally until fully tender and caramelized in spots. Remove from heat, add 1/2 teaspoon paprika, reserved garlic, and sherry vinegar (oil may spatter when adding vinegar\u2014be careful). Stir to combine, season to taste with salt and pepper, transfer to wide serving dish, and sprinkle with remaining paprika. Serve with toasted or grilled rustic bread.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nSpanish",
