  "full_text": "Breakfast Black Rice Porridge With Coconut Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\nThai black (purple)\u00a0rice\n2\ncups\nroom temperature\nwater\n(more if needed, up to 4 cups)\nGranulated sugar\n(or shaved palm sugar), to taste\n1/2\ncup\ncoconut cream\n(the thick part that rises to the top of canned unsweetened coconut milk)\nSalt\n, to taste\nAssorted\nfresh fruits\n, nuts, and seeds of your choice\nDirections\nIn a 2-quart saucepan, bring the rice and water to a boil; lower the heat so the mixture no longer boils so vigorously. Continue to cook the rice, covered, until the water is almost entirely absorbed. The amount of time this takes depends on the age of your rice.\nOnce most of the water is absorbed, check to see if the rice kernels have split and softened and the overall consistency has become like runny oatmeal. If not, add more water, one cup at a time, and bring the mixture back to a boil then lower the heat and simmer, covered.\nContinue to check for doneness and add more water along the way as necessary. You shouldn't need more 4 cups of water, and the rice shouldn't take longer than 45 minutes to soften and gelatinize.\nOnce the grains have split and released some starch, turn off the heat. Let the rice kernels continue to swell as they cool in the covered pot.\nAfter the rice has cooled down somewhat, you'll see that there's no liquid left in the pot and the rice has become soft (though it's not going to be entirely soft and smooth as we're dealing with whole grain here) and gooey.\nYour black rice porridge is now ready to be sweetened and salted.\nTo serve, spoon the rice porridge into a serving bowl, top with the coconut cream, fresh fruits, nuts and/or seeds.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMy Thai: Breakfast Black Rice Porridge with Coconut Cream\nThai\nDairy-free Breakfast & Brunch\nVegan Breakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nCoconut Milk & Cream"
