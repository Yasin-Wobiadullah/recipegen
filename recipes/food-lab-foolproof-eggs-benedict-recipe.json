Place 1 ham slice on each English muffin half and top with one drained egg. Season eggs with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpoon warm hollandaise over each egg. Sprinkle with parsley or chives (if using) and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nNotes\nPoached eggs can be stored in a bowl of warm water until ready to place on English muffins. They can also be cooked up to three days ahead, stored in a bowl of water in the refrigerator. To reheat, add the eggs to a bowl of hot tap water and let them sit for at least 15 minutes.\nHollandaise should be made just before cooking ham and toasting English muffins. It can be kept warm in a covered pot on a warm spot of the stove. Do not reheat directly over a flame or it will curdle and break.\nPoached Eggs\nBreakfast & Brunch\nEaster\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
