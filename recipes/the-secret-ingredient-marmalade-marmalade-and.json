Melt the clarified butter in a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat. Fry the bread, 3 pieces at a time, 1 minute one each side, until crisp and golden. Remove to a plate, and repeat with the remaining bread, adding more butter as needed.\nAnother less traditional, if more sensible, way to prepare the bread is to preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Brush both sides of 9 thin slices of baguette with flavorless oil or melted clarified butter, and arrange in a single layer on a small rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crisp and golden, about 10 to 12 minutes.\nSpread each toast with 1/2 teaspoon marmalade, and top with 1 rectangle of Epoisses. Set on a platter, and serve.\nYou can also make this as a grilled cheese, but using 2 1/2-inch slices of farmhouse bread per person. Spread the outside of the bread with room temperature unsalted butter, and the inside with 1 tablespoon orange marmalade. Spread 2 ounces of Epoisses between the slices, and stick together. Toast in a skillet on medium-low heat for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the outside is golden and the inside is absolutely runny. Repeat for as many sandwiches as you need.\nSandwiches\nCheese",
