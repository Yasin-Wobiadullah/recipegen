Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer. Cook until potatoes are completely tender and offer little resistance when pierced with a paring knife, about 15 minutes. Strain potatoes and let drain, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to medium mixing bowl and set aside.\nVicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, combine breadcrumbs, potato starch, chaat masala, garam masala, Kashmiri chile powder, turmeric, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt in a small mixing bowl. Using a fork or small whisk, stir until thoroughly combined.\nVicky Wasik\nSprinkle spiced breadcrumb mixture and ginger evenly over still-hot drained potatoes in bowl. Using a potato masher or fork, mash potatoes roughly, breaking up any large pieces; do not overmash, as you want some smaller unmashed potato bits in the final mix. Add cilantro and chile and, using a spoon, stir potato mixture gently to distribute seasoning evenly; the mixture should be above 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) after mixing.\nVicky Wasik\nUsing clean hands, roll 3 tablespoons potato mixture into a ball between your palms, packing the mixture together much as you would a snowball. Flatten ball between the palms of your hands to form a puck, making sure that there are no cracks around the edges (if cracks are present, smooth edges with your fingers). Repeat with remaining potato mixture; you should have 15 potato patties. Let patties cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. (Patties can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours; refrigerating can cause the texture to become mealy).\nVicky Wasik\nSet a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and line with paper towels.\u00a0In a 10-inch cast iron skillet, heat 1 cup oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add 8 potato patties and cook, swirling occasionally, until golden brown on bottom, about 2 minutes. Using an offset or thin metal spatula, flip patties and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until golden brown on second side, about 2 minutes. Transfer patties to prepared wire rack.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet and repeat frying with remaining potato patties. Allow patties to cool slightly before serving, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer potatoes patties to a serving platter and serve with mint and tamarind chutney alongside.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nPotato masher, 10-inch\ncast iron skillet\n, rimmed baking sheet, wire rack, slotted spatula\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nAloo tikki are best enjoyed immediately. Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week; rewarm in a microwave or skillet before serving.\nPotatoes\nIndian\nThe Latest",
