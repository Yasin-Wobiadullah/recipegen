Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C).\nIn a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and sugar until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Whisk in vanilla. Use a wooden spoon to stir in dry ingredients until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips and almonds.\nUsing well floured hands (dough will be sticky) divide dough into two equal pieces. Form each into a 2-inch wide log and place on baking sheet. Bake until just starting to turn golden at the edges, 30 minutes.\nCarefully transfer logs to a cutting board and let cool 10 minutes. Use a serrated knife to cut logs into 1-inch cookies. Place cookies, cut side up, on the baking sheet. Bake until just lightly toasted, another 20 minutes. Let cool completely.\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk\n,\nmixing bowls\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n, parchment paper,\nserrated knife\nNotes\nI used the cinnamon coated almonds from Trader Joe's. If you can only find regular candied almonds, add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the dough with the dry ingredients.\nCookies\nAlmonds",
