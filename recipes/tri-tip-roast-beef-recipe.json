Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, at least overnight and up to 2 nights.\nWhen Ready to Cook:\nAdjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 225\u00b0F (105\u00b0C). Place baking sheet with rack and tri-tip in oven and roast until internal temperature registers 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) on an\ninstant-read thermometer\nat the tri-tip's thickest point, about 1 1/2 hours.\nMeanwhile, in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine stock and 1 cup (240ml) red wine over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, occasionally scraping down sides of saucier with a rubber spatula, until mixture thickens slightly and is reduced to 2 cups (475ml), 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off heat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nJust before tri-tip comes out of the oven, add oil to a 12-inch cast iron, carbon steel, or heavy stainless steel skillet and heat over high heat until smoking. Add tri-tip to skillet and cook, using a small cast iron skillet or weight to press down on tri-tip for even browning. If the beef begins to char or the skillet begins smoking aggressively, reduce heat to medium-high. Cook until tri-tip is evenly browned on all sides and internal temperature registers 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C), about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer tri-tip to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add shallots to now-empty skillet, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are softened and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) red wine to skillet and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer shallot mixture to saucier with reduced stock and red wine mixture and stir to combine. Bring jus to a simmer over high heat and stir in soy sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nCut and remove twine from tri-tip, then cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick slices if you are serving the beef as a main course. Slice into thin, 2-inch-wide pieces if you plan to serve the beef in sandwiches. Serve right away, passing shallot jus at the table.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nButcher's twine,\nrimmed baking sheet\n, wire rack, instant-read thermometer,\n3-quart stainless steel saucie\nr, large stainless steel skillet or\ncast iron skillet\nNotes\nFor best results, season and trim the roast and allow it to rest at least overnight, uncovered, in the refrigerator to improve seasoning, browning, and texture. Homemade stock will make a better jus, but you can also use high-quality store-bought stock. Because the stock is reduced for the jus, try to purchase low-sodium stock; otherwise, you risk making the jus overly salty.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis recipe is best enjoyed right away.\nTri Tips\nBritish\nRoasted Beef\nBeef Mains\nChristmas Dinners"
