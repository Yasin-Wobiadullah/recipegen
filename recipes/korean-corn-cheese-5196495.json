Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a 12-inch cast iron skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add doenjang and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and translucent, 5 to 6 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd corn and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until corn is tender and liquid released from onion and corn has mostly evaporated, 6 to 8 minute\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSprinkle shredded mozzarella evenly over corn. Transfer skillet to oven, and broil until cheese is fully melted and lightly browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Transfer skillet to a heatproof surface. Drizzle mustard sauce over top, sprinkle with scallions and sea salt (if using), and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch\ncast iron skillet\nNotes\nThis recipe works equally well with fresh, frozen, and canned corn. Fresh, in-season corn is sweeter than frozen or canned, so add a touch of sugar if you use frozen or canned corn. If making with frozen corn, use 28 ounces (800g) corn kernels, combined with 2 teaspoons (10g) sugar. If using canned corn, use three 15.25-ounce (480g) cans of corn, drained, combined with 2 teaspoons (10g) sugar. Follow recipe instructions as written.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nKansas City-Style Cheesy Corn Recipe\nCreamy Corn Dip With Feta, Mint, and Tomatoes Recipe\nKorean-Style Fire Chicken (Buldak) With Cheese Recipe\nCrispy Kimchi Pancakes With Shrimp Recipe\nKorean\nVegetable Sides\nMozzarella\nCorn\nVegetarian Sides"
