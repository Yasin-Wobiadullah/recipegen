Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel\u2013lined plate; reserve drippings.\nSerious Eats / Robbie Lozano\nIn a medium bowl, stir together mayonnaise, sour cream, pickle brine, dill, chives, garlic, and black pepper. Fold in cooked bacon and 1 1/2 teaspoons of reserved drippings. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Wipe skillet clean.\nSerious Eats / Robbie Lozano\nArrange drained pickle slices on a large paper towel\u2013lined plate; pat dry. In a wide, shallow bowl, combine buttermilk and black pepper. Add pickles, stirring to evenly coat with buttermilk mixture.\nSerious Eats / Robbie Lozano\nLine a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment or wax paper; set aside. In another wide, shallow bowl, whisk cornmeal, flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, and salt to combine. Working with several pickle slices at a time, toss to evenly coat pickle slices with cornmeal mixture. Place dredged pickles on prepared lined baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Robbie Lozano\nLine another 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with paper towels; set aside. Fill the same cast iron skillet with 3/4-inch of oil and heat over medium-high until oil registers 375\u00baF (190\u00baC) on an instant-read thermometer. Working in batches of about 8, carefully add pickles, sliding them in from as close to the oil\u2019s surface as possible to minimize splashing. Fry pickles, using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon to turn them occasionally, until golden brown and crisp about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Season with salt and serve with bacon ranch.\nSerious Eats / Robbie Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet, two 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheets, instant-read thermometer, spider skimmer or slotted spoon\nNotes\nIf your preferred brand of pickles isn't sold in slices, you can slice whole pickles into 1/4-inch-thick rounds.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBacon-ranch can be prepared up to 1 week ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nPickles can be breaded and frozen for up to 3 months: Prepare through step 4, and after breading and arranging on a parchment- or wax paper\u2013lined baking sheet, freeze until firm, then transfer to a zip-top bag or airtight container. Cook from frozen according to the recipe directions, adding up to 2 minutes if necessary.\nFried pickles are best eaten immediately but leftovers may be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. To reheat in an air fryer: Place on air fryer rack and reheat at 350\u00baF (175\u00baC) until warmed through. To reheat in the oven: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00baF (190\u00baC). Place fried pickles on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and reheat until warmed through, about 6 minutes.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nThe Latest\nFrying"
