  "full_text": "Fast and Easy Cream Cheese Frosting Recipe\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nActive\n8 mins\nTotal\n10 mins\nServes\n16 servings\nMakes\n2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3 1/2\nounces\nsugar\n(about\n1/2\ncup\n;\n100\ng\n); see note\n5\nounces\nheavy cream\n(shy\n2/3\ncup\n;\n140\ng\n)\n1\nteaspoon\n(\n5\ng\n)\nvanilla extract\n1/8\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for\ntable salt\n, use about half as much by volume\n8\nounces\nplain, full-fat Philadelphia cream cheese\n, cold (\none\n8-ounce brick\n;\n225\ng\n)\nDirections\nWith kitchen temperatures above 74\u00b0F (23\u00b0C), start by refrigerating the mixing bowl and sugar until they have cooled to 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). At elevated temperatures, these ingredients and equipment can act as a heat source to the cream, preventing full aeration.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or using a hand mixer, combine sugar, cream, vanilla, and salt. Mix at medium-low speed until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to high and continue beating until cream is about as thick as Greek yogurt, about 2 minutes longer. Begin adding cream cheese 2 tablespoons at a time; this should take about 30 seconds all together. Once it is incorporated, shut off the mixer. The frosting will look a bit curdled, like cottage cheese; this is the result of incomplete mixing rather than over-whipping, so don\u2019t be alarmed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nThoroughly scrape bowl and whisk, then continue whipping on high until frosting is smooth and light, with only a few small flecks of cream cheese (they will disappear into the frosting over time). This may take 2 to 3 minutes with a stand mixer, or more if using a hand mixer. After whipping, the frosting should be about 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C). Use immediately or refrigerate until needed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nHand mixer\nor\nstand mixer\n,\nflexible spatula\nNotes\nIf room temperature climbs above 74\u00b0F (23\u00b0C) in your kitchen, refrigerate the mixing bowl and beater, along with the sugar, until it's cooled to about 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) before whipping the cream; otherwise, the warm bowl and sugar may inhibit aeration.\nIt seems that due to variations in the formula, not all brands of cream cheese perform equally well in this recipe. For best results, use Philadelphia cream cheese.\nRead More\nA Guide to Cake Frosting\nBlackberry Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting\nDouble-Strawberry Cake\nGingerbread Sheet Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting\nOne-Bowl, Overnight Cinnamon Rolls\nDesserts\nCakes"
