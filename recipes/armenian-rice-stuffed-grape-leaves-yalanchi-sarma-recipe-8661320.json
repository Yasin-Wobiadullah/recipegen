Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until pan begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until onions are fully softened and beginning to stick to bottom of pot, 6 to 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nAdd tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until oil turns red, about 2 minutes. Add rice, 1 cup water, 1/2 cup lemon juice, and currants, if using. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer rice, stirring occasionally, until grains are al dente and most of the liquid is absorbed, about 17 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nTransfer rice mixture to a medium bowl. Using a flexible spatula, fold in parsley and pine nuts, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow rice mixture to cool to warm room temperature, about 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nMeanwhile, fill a large bowl with warm tap water and set aside. Remove grape leaves from jar; they should measure 4 1/2 to 5 inches in diameter. (If leaf is larger than 6 inches in diameter, use a paring knife to trim excess.) Transfer leaves to bowl of water. Gently swish leaves to separate them from one another and gently rinse them under running water. Transfer 22 intact grape leaves, each about 4 1/2 to 5 inches in diameter, to the basket of a salad spinner one at a time, laying them evenly around and over the bottom. Using a salad spinner, gently spin leaves dry and transfer to a plate. Repeat rinsing, draining, and drying leaves until you have 59 leaves in total. (You\u2019ll need 44 perfect leaves for the sarma, and 15 additional leaves for covering them once they\u2019re in the dish.)\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nAdjust oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00baF (190\u00baC).\nTo Roll Grape Leaves:\nPlace one grape leaf rib side up with the stem end facing you on a cutting board. Using a paring knife, remove woody remnants of stem, if present, taking care not to cut into the leaf itself. Place a slightly rounded, packed tablespoon (20g) of filling in the center of leaf just above the stem end, and, using a spoon, gently shape filling into a rough log about 2 inches long and 1/2-inch wide. Fold sides of leaf over the filling one at a time. Starting with the end closest to you, roll leaf away from you until log is fully enclosed, gently compressing it as you do. Use a paring knife or scissors to trim any overhanging bit of leaf from sides. Transfer to short end of a 10- by 8-inch baking dish or cake pan, seam-side-down.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nStir filling to reincorporate any oil that has separated. Repeat trimming, filling, and rolling until rice mixture is finished, arranging sarma in 3 rows along the length of the pan. (It\u2019s fine to gently compress logs to make all of them fit into a single layer; you should have 12 to 14 sarma per row.)\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nPour any remaining oil from the filling, remaining 1 cup water, 1/2 cup oil, and remaining 1/4 cup lemon juice over sarma. Lay 12 to 15 grape leaves over sarma to cover completely, pushing them down around edges of pan. Cover pan tightly with foil, then transfer to oven and bake until all but a few tablespoons of liquid remain in bottom of pan; this should take about 60 minutes, but if there are more than a few tablespoons of liquid remaining at that point, re-cover with foil and return to oven for 15 minutes before checking again.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nTransfer pan to a wire rack. Carefully loosen one corner of foil, then, using tongs, carefully peel back foil to release steam. Remove foil completely, then use it to\u00a0loosely cover pan. Allow sarma to cool to room temperature, about 90 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nRemove grape leaves from top of sarma and discard. Using an offset spatula, gently transfer sarma to a platter in even layer. Drizzle with any remaining liquid in pan and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nSpecial Equipment\n8- to 10-quart Dutch oven, salad spinner. 10- by 8-inch cake pan or baking dish, aluminum foil\nNotes\nIf you\u2019d like to speed things up, you can use a food processor to finely chop the onion: Cut the onion into 2-inch chunks. Using a food processor, pulse onion until finely chopped, about 15 pulses. Do not overmix.\nIf using double-concentrated tomato paste, use 3 tablespoons (45g) instead of 6 tablespoons (90g).\nCurrants add a bit of sweetness to the filling, but they are not always used, and are optional.\nIf you do not have a salad spinner, let the grape leaves drain in a colander for 15 minutes, then lay on a kitchen towel and roll up to dry them.\nAvoid using an uncoated aluminum baking pan to bake the sarma, as the acidity can discolor it; glass, stainless, or nonstick are acceptable.\nThough yalanchi sarma can be served the day they are made, their flavor and texture are best after they\u2019ve been refrigerated for at least 24 hours.\u00a0Allow yalanchi sarma to come to room temperature before serving.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYalanchi sarma can be made 5 days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container. Allow yalanchi sarma to warm to room temperature, about 30 minutes, before plating and serving.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nThe Latest\nWhite Rice\nMiddle Eastern\nArmenian"
