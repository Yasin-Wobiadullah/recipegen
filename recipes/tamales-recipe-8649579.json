Make sure they are fully submerged by weighing them down with a heavy plate, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nMeanwhile, in a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, beat the lard (or other listed fat if using) on medium speed until smooth, light and airy, about 4 minutes. (See notes.)\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nStop mixer, use a spatula to scrape down sides of mixer bowl, and add masa harina and baking powder. Start mixer and gradually increase speed to medium and mix until well combined, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nWith mixer running, slowly drizzle in broth or water, until well combined and dough forms, about 5 minutes. Dough should be moist, smooth, and spongy in texture.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nTo test dough for seasoning, flatten a small piece of dough between your fingers, then microwave on high power until cooked through, about for 15 seconds. Taste and add salt by returning to stand mixer or kneading in by hand, if needed.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nRemove husks from water and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel. Working with 1 husk at a time, lay flat on work surface, cupped side up. Using a small offset spatula, back of spoon, or bench scraper, spread about 2 tablespoons (32g) of the prepared masa into a thin layer across the center of the wrapper, leaving a 1-inch border from the wide open end of the wrapper and from both sides, and leaving the bottom 2-inches of the narrow tail end empty. You should have a roughly 4-inch by 4-inch flat square of dough (see notes). If necessary, remove any excess masa using a small offset spatula or butter knife.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpread 2 tablespoons of your preferred filling down the center of the dough in a vertical line running the direction of the tapered tail to the open top.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nWith the corn husk\u2019s tapered tail end facing you, fold 1 long side of the corn husk over the filling, stopping and pressing in the middle. Fold the other long side of the husk over the filling, meeting the other folded husk in the middle. Make sure both folded husk edges overlap slightly for a secure closure. Tuck the unfilled tapered tail up to create a secure pouch with 1 open end. Repeat with remaining corn husks, masa, and filling.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nFit large pot or Dutch oven with steamer basket, removing feet from steamer basket if pot is short. Fill pot with water until it just touches bottom of basket and bring to a boil. Gently stand tamales in the basket with open ends facing up and seam sides facing out. Cover and steam, checking water level and adding additional water as needed, until tamales easily separate from husks, 60 to 90 minutes. Rest in the steamer basket, uncovered and off heat until fully firm, 20 minutes. Transfer to a platter, carefully open and serve.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer with paddle attachment, kitchen scale, steamer basket, large pot or large Dutch oven\nNotes\nMasa harina is available in the Latin foods aisle at most grocery stores. I like to use Maseca and Masienda brands. Maseca is more widely available, while Masienda usually needs to be ordered online. I tested this recipe with both brands and found they were interchangeable in the recipe when measured by weight.\nIt\u2019s easiest to use large corn husks that measure about 8 inches long by 6 inches wide at the open end; if the husks are small, you may need to use two per tamal by shingling them as needed to hold all of the filling. If you do use corn husks that are different from this recommended size, you may need to adjust the amount of masa needed and the dimensions for each tamal. The most important thing for proper shaping is to be sure to spread the masa into a very thin layer.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nUncooked assembled tamales can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. When cooking frozen tamales, steam them for an additional 15 minutes.\nCooked tamales can be refrigerated for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 6 months. Refrigerated tamales can be reheated in the corn husks by steaming, microwaving, or grilling. Frozen tamales should not be thawed before steaming.\nMexican\nThe Latest\nTechniques\nCornmeal\nChristmas"
