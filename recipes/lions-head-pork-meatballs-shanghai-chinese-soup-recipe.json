Using a fork, mash tofu into fine pieces.

Refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nWorking with wet hands, form small handfuls of meatball mixture into balls; you should have about 5 to 6 meatballs.\nHeat 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat in a non-stick pan.

Arrange meatballs in the pot in a single layer, pour chicken broth mixture in, and bring to a simmer. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until meatballs are cooked through, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, soak vermicelli noodles in warm water until softened, about 5 minutes.

Cover and simmer for 10 minutes longer.\nTo serve, bring pot to the table or carefully transfer everything to a large serving bowl.
