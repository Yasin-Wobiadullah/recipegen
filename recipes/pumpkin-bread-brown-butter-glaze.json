Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, malted milk powder, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, baking soda, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger until well combined.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large bowl, whisk together eggs, pumpkin/squash pur\u00e9e, oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, milk, and vanilla until thoroughly combined and sugars are dissolved, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd flour mixture to egg mixture. Whisk just until incorporated and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing a flexible spatula, scrape batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake until loaf is domed and golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out with few moist crumbs attached, or to an internal temperature of around 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C), about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer pan to a wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet to cool for 30 minutes. Run a butter knife along edges to loosen, then lift loaf using overhanging parchment. Remove parchment and return loaf to wire rack.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, for the Glaze:\nIn a heatproof small bowl, combine powdered sugar, salt, and cinnamon.\nIn a 1-quart stainless steel saucier, melt butter over medium-low heat. Increase heat to medium and simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops. Continue cooking and stirring until foaming subsides, scraping up brown bits that form on bottom, and butter is golden yellow and milk solids are chestnut brown in color, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd milk, vanilla, and butter, along with all the brown bits, to powdered sugar mixture and whisk until smooth. You should have 3 ounces (about 1/3 cup; 80g) of glaze.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSlowly drizzle glaze evenly over top of pumpkin bread, letting it drip down sides. Allow glaze to set for 10 minutes, then slice bread with serrated knife and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan,\nwire rack\n, rimmed baking sheet, 1-quart stainless steel saucier\nNotes\nRoasting butternut squash deepens its natural butterscotch-like flavor and sweetness. To make butternut squash pur\u00e9e, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C). Split one small squash (about 2 pounds) in half lengthwise, remove seeds, and place cut-side down on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Roast until tender when pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. When cool, scrape pulp into a food processor (discarding skins) and pur\u00e9e until smooth. The pur\u00e9e can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nWrapped tightly in foil or plastic, pumpkin bread will keep for up to 3 days at room temperature.\nQuick Breads\nPumpkin\nFall\nWinter Breakfast & Brunch",
