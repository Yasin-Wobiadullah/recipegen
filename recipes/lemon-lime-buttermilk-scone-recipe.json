Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Place flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and butter in large bowl. Using a pastry cutter, cut butter into flour until much of the butter is the size of very small peas.\nAdd lime zest, egg, and buttermilk to the dry ingredients. Stir with a spoon, and then hands until mixture forms a dough (it may feel dry at first but will come together.)\nPlace dough onto a lightly floured board and pat into a 7-inch disc. Cut into 6 wedges and evenly space on pan. Bake until set and edges are golden, 18 to 22 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool.\nNotes\nA heavy duty handheld pastry cutter (or dough blender) with blades makes easy work of cutting the butter into the flour. I like OXO brand dough blender, available in kitchen stores and online.\nSpecial equipment\nPastry cutter\nThis Recipe Appears In\nOne Bowl Baking: Easy Lime Buttermilk Scones\nScones\nPastries\nLime\nButtermilk"
