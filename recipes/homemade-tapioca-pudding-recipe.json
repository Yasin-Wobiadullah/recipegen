  "full_text": "Homemade Tapioca Pudding Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nActive\n45 mins\nSoaking and Chilling Time\n14 hrs\nTotal\n14 hrs 40 mins\nServes\n6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\nmedium pearl tapioca\n(do not use instant varieties)\n4\ncups\nwhole milk\n1\ntablespoon\npure\u00a0vanilla extract\n1\ncup\nsugar\n, divided\n1/2\nteaspoon\nsalt\n1\negg\n3\negg yolks\nDirections\nPlace the tapioca in a large bowl with a quart of cold water. Cover and allow the tapioca to soak for at least 12 hours. When ready to use, use a fine-mesh strainer to drain off the water and set the soaked pearls aside.\nIn a large saucepan, combine the milk, vanilla, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt and set aside. Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl and whisk them until they are combined. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time, whisking constantly, until all of the sugar is added. Whisk until the egg mixture is a very light yellow color, about 2 minutes, then set aside.\nPlace the saucepan with the milk mixture over low heat and bring to a simmer. Once it begins to bubble, remove the pot from heat and temper the eggs with the hot liquid by whisking the eggs constantly as you add the liquid a little at a time.\nOnce the two mixtures are completely combined, pour the custard back into the original pot and add the tapioca. Whisk constantly over low heat. As you whisk, the mixture will begin to thicken. Watch the pearls, they will become translucent, with just a bit of cloudiness in the centers, indicating that the pudding is done. Do not worry that the pudding looks a bit watery, as extra liquid will be absorbed during the cooling process. Scrape the pudding into a bowl and press plastic wrap directly onto the top surface. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\nRead More\nCreamy Chocolate Tapioca Pudding\nTapioca Pearls with Coconut Milk and Mango (Tambo-Tambo)\nCh\u00e8 Chu\u1ed1i (Vietnamese Banana, Tapioca, and Coconut Milk Dessert)\nVanilla Rice Pudding\nBread Pudding"
