Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until crumbs have dissolved and mixture feels smooth between your fingertips, about 90 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer to a tall, narrow container, stirring occasionally until the steam subsides, about 5 minutes. Add solid coconut oil and process with an immersion blender until homogeneous and smooth.\nVicky Wasik\nTransfer to a glass jar (the cookie butter will readily absorb odors from used plastic containers), seal to prevent moisture loss, and refrigerate to re-solidify the coconut oil, about 2 hours. From there, store and serve at cool room temperature as a spread or dessert topping.\nSpecial Equipment\n2-quart stainless steel saucier\n,\nflexible spatula\n,\nimmersion blender\n, glass jar\nNotes\nIf your grocery doesn't stock golden syrup alongside maple syrup and molasses, plain corn syrup will get the job done. The results won't taste quite as caramelly, but it's not a make-or-break ingredient.\nRead More\nHomemade Nutella (Creamy Chocolate-Hazelnut Spread)\nCajeta Casera (Homemade Goat's Milk \"Caramel\")\nHomemade Pistachio Paste\nBelgian\nDessert Sauces"
