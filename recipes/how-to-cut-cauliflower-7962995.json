  "full_text": "How to Cut Cauliflower\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nhead\ncauliflower\nDirections\nTo Cut Cauliflower Into Florets\nUsing a paring knife, trim away any leaves from around the base of the cauliflower. Then cut the head into quarters.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCut out the central \"core\" from each quarter. Note: The core can be cut up and used in many recipes, do not discard it unless you're certain you don't need or want it.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nOnce the core is removed, using your hands and/or a knife, break off large florets following their natural divisions. In some recipes, you may want to stop there and use the large florets as-is.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor smaller florets, use a knife to cut each floret into smaller portions. If you want a more natural division without a perfectly flat cut side on each floret, you can use a knife to split the branch that holds the flower buds together, then use your hands to pull the flower buds apart; they will break apart more naturally and unevenly this way, which is sometimes desirable. Use as desired.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo Cut Cauliflower Steaks\nThe key to cauliflower \"steaks\" is to keep the core intact and attached to each steak: It is needed to hold the steak together. Begin by trimming away any green leaves growing from the base of the cauliflower head, then cut it vertically into slabs about 1/2 to 1 inch thick. You will inevitably create some trimmings with this, since the outer florets will not be attached to the core once cut (this, in all honesty, makes cauliflower steaks a much better idea for restaurants and a less good one for homes, since restaurants can collect enough of the trimmings to turn them into another menu item, while home cooks can't as easily).\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nHow-Tos\nThe Latest\nKnife Skills"
