Combine starter, flour, salt, sugar, olive oil, and 1 cup water. Work vigorously by hand or with a stand mixer until dough forms a coarse ball that comes away from the sides of the ball, adding more water or flour as necessary, about 4 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes. Turn out onto a lightly floured counter, dust with flour, and knead by hand until soft, supple, and no longer sticky, about 3 minutes. Alternately, mix on low speed in stand mixer until this texture is achieved, 2 to 3 minutes.\nLightly oil a large bowl. From dough into a ball and roll all around bowl until coated with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free environment until dough has increased by at least half in volume. The duration of the rise will depend on the strength of your starter; I let mine sit in a cool oven overnight.\nDivide dough into fourths. Form each piece into a ball and coat with olive oil. Seal each piece in an airtight freezer bag. Let rest at room temperature for 1 hour, and then refrigerate overnight.\nPizza\nSourdough Breads"
