  "full_text": "Matcha Ice Cream and Cookies Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nChurning/Freezing Time\n5 hrs 40 mins\nTotal\n6 hrs 20 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nMakes\n1 quart\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the Matcha Ice Cream:\n2\ncups\nheavy cream\n1\ncup\nwhole milk\n6\negg yolks\n1 1/2\ncups\nsugar\n1/4\ncup\nmatcha\n1\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\nFor the Matcha Cookies:\n1\ncup\nall-purpose flour\n1/4\ncup\nmatcha\n1\npinch\nsalt\n1\nstick\nunsalted butter\n, softened\n2/3\ncup\nsugar\n1\negg\nDirections\nFor the Matcha Ice Cream:\nSet cream and milk on low heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, beat egg yolks with sugar till smooth and a little lighter in color.\nWhen the cream mixture is warm, add it, one ladle at a time, to egg-sugar mixture, whisking vigorously. Pour in the remaining cream after you've incorporated about a quarter of it, and whisk till combined.\nPour everything back into the pot and keep on low heat, reserving a little bit of the custard in the bowl. Add matcha and whisk to form a concentrated paste. The matcha clumps easily, but smooth it out as best you can. A few small lumps aren't a problem.\nAdd this concentrate to the pot and stir to combine. Keep heat as low as possible to prevent eggs from curdling. Stir custard until it coats the back of a wooden spoon and a finger wipes a clean stripe. Add vanilla, then cook for 1 minute longer. Don't let it sit on the heat any longer than you have to; the matcha \"brews\" almost instantly and excess heat exposure can make it bitter.\nPour the custard through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl in an ice bath or a shallow, wide baking dish and let it cool completely. Move it to your ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. If you don't have an ice cream maker, put custard in the freezer and stir it up about every half hour, mixing the solids and liquids, till it has the consistency of ice cream. The results won't be quite the same\u2014it won't be as airy\u2014but it'll still be lusciously creamy.\nFor the Matcha Cookies:\nWhisk together flour, matcha, and salt.\nIn a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar till light and fluffy. Add flour to the mixer in small batches until everything is combined. The dough will have a pie crust-like consistency. Add egg and mix till the dough comes together in a smooth mass.\nLightly flour a work surface and divide the dough in half. Roll each half into a log about an inch in diameter. Incorporate some more flour if the dough is too sticky to work with, but only as much as you need.\nRoll the logs in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator or freezer for at least half an hour. The dough will last for months in the freezer, so you can slice off as many or as few cookies as you'd like.\nBefore baking, heat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) with the rack adjusted in the middle. Slice the dough into uniformly thick rounds (I aim for about 2 to 3 coins' thickness) with a sharp knife and place them on a buttered cookie sheet. You can space them relatively close as they won't spread much.\nFor cookies that retain some chew, bake no longer than 8 minutes, or until the bottoms and edges acquire the slightest hints of brown. For crispier cookies, bake up to 12 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack 30 seconds after removing them from the oven. The cookies keep for a couple days in an air-tight container, but are best eaten immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker, stand mixer, heavy-bottom saucepan, fine-mesh strainer, wooden spoon, ladle, whisk, baking sheet\nRead More\nThe Best Matcha Powders\nFrothy Iced Matcha Green Tea\nMatcha and White Chocolate Popcorn\nIce Cream\nCookies"
