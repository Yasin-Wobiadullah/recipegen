Blend to fully mince garlic and preserved lemon. With the blender running, slowly drizzle in canola oil until a smooth emulsion forms. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.\nWhisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste with salt and a generous amount of black pepper.\nFor the Toasted Breadcrumbs:\nCombine breadcrumbs and oil in a large skillet, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring and tossing occasionally, until crisp and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer toasted breadcrumbs to a rimmed baking sheet, spread into an even layer, and set aside to cool to room temperature.\nFor the Brussels Sprouts:\nUsing a mandoline slicer, very thinly shave \u00bc pound (115g) Brussels sprouts into a medium bowl. Set aside.\nUsing a sharp knife, quarter the remaining 1 pound (450g) Brussels sprouts lengthwise through the stem (for large Brussels sprouts, cut into sixths). Working in batches if necessary, add to an air fryer basket in a single layer, toss lightly with olive oil, season lightly with salt, then cook at the air fryer's highest temperature setting, stopping to toss sprouts every 2 to 3 minutes until deeply browned and crisp all over, about 10 minutes. (Note: Based on our product testing, air fryers can vary significantly in performance and capacity, so whether you can do this in one batch or not, and exactly how long it takes will depend on the specific model you're using; please keep a close eye on the Brussels sprouts as they cook to ensure they brown and crisp to the desired level.)\nTransfer roasted Brussels sprouts to bowl with shaved Brussel sprouts, along with \u00bc cup (30g) of the breadcrumbs. Add \u00bd cup Caesar dressing and toss until well combined and evenly dressed; season with salt and mix in more dressing, if desired.\nScrape dressed Brussels sprouts into a serving dish, then top all over with remaining \u00bc cup breadcrumbs and a generous coating of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Serve.\nNotes\nFor a stronger preserved lemon flavor, feel free to double the quantity in this recipe.\nSpecial Equipment\nAir fryer, immersion blender\nMake Ahead and Storage\nThe Caesar dressing can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. The breadcrumbs can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.\nBrussels Sprouts\nSides\nThe Latest\nAir Fryer Recipes",
