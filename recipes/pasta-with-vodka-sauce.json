Add onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are very soft but not browned, about 15 minutes; lower heat if needed to prevent browning.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nAdd tomato paste and cook, stirring, until tomato paste is fragrant and thick, about 3 minutes. Stir in canned tomatoes with their liquid. Bring to a simmer, then cook, stirring often and crushing the whole tomatoes roughly with a spoon, until sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nAdd cream, and stir to incorporate. Transfer sauce to a blender, and blend until very smooth (you may be able to make an immersion blender work, but in our tests the sauce level was too low to safely avoid splattering). Wipe out pot, then return blended sauce to it. Season lightly with salt.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nIn a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until just shy of al dente, about 3 minutes less than the package directs. About 1 minute before you transfer pasta to sauce, add vodka to tomato sauce and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nUsing a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer pasta directly to sauce pot along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta water (alternatively, reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain pasta in a colander, then add to sauce with 1/2 cup of the reserved water). Increase heat to high, and cook, stirring constantly, until pasta is well coated in sauce and reaches the al dente stage, about 3 minutes. If sauce thickens too much before pasta is ready, add more pasta water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nRemove from heat and stir in cheese until thoroughly incorporated into a smooth and creamy sauce. Taste for salt, and season with more if needed. If you can't detect the vodka at all, you can add a few drops more and stir it in before serving; exactly how boozy you want the sauce is a question of taste, but be careful because a heavy hand will ruin the dish. Spoon pasta and sauce onto warmed serving plates and top with additional grated cheese. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucier\nor\nsaucepan\nor\n5-quart Dutch oven\n,\nblender\n,\nspider skimmer\nor\nslotted spoon\nor\ncolander\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe vodka sauce can be made ahead through Step 3 (blending). Keep refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days. To use, reheat sauce in a pot, then resume recipe instructions with Step 4.\nRead More\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Vodka\nDoes Vodka Sauce Really Need Vodka?\nChicken and Penne in Vodka Cream Sauce Recipe\nPenne With Hot-as-You-Dare Arrabbiata Sauce Recipe\nVodka Pizza Recipe\nPastas\nItalian-American\nStovetop Pasta\nCreamy Pastas\nTomato Sauces"
