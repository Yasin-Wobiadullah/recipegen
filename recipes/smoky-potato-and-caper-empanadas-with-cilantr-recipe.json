Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.\nRinse pan and dry. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chipotle and sauce, capers, curry powder, and potatoes. Stir to combine, lightly mashing potatoes. Season to taste with salt and stir in cilantro. Transfer to a large plate and set aside until completely cool.\nFor the Dough:\nProcess half of flour, masa, and salt in a food processor with three 1-second pulses. Add shortening in chunks and process in 1-second pulses until dough resembles wet sand, about 12 pulses. Add remaining cup flour and pulse 4 times until homogenous. Transfer to a large bowl.\nadd 1/2 cup cold water. Knead dough until it forms a ball. It should feel slightly tacky. If dry, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap dough ball in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use, at least 45 minutes.\nFor the Sauce:\nCombine cilantro, pepper, garlic, and lime juice in a blender. Add 1/4 cup water. Blend until smooth, adding water as necessary and scraping down sides as necessary. Season to taste with salt. Set aside.\nTo Assemble and Cook:\nDivide dough into 12 to 16 even pieces (depending on how large you want them to be). Roll each piece into a ball. Working one piece at a time, roll dough out on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin or press with a tortilla press into a 3 1/2- to 4 1/2-inch round. Place a few teaspoons of filling in the center of each dough round. Brush edges of dough with water and gently fold in half. Crimp edges or press with the tines of a fork to seal. Set aside and repeat with remaining empanadas.\nTo Bake:\nAdjust oven rack to upper and lower middle positions and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper Place empanadas on baking sheet and brush with 2 tablespoons oil. Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 30 minutes. Serve with cilantro sauce.\nTo Fry:\nHeat 2 quarts oil to 350\u00b0F in a large wok or dutch oven. Fry empanadas a half dozen at a time, agitating occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Serve with cilantro sauce.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor, blender\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Vegan Experience Days 20 and 21: The Vegan Super Bowl Snack Challenge\nMexican\nDairy-free Snacks & Appetizers\nVegan Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nSavory",
