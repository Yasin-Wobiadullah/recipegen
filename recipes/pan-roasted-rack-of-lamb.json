If you have more than 1 hour and up to 24 hours before you need to serve the lamb, set the racks uncovered on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to cook. If not, proceed immediately to cooking.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large stainless-steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add racks meaty side down and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, turn racks meaty side up and cook until lightly browned on the underside, about 2 minutes (the ribs curve, so the underside won't make complete contact with the pan). Stand the racks, so the bones are pointing upwards, and sear so that the underside is lightly browned (you may need to lean the racks against each other to keep them from falling).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd butter, garlic, and thyme to the pan and let melt. Lower heat to medium and cook the lamb, flipping the racks often and basting constantly with the hot butter, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the eye of the loin registers 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for medium, about 20 minutes (though please note that the cooking time will vary heavily depending on the size of the racks, which range from quite small to big and meaty); make sure to spend some time basting the ribs side of the racks so that they cook there too.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLet rest 5 minutes, then carve into individual chops and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch stainless-steel\n,\ncast iron\n, or\ncarbon steel skillet\n,\ntongs\nNotes\nIf you want, you can alter this recipe by starting with the reverse sear: put the seasoned lamb on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a low 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) oven and cook until the eye of the loin registers your target temperature on an instant-read thermometer, then transfer to the hot skillet with butter, garlic, and herbs just long enough to give it a good final sear.\nRead More\nHow to Clean and French a Lamb Rack\nHow to Carve a Rack of Lamb the Right Way\nCrown Roast of Lamb With Couscous Stuffing and Pistachio-Mint Sauce\nMustard and Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb\nGrilled Moroccan-Spiced Rack of Lamb\nRack of Lamb\nEaster\nStovetop Lamb\nLamb Mains\nSpring Mains"
