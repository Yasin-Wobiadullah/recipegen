  "full_text": "Real Texas Nachos Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n3\nto 4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2 to 3\ncups\ncanola or\npeanut oil\n6\ncorn tortillas\n, cut into quarters\n4\nounces\nLonghorn cheese\n, grated (see note)\n24\nslices\npickled jalape\u00f1os\nKosher salt\n, to taste\nDirections\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Heat oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet, Dutch oven, or wok over medium-high heat until it registers 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Adjust flame to maintain temperature. Working in batches, add tortillas and fry, agitating with a metal spider, until edges just start to brown. Flip chips over and continue to cook until crisp and light golden brown. Transfer chips to a paper towel lined tray, sprinkle with salt to taste, and let sit for 2-3 minutes to drain. Repeat with remaining batches.\nTransfer chips to a foil lined baking sheet. Top each with with approximately 1 tablespoon of cheese and 1 jalape\u00f1o slice (if using beans, add 1 tablespoon of beans before adding cheese). Place in oven and bake until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from oven and serve immediately.\nNotes\nLonghorn cheese, a type of Colby, is the authentic (and in my opinion, superior) choice. If you cannot find Longhorn locally, try substituting Colby or\none of the cheeses I mention above\n.\nRead More\nThe Ultimate Fully Loaded Nachos Recipe\nWeeknight Cheesy Summer Corn Nachos Recipe\nMicrowave Nachos for One Recipe\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nCheese\nJalapenos",
