Transfer to an airtight jar and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nFor the Shrimp:\nPat shrimp dry with paper towels. In a large bowl, toss shrimp with kosher salt and baking soda until evenly coated. Cover and set aside to brine in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Uncover and toss shrimp with 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning until evenly coated.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nIn a 12-inch skillet set over medium-high heat, melt butter and oil until the butter foams and begins to subside. Add shrimp in a single layer and cook until the bottom is golden brown, about 90 seconds (see note). Flip shrimp and continue cooking until just translucent in the center, about 90 seconds more. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch nonstick skillet\nNotes\nIf you can\u2019t find jumbo shrimp, you can substitute with large shrimp. Keep in mind that large shrimp will cook faster than jumbo shrimp, about 60 seconds per side. We do not recommend using small or medium shrimp.\nIf you can\u2019t fit the shrimp in a single layer without crowding, cook it in two batches. Wipe out the skillet between batches and use additional oil and butter as needed.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe seasoning blend can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 months.\nShrimp\nThe Latest\nGluten-free\nSeafood\nCajun & Creole",
