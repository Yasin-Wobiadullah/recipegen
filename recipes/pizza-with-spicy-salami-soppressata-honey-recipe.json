Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking. Transfer tomatoes to a medium bowl and roughly crush by hand. Season to taste with salt and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdjust oven rack to 6 inches under broiler and\nplace stone or steel on rack\n. Preheat oven to highest possible temperature (500 or 550\u00b0F/200 or 260\u00b0C) for at least 45 minutes. Alternatively, use a KettlePizza and Baking Steel grill insert.\nWhen ready to bake, turn one dough ball out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into a rough 8-inch circle, leaving the outer 1 inch higher than the center. Gently stretch dough into a 10- to 12-inch circle, about 1/4 inch thick, by draping over knuckles and gently stretching. Transfer to floured wooden pizza peel.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPreheat broiler to high. Spread a thin layer of crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Spread 1/4 of mozzarella over pizza, followed by 1/4 of Parmesan, 1/4 of sliced sopressata, 1/4 of chiles, and 1/4 of basil leaves. Sprinkle lightly with salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTransfer pizza to hot stone or steel and broil, rotating regularly for even cooking, until edges are puffed and lightly charred and bottom is crisp, 3 to 6 minutes total. Retrieve pizza with a metal peel and transfer to a cutting board. Allow to rest 1 minute. Meanwhile, switch oven back to 550\u00b0F to reheat stone or steel for remaining pizzas.\nDrizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon honey, slice, and serve.\nSerious Eats / J.
