  "full_text": "Spike the Kiddie Table (Sparkling Cider Rum Cocktail) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n2 mins\nActive\n2 mins\nTotal\n2 mins\nServes\n1 drink (see note)\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2\nounces\n(\n45\nml\n)\naged rum\n(see notes)\n3/4\nounce\n(\n20\nml\n)\nfresh apple cider\n1/2\nounce\n(\n15\nml\n)\nfresh juice\nfrom\n1\nwhole\nlemon\n1\nounce\n(\n30\nml\n) chilled\nsparkling apple cider\n(such as Martinelli's)\nStar anise pod\nand/or an\napple chip\n, for garnish (optional)\nDirections\nCombine rum, apple cider, and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker.\nFill cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until well chilled, about 12 seconds. Double-strain into a chilled Champagne flute. Top off with sparkling cider and garnish with star anise and apple chip, if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nCocktail shaker and strainer,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nTo batch the cocktail, multiply the quantities of rum, fresh cider, and lemon by the number of servings you'd like. Combine in a resealable bottle or container up to two hours before serving, seal well, and refrigerate. Stir the mixture well, and keep the container cold by standing it up in a bucket of ice. When ready to serve, pour five and a half ounces of the mix into a cocktail shaker. Proceed with step 2, dividing shaken mix between two flutes and topping each flute with an ounce of sparkling cider.\nAged rum contributes a toasty caramel note that's lifted with lemon, but if you're a hardcore whiskey fan, I recommend also trying this one with Scotch or peppery rye. (Some may prefer to add a drop\u2014or a quarter ounce\u2014of 1:1 simple or honey syrup to the whiskey version.)\nRum",
