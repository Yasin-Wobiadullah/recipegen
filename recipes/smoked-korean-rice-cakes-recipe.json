Put about 2 tablespoons of wood chips in center of roasting pan, inside the ring of aluminum foil and set the pan over medium-high heat.\nMeanwhile, using a pair of scissors, punch 9 holes all over the bottom of another disposable aluminum roasting pan. Set rice cakes inside perforated roasting pan in a single even layer.\nWhen wood chips begin to smolder and smoke, set perforated pan over the bottom pan so that it is sitting on the ring of aluminum foil. Wearing oven mitts, carefully crimp aluminum foil over both pans to seal in smoke. Turn off heat the heat and let rice cakes smoke for 10 minutes.\nUsing oven mitts, remove foil in a single piece by un-crimping edges and lift perforated roasting pan out of the smoking pan. Check the wood chips: If they are entirely burnt, add 2 more tablespoons wood chips; if not, continue to work with the chips left in the roasting pan. Turn heat to medium and wait for wood chips to smoke and smolder again. Set perforated pan on top again, cover with the foil, and turn off the heat once more. Let smoke for 10 minutes longer. Remove foil and transfer the rice cakes to a baking sheet to cool completely.\nTransfer cooled rice cakes to a zipper-top bag or plastic container and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 days.\nSpecial equipment\n2 disposable aluminum roasting pans\nThis Recipe Appears In\nIdeas in Food vs. Linguine alle Vongole: Part 1\nRice & Grains\nKorean\nVegetarian Mains\nVegetarian Sides\nSmoking"
