  "full_text": "World's Easiest Pasta (Frascarelli) From 'Pasta Modern'\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n2 hrs\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n75 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 15 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\ncups\n(680g)\nsemolina flour\n2\nlarge\neggs\n1\nrosemary\nbranch\n(optional)\nSalt\nOlive oil\n3\nsweet sausages\nPecorino cheese\nDirections\nSpread the semolina flour onto a large wooden board. In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup (120 ml) water. Drip the egg mixture onto the flour, a little at a time, using a fork or rosemary branch, and stir with your finger tips to form little nuggets. As they form, pick the resulting nuggets out of the flour and into a mesh sifter. Shake off any excess flour and transfer the nuggets onto a cotton dishcloth. Repeat until the egg mixture is used up, adding more flour if needed. Let the nuggets air dry uncovered, for 2 hours.\nBring 1 quart (960 ml) lightly salted water to a boil and add the pasta nuggets. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until tender.\nMeanwhile, in a small saut\u00e9 pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium high-heat. Remove the meat from the sausage casings, add it to the pan and cook until it is lightly browned, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon as it cooks.\nOnce the pasta is tender, spread it out onto a serving platter or wooden board, and top with the sausage and a generous sprinkling of shaved or grated cheese and drizzle of olive oil.\nPasta Mains\nItalian",
