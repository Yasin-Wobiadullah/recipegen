Remove from water. Line the sheets up on a cutting board and roll into a cylinder. Cut crosswise into 1-inch segments, at least a foot in length.\nIn a medium sized mixing bowl, combine pork, egg white, ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, white pepper, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, and minced shiitake. Mix with hands to combine.\nUsing about 2 tablespoons of meat filing per segment of tofu skin, roll up the filling in the tofu skin, forming fairly tight cylinders. Combine remaining teaspoon soy sauce and teaspoon cornstarch in a small bowl and stir with a fork until homogenous. Add chicken stock and set aside.\nHeat oil in the wok to 350 F. Fry the cylinders of tofu skin, a couple at a time, until the surface is light brown and somewhat puffed up. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\nLine up all the fried rolls in a shallow bowl that can fit into a metal or bamboo steamer. Pour the sauce over the rolls, and steam over high heat for 15 minutes, flipping the rolls halfway through. Steam until the skin has absorbed at least half of the sauce. Serve immediately, garnishing with cilantro or green onions, if desired.\nSpecial equipment\nSteamer\nThis Recipe Appears In\nChichi's Chinese: Tofu Skin 'Noodles' and Rolls\nMains\nChinese\nFried Tofu\nPork\nTofu"
