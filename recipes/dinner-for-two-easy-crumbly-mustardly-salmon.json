Pulse bread in the bowl of a food processor until coarse crumbs are created, about 10 to 12 one-second pulses. Season the salmon with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon butter, both mustards, and thyme, pinching the mixture together so the butter is incorporated and the mixture sticks together. Season with salt and pepper.\nSpread the bottom of each fillet of salmon with a thin layer of butter. Preheat a medium skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add salmon buttered-side down and cook without moving until a nice crust has formed, about 2 minutes. Pile the crumbs on the salmon, then transfer to the broiler. Broil until the crumbs are crunchy and browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, medium\nskillet\nRead More\nCrispy Pan-Seared Salmon Fillets Recipe\nHarissa-Honey Glazed Roasted Salmon Recipe\nOne-Skillet Salmon With Curried Leeks and Yogurt-Herb Sauce Recipe\nBroiled Salmon With Dilly Beans Recipe\nSalmon\nRoasted Seafood\nSeafood Mains\nQuick Dinners"
