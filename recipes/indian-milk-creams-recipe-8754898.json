  "full_text": "Milk Creams\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nCooling and Setting Time\n14 hrs\nTotal\n14 hrs 35 mins\nServes\n20\nto 40 milk cream discs\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nOne 14-ounce (\n396\ng\n) can\nsweetened condensed milk\n3 1/2 ounces (\n100\ng\n) sifted, finely ground\nraw cashews\n(about 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons)\n1\ntablespoon\n(14g) unsalted butter or\nghee\n, plus extra for greasing, kneading and shaping the milk creams\n1 teaspoon (\n5\nml\n) vanilla extract or\nalmond extract\nDirections\nPrepare an ice bath by combining cold water and ice cubes in a small mixing bowl. Lightly grease a dinner plate with butter or ghee. If using silicone molds, grease them lightly with butter or ghee; if you are not using silicone molds, lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with butter or ghee.\nCombine sweetened condensed milk and ground cashews in a 3-quart saucier and stir with a rubber spatula until smooth. Place over low heat and, stirring constantly, bring mixture to 179\u00b0F (81\u00b0C), taking care not to exceed 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C). Continue stirring constantly to prevent scorching or caramelization and cook until mixture reduces to a very thick paste the consistency of very thick, creamy peanut butter, 15 to 45 minutes. (Timing will depend on how closely you maintain a cooking temperature of 179\u00b0F.)\nTo Test the Dough:\nUsing a 1-teaspoon measuring spoon, drop a walnut-size portion of dough into the prepared ice bath and wait 1 minute. Using clean fingers, remove the chilled dough and try to form it into a ball; if the dough easily forms a non-sticky ball, the dough is ready. If the dough does not easily form a ball or is still quite sticky, continue to heat the cashew mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, and keep testing dough every 2 minutes until it reaches the desired consistency.\nRemove dough from heat and add 1 tablespoon (14g) butter or ghee and vanilla extract, stirring to thoroughly combine. Transfer dough to prepared, lightly greased plate and spread it out into a flat, even layer. Set aside and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.\nGrease your palms and fingers with 1 teaspoon (5g) of butter or ghee and knead cooled dough until it is no longer sticky, about 4 minutes.\nIf Using Silicone Molds:\nPortion dough into molds and, using knife, trim dough so it is flattened flush with the top of the mold. Set molds on the counter, covered with a clean kitchen towel if desired, until the surface is firm to touch and slightly dry, about 12 hours. Unmold milk creams and serve.\nIf Using Rimmed Baking Sheet:\nWorking with 1 tablespoon (20g) of dough at a time, shape dough into 1-inch discs and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet, leaving a 1-inch (2.5cm) space between each milk cream. Using a fork, prick the tops of the milk cream discs to form a decorative pattern. Set the baking sheet on the counter, covered with a clean kitchen towel if desired, until the surface is firm to touch and slightly dry, about 12 hours. Serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n,\n3-quart saucier\n, silicone spatula, silicone molds\nNotes\nUsing a food processor to make your own cashew flour from raw, skinned cashews is an option; however, I strongly recommend you purchase finely ground cashew flour from a store or online.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nMilk creams can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature.\nCandy\nIndian\nDesserts\nChristmas Candies"
