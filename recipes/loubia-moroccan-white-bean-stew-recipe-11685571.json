Add salt and baking soda, stir briefly to combine, then cover loosely and let soak at room temperature at least 8 and up to 12 hours. Drain the beans, then rinse well under running tap water.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor the Stew:\nIn a large pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, garlic, tomato paste, cumin, paprika, turmeric, ginger, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdd lamb and mix to combine, then let cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdd drained and rinsed white beans, grated tomatoes, and stock. If beans aren\u2019t completely covered with liquid, add enough water to just cover them. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low; cover, and cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer, until lamb is tender and beans are fully cooked and creamy, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. As beans cook, add water if needed to avoid scorching and to maintain a stew-like consistency.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSeason to taste with salt. Serve in shallow bowls with crusty bread on the side. Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with cilantro, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot or Dutch oven\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe stew can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Reheat gently before serving.\nBraised & Stewed Beans\nThe Latest\nLamb\nMoroccan",
