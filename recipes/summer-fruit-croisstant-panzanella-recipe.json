  "full_text": "Summer Fruit Panzanella Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n25 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/4\ncup\nplus\n1\ntablespoon\nsugar\n, divided\n5\ncups\nmixed summer fruit\n(see note)\n1/2\ntablespoon\ncinnamon\n6\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n, melted\n4\ncups\ncubed\ncroissants\n(see note)\n2\ntablespoons\nchopped\nfresh mint\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine fruit and 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl; set aside.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together cinnamon and sugar. In a large bowl, combine cubes of croissant and butter and toss until bread absorbs butter. Add about 3/4 of cinnamon sugar mixture and toss to combine. Spread cubes out on baking sheet, sprinkling with remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake until toasted and golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.\nIn a large bowl, combine fruit and their juices with toasted croissants and mint and gently toss to combine. Divide between plates and serve.\nNotes\nI tried a variety of different breads before settling on croissants. They were of the store-bought, puffy variety, not flaky or delicate, which meant they held up well in the oven. A good substitution would be challah, though any day-old bread you have can be substituted in a pinch.\nI used a combination of blueberries, blackberries, and plums, but for the best results, use whatever fruit is ripest.\nDesserts\nFruit\nSummer Salads",
