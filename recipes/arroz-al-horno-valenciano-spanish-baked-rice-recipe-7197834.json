In a 1-quart measuring cup, stir the 1 tablespoon salt into the stock until dissolved; set aside. Season ribs and pork belly all over with salt and pepper; set aside.\nIn a 3 1/2-quart saut\u00e9 pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add potato slices and cook, turning once, until deeply golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Using a thin, slotted spatula, transfer potatoes to a plate and season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nImmediately add pork ribs and belly to skillet and cook, stirring and turning occasionally, until browned all over, about 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nStir in rice, paprika, and saffron, and cook until rice is evenly coated in oil and very lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in chicken stock, then nestle in thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf. Make sure to scrape down sides of pan so that all grains of rice are submerged in the liquid.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhile you wait for the liquid to come to a simmer, add chickpeas in an even layer on top of the rice (they will mostly be submerged). Place the head of garlic in the center of the pan and arrange the morcilla (if using), fried potato slices, and tomato slices in a ring around it. Season tomato lightly with salt.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAs soon as liquid has come to a strong simmer, transfer to oven and bake until liquid is fully absorbed and rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Let rest uncovered for 5 minutes, then serve directly from the pan at the table.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nCutting the ribs into segments requires cleaving through fairly thick bone, which is often something better left for the butcher to do. The smaller segments are more manageable and make serving the rice easier, but don't worry if you can't do this, it will still work with full-length ribs. If you don't have a butcher to cut the ribs, we recommend using baby back ribs here, as they're naturally smaller. Otherwise, baby back or spare ribs will work if cut into smaller lengths.\nSpanish short-grain rice is typically sold in 500g or 1kg bags, hence why this recipe calls for the rice in grams.\nRice & Grain Mains\nThe Latest\nMains\nEurope\nSpanish",
