  "full_text": "Chelow (Persian Steamed White Rice)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n60 mins\nSoaking Time\n2 hrs\nTotal\n3 hrs 15 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nMakes\n5 cups of rice\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\nbasmati rice\n(\n13 3/4\nounces\n;\n390\ng\n)\n6\ntablespoons\n(\n54\ng\n) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n, divided, plus more as needed; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight\n3\ntablespoons\n(\n42\ng\n)\nunsalted butter\n(see notes)\n2\ngenerous pinches\nground saffron\n(optional)\nDirections\nIn a large bowl, cover rice with enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Using your hand, swirl the rice around until the water turns cloudy. Pour off the cloudy water through a fine-mesh strainer, then return rice to bowl and refill with fresh cold water. Repeat the process until the water runs clear, about 5 or 6 times. Drain the washed rice well in the colander.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nReturn drained rice to large bowl along with 3 tablespoons (27g) salt. Add enough cold tap water to cover the rice by 1 inch. Gently stir to dissolve the salt. Let stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Drain in the small-hole colander.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nIn a large pot or Dutch oven, bring 2 quarts (1.9L) water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add 3 tablespoons (27g) salt. Add drained rice, then gently stir to ensure that there is no clumped rice and there is no rice stuck to the bottom of the pot. Return to a vigorous boil, then cook until the the rice has grown 1.5 to 2 times in length and the outside of each grain is cooked but not mushy and the center of the grain shows some resistance, 5 to 8 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and drain through a small-hole colander.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nRinse rice well with cold water for about 30 seconds (you want to stop the cooking and to wash off any excess starch released during boiling). Taste a few grains of rice for saltiness; if more seasoning is desired, sprinkle rice all over with 1 teaspoon salt. In a small pot, combine butter with 1/3 cup (80ml) water and heat just until butter is melted. If using saffron, in a very small bowl, steep ground saffron in two tablespoons of hot water; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nWash the pot used to parboil the rice. Pour half of the water and butter mixture into the pot. Using a large spoon or a spatula, gently mound the parboiled rice into the center of the bottom of the pot; do not dump the rice from the colander. Instead, carefully build the mound up, making sure the rice forms a mountain shape and does not touch the sides of the pot. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make 6 to 8 holes deep into the mound including one in the center (this will facilitate the release of steam from the lower parts of the mound).\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nWrap the pot\u2019s lid in a clean, thick kitchen towel, then cover the pot tightly (wrapping the lid in a kitchen towel prevents steam from escaping and absorbs any moisture that would have condensed on the inside of the lid and dripped down on the rice). Set over medium-high heat and cook until you can hear sizzling sounds inside the pot and steam begins to fill it (you can carefully lift the lid to peak if unsure), about 5 minutes. Uncover pot, gently pour the remaining water-butter mixture over the rice mound, then re-cover pot with the towel-wrapped lid. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until rice is tender and fluffy, about 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nUsing a slotted spoon or a spatula, and starting from the top of the mound of rice in the pot, gently spoon the rice onto the center of a serving platter to form a mound. After each spoonful, fluff the rice in the pot before transferring the next spoonful. Continue until you reach the near bottom of the pot where you may find a crunchy layer of rice (the crunchy layer of rice at the bottom of the pot is a Persian delicacy called tahdig; scrape it off\u2014it may or may not come out in one piece\u2014and serve it on a separate small plate to be shared among the diners).\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nIf using saffron, add 2 or 3 heaping tablespoons of cooked rice to the prepared saffron water and stir to evenly coat. Sprinkle the golden yellow grains of saffroned rice garnish on top of the mound of rice in the serving platter. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer, small-hole colander (so rice doesn't slip through), large pot\nNotes\nThe recipe detailed above calls for using Indian or Pakistani basmati rice. If you happen to get your hands on rice grown in Iran, since their grains are harder than Indian and Pakistani basmati rice, increase the soaking time to four hours. If you use American basmati rice, since they are typically not aged, reduce the soaking time to 30 minutes.\nYou can substitute the butter with ghee or vegetable oil, if desired, though butter will yield the most aromatic and rich-tasting tahdig.\nThere are a few spots during the parboiling stage and the steaming stage where it is impossible to specify the exact timing due to variability in the type of rice that you might be using, the heat transfer properties of your cooking vessels, the settings of your burners, etc. That is why the recipe provides other means to monitor the cooking process: by tasting, by feeling, by biting, by listening, etc. For more consistent results, the first time you are making this recipe, you should take notes as to what you did, then note needed adjustments that will enhance the results based on what you're using in your kitchen. In addition, to ensure consistency, I always use the same burner on my home kitchen\u2019s stove to make chelow; I have even marked the control knob for that burner with additional indicators for better heat control, and always use the same two pots when making chelow to avoid any unnecessary variables.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nIf you don\u2019t have time to soak the rice for the recommended 2 hours, you can soak it for 1 hour instead.\nWhen I make chelow at home, I always make much more than I need for the immediate meal because if stored and warmed up properly, the aroma, texture and fluffiness of the leftover rice is nearly as good as freshly cooked chelow. For storing leftover rice, it's best not to put warm cooked rice directly into the refrigerator, as it will turn your leftovers into clumps. Instead, spread your leftover warm rice onto a baking sheet as close to a single layer as possible, let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then scoop into an airtight container. Refrigerate and use within 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months.\nMicrowaves are ideal for reheating leftover rice. Put your leftover rice in a microwave-safe container, add a few tablespoons of water, cover tightly, and zap for a minute or two. The microwave will turn the added water into steam which in turn will warm and fluff up your leftover rice. You can put some aroma back into the warmed-up rice by pouring a few tablespoons of hot melted butter or ghee on top. You can also garnish it with a bit of saffron liquid for color and aroma. Instead of your microwave, you can also warm up your leftover in your oven in a tightly covered, oven-safe container with several tablespoons of water added; this is particularly efficient if you already have your oven on for other purposes.\nRead More\nHow to Make Tahdig (Persian Crunchy Rice)\nIranian & Persian\nThe Latest\nWhite Rice\nRice & Grain Mains\nMiddle Eastern Cuisines",
