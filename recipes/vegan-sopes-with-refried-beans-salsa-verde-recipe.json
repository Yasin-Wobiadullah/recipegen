Add half of onions and half of jalape\u00f1os and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add beans and 1/2 cup water. Cook until heated through, about 4 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash the beans until desired consistency is reached, adding water as necessary. Add lime juice and half of cilantro. Season to taste with salt cover, and set aside in a warm place. Combine remaining onion, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro in a small bowl and set aside.\nFor the Sope Shells\n: Combine instant masa with 1 teaspoon salt and lukewarm water according to package directions. Knead until a smooth dough is formed. Divide dough into 8 balls. Using your fingertips against a wooden board, gently flatten one ball into a disk about 1/4-inch thick and 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Carefully form a little lip around the edge of the disks with your fingertips. Repeat with remaining balls.\nHeat remaining 1 1/2 quarts oil in a large wok or deep cast iron skillet to 350\u00b0F (176\u00b0C). Add the sope shells one at a time until they are all in the oil. Cook, carefully turning occasionally, until shells are golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted metal spider. Season with salt immediately.\nTo serve, divide bean mixture evenly on top of sope shells and drizzle with salsa verde. Sprinkle with toasted pepitas, then top with remaining onions, cilantro, and jalape\u00f1o. Serve immediately with extra lemon or lime wedges on the side.\nNotes\nStore-bought sope shells or tostada shells can be used in place of the homemade shells in step 2. Vegetarian refried beans can be used in place of making your own in step 1.\nRead More\nVegan Migas (Mexican-Style Fried Tortillas With Tofu)\nTepache (Mexican Fermented Pineapple Drink)\nPinto Beans\nDairy-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains",
