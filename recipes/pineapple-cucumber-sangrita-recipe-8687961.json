Fresh fruit juices can vary significantly in terms of flavor, sweetness, and tartness, so don't just follow the recipe blindly: Make sure to taste the sangrita and adjust to get the balance just right.\nIf you don't own a juicer, you can blend peeled pineapple and cucumber separately in a\nblender\n, then fine-strain out the pulp to make juice; skim pineapple juice of any foam.\nTequila\nMexican\nPineapple"
