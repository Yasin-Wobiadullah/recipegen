Once it\u2019s boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the farro until tender, for about 15 to 20 minutes. If any extra water or broth remains, drain it. Set the farro aside until the vegetables are ready.\nPrepare vegetables:\nPreheat your oven to 400 degrees. Coat two large baking sheets with one tablespoon olive oil each. Peel carrots and parsnips, and cut them into 2- inch lengths. If they\u2019re skinny, quarter them lengthwise to make batons. If they\u2019re thicker, cut them into matchsticks about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Spread the vegetables on prepared baking sheets, and sprinkle them with salt. Roast for 20 minutes, then toss them about in their pan, before roasting them for a further 10 minutes.\nAssemble salad:\nWhisk the dressing ingredients together, seasoning to taste with pinches of salt. Use more harissa if you\u2019d like more heat; I suggest a restrained amount, because the heat of harissas can vary widely. In a large bowl, combine farro and roasted vegetables. Stir in most of the mint and feta, leaving a spoonful of each for garnish. Stir in dressing, to taste. Serve, garnished with the reserved feta and mint.\nDo ahead:\nThis salad keeps in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days in the fridge.\nGrain Salads\nVegetarian Salads\nRoasted Vegetables\nFarro & Other Wheat\nParsnip"
