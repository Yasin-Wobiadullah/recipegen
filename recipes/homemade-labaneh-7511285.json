  "full_text": "Homemade Labaneh (Labneh)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n2 hrs\nCook\n10 mins\nCulturing Time\n60 hrs\nTotal\n62 hrs 10 mins\nMakes\n2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ngallon\n(\n1.8\nliters\n)\nmilk\n(see notes)\n2\ntablespoons\n(\n30\nml\n)\nyogurt with active live cultures\n(see note)\n1/4\ntsp\nkosher salt\nDirections\nIn a medium saucepan or saucier, heat milk gently over medium heat until it reaches 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Keep the milk between 180 and 190\u00b0F (82 to 88\u00b0C) for at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes (how long you hold the milk at this temperature will change how much water steams off and how concentrated the milk proteins and fats end up, changing the final texture of the yogurt; there's no one right way to do it).\nAllow the milk to cool to about 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C). In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt with a few spoonfuls of the warm milk, then scrape the yogurt mixture into the pot of lukewarm milk. Stir well to distribute the yogurt culture.\nTransfer the cultured milk to glass jars, the vessels of a yogurt maker, an Indian clay yogurt pot, or whatever incubating device you may have, such as a slow cooker or Instant Pot.\nCover the jars and keep warm; how you do this depends on what you have at home. You can submerge the jars up to their necks in the temperature-controlled water of an immersion circulator (set to 110\u00b0F or the incubation temperature of your choosing); place them in a turned-off oven with the light switched on; wrap them in kitchen towels and hold them in a warm place; submerge them in 110\u00b0F water held in a cooler; use a yogurt maker, etc.\nHow long it takes the yogurt to set will depend on the temperature at which it is held. This can be as short as 3 or 4 hours and as long as 18 hours. Once the yogurt has set, allow it to sit out at room temperature for up to an additional 12 hours to ensure a strong culture; if you're working with a culture you know well, you may not need to let it sit out for so long, especially if you don't want it to grow too sour. There's no one good rule here except to give the yogurt the time it needs to sour and thicken properly.\nLine a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth or a large coffee filter and set it over a large bowl. Spoon the yogurt into the prepared strainer, transfer to the refrigerator, and allow the whey to drip out until the yogurt has thickened to your desired level, about 24 hours (labaneh should be thicker than Greek yogurt). You should have about 2 1/2 to 3 cups strained yogurt at this point (you can drink the drained whey or use it in some baked goods or other preparations.)\nAmanda Suarez / Serious Eats\nTransfer strained yogurt to a mixing bowl and stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt until evenly distributed, then taste and add additional salt, if desired (labaneh should be noticeably seasoned but not taste strongly salted). Transfer the labaneh to an airtight container and keep refrigerated.\nNotes\nYou can use milk of any fat percentage, though whole milk will yield the richest results; you can also use homogenized or creamline milk; pasteurized milk will work, but try to avoid ultra-pasteurized products, which can have trouble setting properly.\nYou can use any store-bought plain yogurt or labaneh with active live cultures, or spoon some of your homemade labaneh into a future batch; all will work beautifully. If you use a freeze-dried yogurt culture, follow the manufacturer's instructions. (It's worth mentioning that different types of yogurt can have different microbial profiles, so using store-bought labaneh may get you a little closer to the real deal than other yogurts, though in my tests I didn't notice much of a difference; they all worked well.) Just make sure to pick out a yogurt that doesn\u2019t contain stabilizers, as they can affect draining.\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucepan or saucier, instant-read thermometer, fine-mesh strainer, cheesecloth or large coffee filter\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe labaneh can be refrigerated for up to two weeks.\nYogurt & Cultured Dairy\nThe Latest\nMiddle Eastern"
