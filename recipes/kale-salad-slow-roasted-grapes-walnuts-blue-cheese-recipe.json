Very lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil, then scatter grapes all over. Cook in oven, checking periodically for doneness, until grapes are nicely shriveled and semi-dried but still slightly plump, about 3 hours. Let cool. Use a thin metal spatula to free any grapes that are stuck to the baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, drizzle kale leaves with just enough olive oil to coat very lightly, then season with salt. Using your hands, massage kale leaves all over with oil, making sure to coat all surfaces and kneading with your hands to help break down the tougher pieces, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a medium skillet, heat walnuts over medium-high heat, tossing frequently, until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Alternatively, toast nuts in the microwave\nfollowing these directions\n. Let cool, then crumble roughly in your hands.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen ready to serve, toss kale with oven-dried grapes, walnuts, and cheese. Drizzle with just enough vinaigrette to lightly coat, tossing to combine. Season with salt and pepper and toss in more vinaigrette if desired. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nYou can make a double or triple batch of oven-dried grapes to maximize your oven usage. Store the cooled dried grapes in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week.\nRead More\nOven-Dried Grapes (a.k.a.
