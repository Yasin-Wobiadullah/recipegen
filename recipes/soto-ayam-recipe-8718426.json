Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until\u00a0 chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Shri Repp\nFor the Spice Paste:\nMeanwhile, using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind peppercorns and coriander seeds into a coarse powder.\nSerious Eats / Shri Repp\nIn the bowl of a food processor, combine ground peppercorns and coriander seeds with crushed candlenuts or macadamias, garlic, ginger, ground turmeric, and salt. Pulse until thick paste forms, about 2 minutes, using a flexible spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. (Spice paste should have the texture of cooked oatmeal; if at any time the paste stops moving in the food processor, add oil or water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it starts moving again.)\nSerious Eats / Shri Repp\nTo Finish:\nUsing tongs, remove chicken from pot and transfer to a plate. Let chicken stand until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Shred meat and set aside. Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain soup base into a 2-quart or larger liquid measuring cup or a large bowl. (You should have about 6 cups soup base; top up with water if necessary. Pour soup base into a clean 4-quart pot and discard the bones.\nSerious Eats / Shri Repp\nIn an 8-inch nonstick skillet set over medium heat, heat oil until shimmering. Add the spice paste, lemongrass, and lime leaves, and fry until fragrant and slightly darkened,\u00a0 about 1 minute. Add mixture to soup base and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until flavors meld, 30 minutes. Season with salt, adding more if necessary.\nSerious Eats / Shri Repp\nDivide shredded chicken, noodles, mung bean sprouts, eggs, green onion, celery, and shallots among 4 bowls. Pour 1 to 1-1/4 cup hot soup into each bowl. Just before serving, shower with crushed potato chips. Serve with kecap, sambal, and limes.\nSerious Eats / Shri Repp\nSpecial Equipment\n6-quart pot, mortar and pestle or spice grinder, food processor, tongs, fine-mesh strainer, 2-quart or larger liquid measuring cup, 4-quart pot, 8-inch nonstick skillet\nNotes\nThis recipe makes 4 servings for a light lunch or as part of a multi-course, family-style meal. It can be served with rice for a heartier meal.\nMildly toxic when raw, candlenut (kemiri) is used as a thickener in Indonesian cooking. In Hawaii, it is known as kukui nut and is a common ingredient in poke. You can find candlenuts at Asian grocery stores specializing in Southeast Asian cuisines and online. Macadamias have a similarly high oil content and texture when pounded and are a good substitute.\nTo prepare lemongrass, trim 1-inch off the top and bottom. Remove the loose outer leaves and bruise the bulb with the butt of a knife or use a meat pounder or heavy glass. The stalk will be pliable enough to tie into a knot.\nChinese celery, or seledri in Indonesian, is used for its leaves rather than stalks in Indonesian cooking. If you can't find it, you can substitute with regular celery leaves or flat leaf parsley.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup base (step 1) can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated.\nThe spice paste can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to 3 months.\nChicken\nThe Latest\nNoodles\nIndonesian"
