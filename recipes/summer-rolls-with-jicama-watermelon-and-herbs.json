Set aside.\nFor the Summer Rolls:\nBefore you begin, dampen a clean kitchen towel with water and lay over cutting board to create a surface to wrap the rolls. Fill a shallow dish, like a pie plate, with water.\nWorking with one rice paper wrap at a time, quickly dip each into the dish of water and place onto the kitchen towel\u2013lined board. (The rice paper will not soften immediately, but it will while you place ingredients onto it.) Top the wrapper with a few leaves of mint, cilantro, and basil across the center of the wrapper. Top with a layer of jicama and watermelon matchsticks. Sprinkle a spoonful of peanuts and ginger over the matchsticks. Season the filling with a squeeze of lime juice and a pinch of salt.\nTo wrap the summer roll, first fold the right and left sides of the rice paper over the ingredients. (If the rice paper is too sticky, moisten your hands with water before handling.) Start with the end closest to you, lift the edge of the paper and fold over the ingredients, rolling tightly up to the top. Repeat with remaining ingredients and serve immediately with coconut sauce.\nNotes\nCoconut aminos is a salty-sweet condiment made from coconut sap, with dark, savory flavors similar to soy sauce. If you don't have any on hand, feel free to substitute it with 2 teaspoons of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of sugar.\nSpecial equipment\nChef's knife\n,\npie plate\nThis Recipe Appears In\nNo-Cook Watermelon Summer Rolls Are the Easiest Way to Beat the Heat\nSnacks & Appetizers\nNo-Cook\nWatermelon\nJicama\nQuick Snacks"
