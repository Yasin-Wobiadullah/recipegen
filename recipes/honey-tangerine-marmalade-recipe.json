Thinly slice the rind lengthwise, then roughly chop them crosswise into smaller pieces. Transfer the rind to a large pot and add 2 cups of water and the baking soda. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer until the rinds have softened, 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, coarsely chop the tangerines and remove any seeds. Transfer the tangerines to a food processor and pulse until the pieces are broken up but still chunky, about 8 pulses. Add the tangerines to the pot with the rind. Stir in the butter and pectin and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the sugar and the honey and return the mixture to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly. Boil hard for 1 minute.\nRemove the pot from the heat and skim any foam from the surface of the marmalade with a cold metal spoon. Ladle the marmalade into hot sterilized jars and process them in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.\nCondiments & Sauces\nJams & Jellies",
