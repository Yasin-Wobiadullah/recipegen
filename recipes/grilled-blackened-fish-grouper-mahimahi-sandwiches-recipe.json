When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of the charcoal grate to create a\ntwo-zone indirect fire\n. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean\nand\noil\ngrilling grate.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together paprika, oregano, thyme, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne. Season fish fillets all over with salt, then rub each all over with spice rub.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nCook fish on hot side of grill until undersides of fillets are darkened and a thin slotted fish spatula can be slid under with little resistance, about 4 minutes. Flip fish and repeat on other side. Transfer to cooler side of grill and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C), or until a cake tester can be inserted through center with no resistance. (The last trace of translucence in the center should just be disappearing when the fish is done.) Transfer fish to a platter to rest.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nToast buns on hot side of grill, then build sandwiches. Spread mayo (or tartar sauce or remoulade) on bottom and top buns; set fish fillets on bottom buns; top with lettuce and tomato (and bacon, if using); and close sandwiches. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n,\nchimney starter\n,\nslotted fish spatula\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nor cake tester\nNotes\nIf you don't have a grill, or don't want to fire one up, you can make this sandwich just as easily by broiling the fish, or searing it in a cast iron skillet.\nSerious Eats / Julia Hartbeck\nRead More\nHow to Shop for Sustainable Seafood\nHow to Grill Skinless Fish Fillets or Steaks\nFried Fish Sandwiches With Creamy Slaw and Tartar Sauce\nFish Po' Boys\nCrispy Curry Catfish Sandwich with Chili-Lime Slaw\nSandwiches\nGrilled Fish\nFish\nSeafood Mains\nQuick Dinners"
