Place the chicken wings in a large zip-top bag, then pour the marinade over the wings. Close the bag and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 1 hour, flipping the bag over halfway through.\nPreheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, then place a cooling rack into the foil-lined baking sheet. Drain the chicken and discard the marinade. Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels, then arrange the wings in a single layer on the rack in the baking sheet. Place the wings in the oven and bake until the skin is crisp and the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes.\nTo make the glaze\n, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the ginger and cook until very fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the chili pepper and stir in the remaining ginger beer and soy sauce, along with the honey. Bring to a boil and reduce, stirring often, until the sauce reduces by half and thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the glaze to a large bowl.\nAdd the baked wings to the large bowl with the glaze and toss to coat. Garnish with the green onions and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet fitted with a cooling rack\nChicken Wings\nDairy-free Mains\nRoasted Chicken\nGinger\nChicken Mains",
