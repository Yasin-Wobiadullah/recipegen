In a medium pot, add wheat berries and cover by at least 2 inches of cold water. Add enough salt to taste, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook until berries are tender with a pleasant chewiness, about 1 1/2 hours. Drain and set aside or place in refrigerator.\nPlace trimmed beet roots in a roasting pan, add a couple of tablespoons of water, and drizzle with enough olive oil to coat each beet root. Cover pan with aluminum foil and roast until beets are easily pierced by a fork or paring knife, about 1 hour. Let cool.\nPeel beets, trim ends, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. (The peels should rub off fairly easily with paper towels; if desired, wear latex gloves when peeling red beets to prevent staining fingers.) Set aside or place in refrigerator.\nMeanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 30 seconds. Add chopped beet greens and stems and cook, stirring often, until leaves are fully wilted and stalks are tender, about 10 minutes. Lower heat if necessary to prevent scorching. Season with salt. Set aside or place in refrigerator.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine white wine vinegar with 1 cup (235ml) water, sugar, 1 teaspoon (4g) kosher salt, and tarragon sprigs. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt.\nPlace apples and shallots in a stainless steel mixing bowl nested in a larger mixing bowl full of ice water. Pour hot vinegar brine over apples, stirring to chill rapidly. Once cool, discard tarragon and press a clean paper towel against the surface to fully submerge apples. Set aside or place in refrigerator for at least 1 hour.\nWhen ready to assemble, drain apples and shallots. Combine cooked wheat berries, diced beets, saut\u00e9ed beet greens, pickled apples and shallots, and toasted pecans in a large serving bowl. Toss well. Dress with enough vinaigrette to coat, drizzling on extra olive oil at any point to refresh salad if it appears dry. Season with salt and serve.\nTo Make Ahead:\nSalad components can each be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated separately until ready to combine and serve. This salad can also be assembled fully in advance, as it improves with time as the wheat berries absorb flavors from the dressing and other ingredients. If desired, assemble up to 3 days in advance and keep refrigerated. (Red beets will stain everything more if salad is assembled in advance, but otherwise there are no downsides.)\nSpecial equipment\nRoasting pan, stainless steel mixing bowl\nNotes\nWhole grains with their bran, like wheat berries, remain very chewy even when fully cooked; it's a pleasing texture, but if you want something more tender (and quicker-cooking), opt for polished grains, like farro or barley. For the nicest presentation, try to use a mix of beet colors, including red, yellow, and pink. If you can't find beets with their greens, use 2 1/2 pounds (1kg) beet roots and 8 ounces (225g) hearty leafy greens, like Swiss chard or kale.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMeet the Salad That Never Wilts: Make-Ahead Beet and Apple Grain Salad\nVegan Thanksgiving\nDairy-free Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nVegan Salads\nVegan Sides"
