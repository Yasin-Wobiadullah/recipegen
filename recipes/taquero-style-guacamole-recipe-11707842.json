Season to taste with additional salt as needed. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nA seeded jalape\u00f1o can be substituted for the serrano chile for an even less spicy option.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe guacamole sauce is best eaten the same day it's made. It should be refrigerated in an air-tight container when not in use (a squeeze bottle works great). Second-day leftovers still taste good, and light oxidation on top disappears with stirring. After that, the loss of flavor and color become increasingly noticeable.\nCondiments & Sauces\nThe Latest\nMexican\nAvocado",
