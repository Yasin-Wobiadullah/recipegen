Alternatively, combine bean cooking liquid and beans in a small saucepan, set over medium-high heat, and cook until both liquid and beans are steaming hot, 3 to 4 minutes.\nTransfer hot bean mixture to a blender jar, an immersion blender cup, or another tall-sided container that just fits the head of your immersion blender. Add fermented bean paste, oil, and vinegar, and blend until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Season with salt to taste, transfer 1/2 cup (120ml) of sauce to large mixing bowl, and set remaining sauce aside.\nAdd one portion of noodles to boiling water, and cook according to package directions or\nrecipe directions\n.\nWhen noodles are cooked, drain briefly in strainer or noodle basket, then add to bowl with sauce. Using tongs or chopsticks, immediately toss and stir noodles vigorously in the liquid at the bottom of the bowl, until the noodles are well-coated in sauce, about 30 seconds. Taste and adjust seasoning with more vinegar and salt to taste.\nTransfer dressed noodles to an individual serving bowl, and using a rubber spatula, scrape any remaining sauce over top. Garnish with sliced scallions and onsen egg (if using). (Other toppings, like leftover saut\u00e9ed or roasted vegetables; poached, roasted, or pan-seared meats; or even some additional cooked beans, can be added as they are available or desired, too.) Serve immediately.\nRepeat steps 4 through 6 with remaining portions of noodles and sauce, wiping out the mixing bowl between each round, and dressing each portion of noodles with 1/2 cup (120ml) of sauce.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge mixing bowl,\ntongs\nor cooking chopsticks, noodle basket or\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nThis dish tastes best when made with beans and bean cooking liquid from beans cooked from dry. If using canned beans, we recommend using low-sodium beans and stock so that you are better able to adjust seasoning levels yourself.\nThis recipe works with a wide variety of beans, including but not limited to, white beans (great Northern and cannellini), lima beans, cranberry beans, chickpeas, and scarlet runner beans (although scarlet runner beans don't produce the most visually appealing rendition of the dish).\nAny kind of oil or rendered fat can be used in this recipe, but a more flavorful fat, like toasted sesame oil,\nshallot oil\n, or rendered pork, chicken, or bacon fat, will yield a superior result. You can also use a blend of oils, such as a mix of olive oil, sesame oil, and unrefined peanut oil, to alter the flavor profile.\nYou can use either fresh or dried ramen noodles for this recipe. A single portion of fresh noodles weighs roughly 4 to 5 ounces (115 to 150g).\nThe onsen egg serves to temper the seasoning in this dish, and provide fat (in the form of the yolk) to lubricate the noodles further. A\npoached egg\nwould work just as well, as would a\nfried egg\nor even a raw egg yolk set on top of the noodles. If you would like to make this dish vegan, omit the egg and add an extra tablespoon of flavorful oil over the top of the noodles, before adding toppings.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nRamen\nBeans\nJapanese\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Noodles",
