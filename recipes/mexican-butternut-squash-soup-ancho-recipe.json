Toss squash with 2 tablespoons oil, season with salt, and spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast squash, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, about 35 minutes.\nIn a dry skillet, toast ancho chiles over high heat, turning once, until fragrant. Let cool, then tear into pieces.\nMeanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion, carrot, and garlic, and cook until softened and just starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add ancho chiles, chicken stock, and water and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to maintain simmer. Stir in butternut squash.\nUsing a countertop blender or immersion blender, blend soup until completely smooth. Season with salt and add sugar 1 teaspoon at a time to balance the flavor, if needed.\nSpoon soup into bowls and garnish with crema or sour cream, cilantro, and pepitas. Serve with lime wedges.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\ncountertop blender\nor\nimmersion blender\nNotes\nIf you want a less spicy soup with a less intense chile flavor, feel free to discard the ancho chile seeds or scale down to one ancho chile pepper. Otherwise, go for the big flavor and spoon in plenty of crema or sour cream to tame the intensity. You can make this soup vegetarian by substituting with vegetable stock.\nSoups\nMexican\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop\nButternut Squash",
