Cut all the chiles open along one side, so that they can be laid flat. Working in batches, cook chiles in the skillet, pressing down with a spatula, until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 seconds on each side; be careful not to let chiles burn. Transfer to a large bowl and cover chiles with hot water, setting a small plate on top to keep them submerged. Let stand 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Nick Kindelsperger\nMeanwhile, add ground beef to a cast iron skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl and set aside. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of beef fat from skillet; if there isn\u2019t enough fat leftover in the skillet, add enough oil to make up the difference. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in minced garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer onion and garlic to a blender.\nSerious Eats / Nick Kindelsperger\nDrain chiles, discarding all of the soaking liquid. Transfer chiles to the blender with onions and garlic, and add cumin, oregano, black pepper, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 cup chicken stock. Blend mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides with a spatula occasionally, about 1 to 2 minutes on high. If the mixture won\u2019t blend, add another 1/2 cup of stock.\nSerious Eats / Nick Kindelsperger\nUsing a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, press chili mixture through a mesh strainer set over a large bow until only chile skins remain in strainer. Discard skins.\nSerious Eats / Nick Kindelsperger\nHeat oil in cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add flour and stir immediately with a wire whisk. Continue to stir until roux turns light golden brown. Add chili mixture and stir in remaining broth and ground beef. Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a slow and steady simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is dark red and thick like a gravy, about 30 minutes. If too thick, add a little water to thin it out.\nSerious Eats / Nick Kindelsperger\nMeanwhile, for the Cheese Enchiladas\n: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working 1 tortilla at a time, carefully slide tortillas into oil and cook, turning once, until just starting to look leathery, about 5 to 10 seconds per side; avoid frying too long, as overly crisp tortillas will crack when folded. Transfer the fried tortilla to a paper towel-line plate to drain.\nSerious Eats / Nick Kindelsperger\nWorking 1 tortilla at a time, dip fried tortilla into sauce, then transfer to a plate. Arrange 1/4 cup of cheese and 1 tablespoon chopped onions in a line along center of tortilla, then roll up. Set rolled tortilla, seam-side down, in a 9-by-11-inch baking pan and repeat with remaining tortillas, cheese, and onion.\nSerious Eats / Nick Kindelsperger\nSpoon remaining sauce on top of enchiladas, followed by remaining cheese and onion. Transfer to the oven, and bake until cheese melts and just starts to bubble, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Nick Kindelsperger\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch\ncast iron skillet\n,\nblender\n, 9-by-11-inch baking pan, mesh strainer, whisk\nRead More\nTex-Mex Migas With Scrambled Eggs, Tortilla Chips, and Chiles\nMains\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nMexican\nStovetop\nCheddar Cheese"
