Once the syrup starts to bubble up and the sugar has completely dissolved, turn off heat and allow the syrup to steep while it cools down. (To speed up the cooling, you can place the saucepan in an ice bath.)\nPeel the oranges, including the one that has been zested, making sure the pith is entirely removed. Holding peeled orange in your hand, section it by cutting between one section of fruit and the membrane separating it from the next section into the center of the fruit. (See video\ndemonstration here\n). Divide the orange sections among 6 dessert bowls.\nPut crushed ice and cooled syrup into each bowl. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nFor best results, use tart oranges.\nThai\nOrange\nDesserts",
