Using your hands, swish potatoes until water turns cloudy, about 30 seconds. Using a colander, drain potatoes, discarding the cloudy soaking water. Return potatoes to bowl, refill with cool water, and repeat process until water runs clear.\nVicky Wasik\nTransfer drained potatoes to a 3-quart saucepan and add 2 quarts (1.9L) cold water and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until potatoes are tender and offer little resistance when pierced with a paring knife, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes in colander, then rinse with hot running water for 30 seconds to wash away excess starch.\nVicky Wasik\nReturn drained potatoes to now-empty saucepan. Heat on low heat, shaking saucepan constantly to evaporate moisture from potatoes, about 1 minute.\nVicky Wasik\nPass potatoes through a ricer onto a rimmed baking sheet, spreading them into an even layer, and allow them to cool slightly, about 2 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nTransfer riced potatoes to a medium bowl. Using a flexible spatula, stir in melted butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add choux pastry, and stir until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing plastic against surface of the potato-choux mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside (mixture can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours, or refrigerated for up to 8 hours and brought to room temperature before frying).\nVicky Wasik\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C). Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and line rack with paper towels. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat to 340\u00b0F (171\u00b0C). Using a 1-tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop dough and carefully add to hot oil, dropping portion from as close to the oil\u2019s surface as possible to minimize splashing. (Alternatively, using a spoon, scoop roughly 1-tablespoon of dough, and using a second spoon, gently form into a rough, oblong shape, then carefully add to hot oil). Working quickly, repeat process with 9 more portions of dough (for a batch of 10). Fry, using a spider or slotted spoon to turn pieces as they cook, until puffed and golden brown on all sides, about 3 1/2 minutes. Transfer pommes dauphine to prepared wire rack, season with salt, and transfer to oven to keep warm.\nVicky Wasik\nReturn oil to 340\u00b0F (171\u00b0C) and repeat frying with remaining dough, continuing to work in batches of 10. Transfer pommes dauphine to a serving bowl and serve immediately.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nPotato ricer\nor\npotato masher\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\n,\ncolander\n,\nspider skimmer\nor\nslotted spoon\n,\nDutch oven\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n, 1 tablespoon cookie scoop\nNotes\nThis recipe uses a 1/2 recipe of\nchoux pastry\n. To do this, you can either cut the ingredients in half and proceed with the recipe as directed, or make a whole recipe, using the remaining half to make\nParis\u2013Brest\n,\n\u00e9clairs\n, or\nchoux au craquelin\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPommes dauphine are best enjoyed immediately.\nPotatoes\nFrying\nThe Latest",
