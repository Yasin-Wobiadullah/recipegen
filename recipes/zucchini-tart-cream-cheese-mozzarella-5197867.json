Transfer zucchini to prepared baking sheet and spread evenly over towels; discard accumulated liquid and wipe out bowl. Use additional paper towels or a second clean kitchen towel to blot zucchini, ridding them of as much excess moisture as possible. Return zucchini to now empty bowl and set aside. Discard paper towels used to line rimmed baking sheet; line now empty baking sheet with parchment.\n[Photograph: Debbie Wee].\nDebbie Wee\nOn a lightly floured surface, place one sheet of puff pastry directly on top of the other. Using a rolling pin, roll pastry into a 11- by 15-inch rectangle. Transfer pastry to prepared baking sheet. Poke pastry all over with a fork. Cover the pastry with a sheet of parchment and place another rimmed baking sheet on top. Bake until pastry is pale and firm to the touch, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and remove the top baking sheet and parchment. Increase oven temperature to 445\u00b0F (230\u00b0C).\n[Photograph: Debbie Wee].\nDebbie Wee\nIn a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, Dijon mustard, thyme, and garlic (if using) and stir together until well combined. Using an offset spatula, spread cream cheese mixture in an even layer over puff pastry, leaving a 1/2-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella.\n[Photograph: Debbie Wee].\nDebbie Wee\nAdd olive oil to bowl with reserved zucchini and toss to coat.
