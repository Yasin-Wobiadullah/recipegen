Meanwhile, place meat and bacon chunks on rimmed baking sheet, leaving space between each piece and place in freezer for 10 minutes until meat is firm, but not frozen.

On well-floured work surface, divide dough into 6 to 8 even pieces (depending on if you want large or small buns) and shape each into a ball. Place on greased baking sheet about 2 inches apart and flatten slightly with palm of well-floured hand. Spray with non-stick spray, cover with plastic, and let rest 15 minutes until slightly risen. Meanwhile, whisk egg white until slightly frothy.\nBake buns for 4 minutes. remove from oven, brush with egg white, and return to oven until golden brown and well-risen, about 4-8 minutes longer. Set on wire rack to cool.\nSlice buns. Brush lightly with bacon fat or butter (or leave plain), then place under broiler or in toaster oven until golden brown, about 1 minute. Cook patties in well-seasoned cast-iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until well-browned and crisp on first side, about 2-3 minutes. Flip patties and cook on second side until cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer patties to burger bun bottoms, top with bacon, spread burger bun tops with baconnaise, close sandwiches, and serve.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Burger Lab: Bacon Attack!\nBurgers",
