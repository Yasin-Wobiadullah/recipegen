Add the onion, season with a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is very soft and golden and the sausage is well browned, about 7 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nStir in the flour until no dry bits remain, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nStir in 2 tablespoons of milk until completely absorbed. Gradually pour in remaining milk while stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the gravy to a simmer and cook, stirring and scraping the sides and bottom of the skillet, until a silky and thick, spoon-coating sauce forms, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and a generous amount of black pepper.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nServe warm biscuits with hot gravy spooned over top.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch cast iron skillet\nNotes\nThis recipe is also delicious with these yogurt-based\nlight and fluffy biscuits\n.\nTo warm up pre-baked biscuits, preheat your oven to 300\u00baF (150\u00baC) 30 minutes before you plan to make the sausage gravy. When you start making the gravy, place the biscuits on a rimmed baking sheet. Reheat in the oven while you prepare the gravy.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis is best eaten right away while the biscuits are warm and the gravy is hot off the stovetop. The gravy will thicken as it cools.\nPork\nThe Latest\nBreakfast & Brunch\nQuick Breakfast\nStovetop Pork",
