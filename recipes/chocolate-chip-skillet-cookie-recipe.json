Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, malted milk powder, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With mixer running, add egg and continue beating only until smooth. Stop mixer and add flour all at once; quickly and carefully switch mixer speed between off setting and stir setting just until flour mixture is nearly combined into butter mixture. Add\u00a0 chopped chocolate, then mix on low speed to form a stiff dough.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nGenerously butter a 10-inch cast iron skillet, then fill with cookie dough and press into an even layer. Bake until slightly puffed, edges are set and\u00a0 golden brown, and center is just set but still feels soft underneath when touched, about 45 minutes, loosely covering cookie with aluminum foil after 20 to 25 minutes to prevent excess browning if needed. (An instant-read thermometer inserted in center should register 180\u00b0F [82\u00b0C] to 185\u00b0F [85\u00b0C].) Cool until crumb is set, about 1 hour, before serving. (Center may sink slightly as cookie cools.) Enjoy warm or cover with foil when cool and store up to 3 days at room temperature. Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nflexible spatula\n,\n10-inch cast iron skillet\nNotes\nLook for malted milk powder from brands like Carnation and Ovaltine next to hot cocoa at the supermarket, or buy it in bulk online; my favorite brand is Hoosier Hill Farm.\nRead More\nQuick and Easy Chocolate Chip Cookies\nMalted Chocolate Chip-Pecan Cookies\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Cookie Styles\nCookies\nBaking\nChocolate"
