Over medium heat, stir and swirl the spices until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer whole spices to a spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. Empty into a small bowl and combine with turmeric, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Poached Chicken:\nIn a large saucepan, combine water and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon (15g) salt and stir to dissolve. Add chicken and set over medium-high heat until water temperature reaches between 150 and 160\u00b0F (65-71\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer; adjust heat to maintain water temperature in the 150\u2013160\u00b0F range. (It's okay if the temperature bounces around a little, but try to keep it above 150 and below 170\u00b0F/77\u00b0C.) Cook until thickest part of chicken registers 150\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Shred chicken and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Chicken Salad:\nIn a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, apricot preserves, Madras spice blend, and 1 teaspoon (4g) salt.

This fragrant spice has a rich and nutty flavor that is similar to maple syrup.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nMadras spice blend can be made in advance and stored in an airtight container for up to 3 months at cool room temperature. Store away from light and heat.\nRefrigerate chicken salad in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nRead More\nPesto Chicken Salad Recipe\nThe Best Classic Chicken Salad Sandwich Recipe\nChicken Salad With Avocado, Corn, & Miso Dressing Recipe\nG\u1ecfi G\u00e0 B\u1eafp C\u1ea3i (Vietnamese Chicken and Cabbage Salad) Recipe\nChicken Salad\nChicken Breast\nPoached Chicken\nThe Latest",
