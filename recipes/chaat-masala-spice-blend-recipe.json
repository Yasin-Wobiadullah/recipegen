If using a spice grinder with a limited capacity, grind each ingredient in batches, then thoroughly combine in a small mixing bowl.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStore masala in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 3 months. The masala's flavor is best the day after making, once the spices have had a chance to mingle.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nHigh-powered blender\n,\nspice grinder\n, or\nmortar and pestle\n;\nskillet\nNotes\nKashmiri red chile powder is mild and fruity.
