Preheat a four-well Belgian waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray with non-stick cooking spray and add 1 cup of stuffing to each well. Close waffle iron and cook, turning occasionally, until cooked through and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Set waffles aside.\nWhile waffles bake, make the gravy cheese sauce. Heat gravy in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, whisking frequently, until simmering. Remove from heat and whisk in 6 ounces of cheese. Continue whisking until completely smooth. For a glossier sauce, blend with a hand blender until shiny, about 1 minute. Keep warm.\nPlace the waffles in a large oven-safe skillet or on a foil-lined broiler pan. Top with sliced turkey. Ladle half of cheese sauce over turkey, followed by remaining grated cheese. Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 3 minutes.\nMeanwhile, fry the eggs. Melt the butter in a large cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the eggs and cook until whites are cooked through but yolks are still liquid, about 2 minutes.\nTop broiled turkey waffles with fried eggs, ladle remaining gravy over the whites of the eggs, season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with herbs, and serve immediately.\nJ.
