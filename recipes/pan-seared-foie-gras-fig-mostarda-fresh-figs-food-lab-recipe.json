Reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer and cook until reduced and syrupy, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside until cool. Season with a pinch of salt.\nFor the Foie Gras\n: Lay a double layer of paper towels on top of a plate or cutting board and set aside. Season foie gras liberally on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet over high heat for at least 3 minutes. Place foie gras in skillet scored-side-down. It should immediately start smoking, sizzling, and rendering fat. If it doesn't, remove and allow the pan to preheat for another 1 to 2 minutes. Once all four pieces of foie are in skillet, cook, swirling pan gently every few seconds, until deeply browned and crisp on first side, about 30 seconds. Use a thin metal spatula to flip foie gras onto second side and cook for 30 second longer. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate and let rest for 1 minute.\nUse a small spoon to glaze each piece of foie gras with syrup from fig mostarda. Spoon some of the fig mostarda onto four individual serving plates and place 1 slice of foie gras on each. Top with chives, coarse sea salt, and fresh fig slices. Serve immediately with lightly dressed greens.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: How to Pan Sear Foie Gras\nSerious Entertaining: A Blowout Christmas Dinner\nOther Meat & Poultry\nStovetop\nFig",
