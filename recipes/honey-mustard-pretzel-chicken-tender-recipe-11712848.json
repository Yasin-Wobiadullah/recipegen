Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper, then set a wire rack in baking sheet. Spray rack with cooking spray and set aside.\nFor the Chicken:\nPat chicken tenders dry with paper towels and season evenly with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Set aside while you prepare the dredge.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpread flour in a shallow dish. In a second shallow dish, whisk mustard, mayonnaise, honey, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt until well combined. Transfer 1/2 cup sauce to a small serving bowl, cover, and set aside in refrigerator.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nAdd pretzels to the bowl of a food processor. Process until mostly finely ground with some larger pieces remaining, about 20 seconds. (Alternatively, add pretzels to a large, heavy-duty resealable bag, press out the air, seal, and use a rolling pin to crush pretzels into fine crumbs. Note that some pretzels may break through the bag.)\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nTransfer pretzel crumbs to a third shallow dish (you should have about 2 cups). Add oil and use fingers to toss until crumbs are evenly coated in oil.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nWorking with one chicken tender at a time, dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip chicken in honey-mustard sauce, let excess drip off, then dredge in pretzel crumbs, pressing gently to help crumbs adhere; transfer chicken to greased rack set in baking sheet. Repeat the process with remaining tenders, then discard remaining flour, sauce, and crumbs.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nFor Cooking in the Oven:\nBake tenders until golden brown, pretzel coating is crunchy, and internal temperature reaches 160\u00b0F (75\u00b0C), 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter and let rest for 5 minutes.\nFor Cooking in the Air Fryer:\nLightly spray the cooking basket of a 6-quart air fryer with cooking spray. Transfer half of prepared tenders to greased air-fryer basket and cook at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 160\u00b0F (70\u00b0C) and pretzel coating is crunchy, 12 to 18 minutes. Repeat with remaining tenders. Let second batch of tenders rest for 5 minutes.\nServe chicken tenders with reserved honey-mustard sauce for dipping.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet, wire rack, aluminum foil or parchment paper, food processor or large resealable bag and rolling pin, instant-read thermometer\nNotes\nYou can use pre-prepped chicken tenders (labeled as tenderloins or tenders) or make your own tenders from boneless, skinless chicken breasts. To do so, first remove the tenderloins from the breasts, then cut the breasts lengthwise into 2 to 3 strips of similar thickness (about 2 to 3 ounces; 57 to 85 g each). You should end up with about 8 pieces of chicken.\nMake sure to use thin pretzel sticks or thin mini twists, not thick pretzel rods or larger sourdough pretzels, in this recipe.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe honey-mustard mayonnaise can be made ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nThe chicken tenders can be frozen, uncooked, for up to 1 month. To freeze, dredge the chicken tenders as directed through the end of step 6, then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze until firm, at least 1 hour, then transfer to a resealable bag or container.\nTo cook from frozen, bake desired number of tenders directly from frozen, increasing time to 30 to 35 minutes, or cook in the air fryer as directed in recipe, increasing cooking time to 22 to 27 minutes.\nChicken Mains\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nAir Fryer Recipes",
