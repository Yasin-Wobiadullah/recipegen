Pour chicken stock into a medium bowl and sprinkle gelatin evenly all over surface, allowing each packet's worth of gelatin to soak up stock before sprinkling next one on. Set aside.\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with 3 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet.\nLower heat to medium; add split carrots, halved onion, and garlic to Dutch oven and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.\nAdd brandy, if using, and boil until alcohol has nearly cooked off, about 2 minutes. (If not using brandy, proceed with next step.)\nScrape chicken stock and\u00a0 gelatin mixture into Dutch oven. Add red wine, fish sauce, soy sauce, and bouquet garni and bring to a simmer over medium high, then lower heat to medium to maintain simmer. Meanwhile, cut beef into 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add flour and stir until beef is evenly coated in a floury paste. Add beef and any accumulated juices to Dutch oven. Bring back to a simmer then transfer to oven, partially cover with a lid, and cook until beef starts to become tender, about 2 hours.\nMeanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, cook bacon lardons over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and lardons are lightly browned and crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lardons to a plate.\nAdd mushrooms to skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their liquid and browned, about 10 minutes; add oil as needed if pan becomes too dry. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\nRemove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard large pieces of carrot and onion. Discard bouquet garni. Using a ladle, skim off and discard accumulated fat on surface. Add reserved lardons and saut\u00e9ed carrots, onions, and mushrooms to stew, return to oven, and continue to cook, uncovered, until beef is fork tender, pearl onions are soft but still hold their shape, and sauce is nappe, about 1 hour.\nRemove stew from oven. If serving right away, skim off any additional fat from surface. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow to cool slightly before serving, then serve topped with parsley. If making ahead, cool down stew, then chill in refrigerator; remove solid fat cap from surface once fully chilled. Reheat stew on the stovetop or in a low oven.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nIf you're using smoked bacon and you want to decrease the smokiness of it slightly, blanch the lardons in boiling water for two minutes, then drain and use as directed.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nThe stew can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nRead More\nWhat Are the Best Cuts of Beef for Stew?\nThe Truth About Cooking With Wine\nBeef Mains\nFrench\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nBeef Chuck\nWinter Mains"
