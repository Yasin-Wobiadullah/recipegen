Cut the butter into several pieces and add it to the bowl. Using a pastry cutter or two knives cut the butter into the flour until the largest pieces are no larger than a pea. Add the blueberries and stir to combine, then the milk. Stir just enough to moisten all the flour.\nTurn dough out onto a floured work surface. Shape it into a rough rectangle. Flour the top and roll to a rectangle roughly 12- by 9-inches and 1/4 inch thick. Fold in thirds crosswise like a letter. Rotate dough 90 degrees. Flour the work surface and dough as needed and roll into a rectangle again. Fold in thirds again. Roll once more into a rectangle roughly 9- by 6-inches and 3/4-inch thick.\nUsing a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut as many rounds from the dough as you can, cutting straight down without twisting the cutter. Place them on the prepared baking sheet.\nGather the scraps, trying not to turn any of the pieces sideways (this keeps the layers running horizontally) and flatten to the same 3/4-inch thickness. Cut as many pieces as possible again. Gather the scraps again. Usually I make the last biscuit or two free-form. They're not as pretty, but that's fine for sampling.\nBrush the tops of the biscuits with a little bit of milk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 425\u00b0F in the center of the oven until the biscuits are light golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove the biscuits from the oven and place on a rack to cook just for a moment before serving.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nBiscuits\nBlueberry"
