Strain soup through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Serve, drizzling each bowl with olive oil, a few sprinkles of sherry vinegar, extra cracked black pepper, and chives.

You want it to soften and blend into the soup completely.\nYou can serve the soup as is with a drizzle of olive oil, sherry vinegar, and a sprinkle of chives and ground black pepper, or you can add a few diced vegetables back to the smooth base for texture.\nRead More\nEasy Gazpacho Recipe\nAjo Blanco (Spanish Chilled \"White Gazpacho\" Bread and Almond Soup) Recipe\nWatermelon Gazpacho With Calabrian-Chili Crema Recipe\nSerious Entertaining: A Light, All-Chilled Spanish(ish) Menu\nSoups\nSummer Snacks & Appetizers\nSpanish\nTomato\nSummer Mains",
