  "full_text": "Homemade Butterfingers Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nTotal\n65 mins\nServes\n10 candy bars\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nounces\nwater\n1 1/4\nounces\nmolasses\n1\nounce\ncorn syrup\n8\nounces\nsugar\n1\nvanilla bean\n, split and scraped\n8\nounces\nroasted, salted peanuts\n2\nounces\npowdered sugar\n1/2\nounce\ncorn flakes\n40\nounces\nchocolate\n, divided\nDirections\nPrepare the candy:\nLine a jelly roll pan (a 1/2 sheet pan) with a silicon mat and preheat oven to 200\u00b0 F.\nIn a medium pot, combine water, molasses, corn syrup, sugar and vanilla bean seeds. Set over medium heat and stir gently with a fork, taking care not to splash, until sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer. Simmer, undisturbed, until the mixture reaches between 280 and 290\u00b0F on a candy thermometer. Due to the molasses, the mixture will have a sketchy burning smell, but remain within the recommended temperatures and rest assured that it\u2019s not actually burning. Cooking molasses just smells funky.\nWhile the syrup is cooking, grind the peanuts and powdered sugar together in a food processor until the mixture forms a thick, damp mass with a texture like wet sand. Set aside.\nWhen the syrup comes to temperature, immediately pour the mixture onto the silicon mat in the sheet pan, taking care to keep the syrup within the center of the mat. Wearing a pair of oven mitts, tilt the pan left and right to help the syrup evenly coat the silicon mat into a roughly 14\u201d by 10\u201d rectangular shape.\nYou can fold the candy back over on itself if any places flow out too far.\nLayer the candy:\nIf you\u2019ve ever laminated dough, this will be a familiar process; if not, imagine this next step as folding a business letter in thirds.\nSprinkle the ground peanut mixture in an even a layer over 2/3 of the candy.\nUse the silicon mat to fold the unsprinkled section up and over the center of the candy, just like the first fold of a business letter. If the candy sticks to the silicon, it\u2019s still too hot. Wait a few moments for it to cool, then peel the silicon away; no rush. Now fold this double-thick section up and over the remaining piece. You will now have a 3 layer candy packet roughly 11\u201d x 5\u201d.\nPlace the sheet pan in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or until the candy has become warm and pliable. Remove it from the oven and lift out the silicon mat, setting it on the counter. Use a rolling pin to gently roll it out to a 14\u201d x 10\u201d rectangle; it will take some elbow grease. If at any time the candy begins to make a cracking sound, or feels too stiff to roll, return the pan to the oven for a minute or two. Take your time! Once you\u2019ve rolled it out, fold it into thirds again just as you did the first time.\nReturn the candy to the oven for another 4 minutes, then roll back out to a 14\u201d x 10\u201d rectangle. Sprinkle this rectangle with corn flakes, as you did with the peanut mixture. Fold into thirds (if, while folding the candy makes a cracking noise, stop folding and return it to the oven for about a minute, then proceed with folding). Return folded packet to the oven for another 4 minutes.\nCut the candy into bars:\nNow roll the candy to 1/2\u201d thickness and then transfer to a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to trim the edges, leaving a tidy rectangle behind. You may be able to immediately cut the candy into 10 long, thin bars. But you may find you need to return it to the oven for a minute or two. This generally depends on the temperature of the kitchen.\nCrumb coat the bars:\nDue to the extreme flakiness of the candy, it\u2019s important to \u201ccrumb coat\u201d the candy bars before dipping in chocolate. Do this by tempering 12 ounces of chocolate. Drizzle or pipe a thin line of chocolate onto the bottom of each candy piece and then flip each over to form a foot on the bottom. Next, drizzle a little chocolate over each bar and use a small pastry brush to evenly coat the bar in a thin layer of chocolate.\nDipping the bars:\nOnce the chocolate has set, temper the remaining chocolate and dip each bar. Store the finished bars in an airtight container, indefinitely.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor, candy thermometer, silicon mat\nNotes\nAll measurements are in weights, as volume measures can be very imprecise. I strongly recommend using a scale for all pastry projects. Serious Eats' recommended kitchen scale is the Oxo Good Grips Scale with Pull Out Display.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBraveTart: Make Your Own Butterfingers\nDairy-free Desserts\nGluten-free Desserts\nVegan Desserts\nChocolate\nPeanuts"
