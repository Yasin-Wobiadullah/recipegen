Place cauliflower on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast until golden brown on one side, about 10 minutes. Turn and roast until brown on second side and just tender, 7 to 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven and set aside.\nIn a large cast iron skillet or stainless steel saut\u00e9 pan, heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, cinnamon stick, cloves, and star anise and cook, stirring, until onions are soft and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, chile flakes, garam masala, ground almonds, and 1/2 cup (120ml) water. Cook, stirring often, until water is absorbed and ground almonds begin to look and smell toasted, about 5 minutes.\nStir in yogurt, stock, cream, raisins, and brown sugar. Season lightly with salt, then lower heat and simmer until sauce thickens to a creamy glaze, about 10 minutes. (If it gets too thick, stir in a little more water or stock.) Stir in roasted cauliflower and toss until cauliflower is warmed through and coated in sauce, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove cinnamon stick pieces and star anise. Transfer to a warmed serving dish and scatter with toasted slivered almonds and cilantro. Serve with\nraita\n, rice, and/or Indian flatbreads.\nSpecial equipment\nRimmed baking sheet,\nlarge cast iron skillet\nor\nstainless steel saut\u00e9 pan\nNotes\nFeel free to use either standard white cauliflower or, if you can find it, the orange variety pictured here.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThis Creamy Indian-Spiced Cauliflower Is Light Enough for Summer\nIndian\nGluten-free Mains\nGluten-free Sides\nVegetarian Mains\nVegetarian Sides"
