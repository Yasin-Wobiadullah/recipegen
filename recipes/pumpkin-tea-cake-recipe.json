Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nSift or whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.\nIn another bowl, beat together the pumpkin puree, oil, sugar, and salt on medium speed (or by hand--that's how I did it) until well mixed. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. On low speed, add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Scrape down the sides again, then beat on medium speed for 5 to 10 seconds to make a smooth batter. The batter should have the consistency of a thick pur\u00e9e. Make sure not to overmix, or you will end up with a coarse, tough crumb.\nTransfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the top evenly with half the topping sugar, then the optional pepitas, and then the rest of the topping sugar. Bake until a tester emerges clean from the center, about 1 hour (I left mine in a bit longer, and it was still ever so slightly underbaked).\nLet cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 20 minutes. Then invert the cake onto the rack, turn right side up, and let cool completely. Serve at room temperature. The cake will keep, well wrapped, at room temperature for 4 days or in the refrigerator for about 1 week.\nCakes\nPumpkin\nBreakfast & Brunch\nTeas"
