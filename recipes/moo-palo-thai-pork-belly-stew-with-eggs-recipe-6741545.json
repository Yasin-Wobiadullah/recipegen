Add sugar and continue to pound into a mostly fine paste (some larger pieces are okay), about 1 minute. Stir in vinegar, transfer to a small bowl, and set aside. Wipe out mortar and pestle.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Stew:\nIn now-empty mortar and pestle, add peppercorns and pound until fine, about 20 seconds. Add coriander roots, garlic, and salt and continue to pound until a fine paste has formed, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a Dutch oven, heat oil over high heat until shimmering. Add pork belly and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer pork belly to a medium bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReduce heat to low. Add palm sugar and cook, stirring and scraping bottom occasionally, until caramelized and deep golden brown, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStir in cinnamon sticks, star anise, five-spice powder, and reserved pepper-coriander paste and cook until the aroma is released, about 15 seconds; you may need to move the pan off the heat to avoid burning the sugar. Return pork belly to pot and stir until thoroughly coated with the caramelized sugar sauce, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd 10 cups (2.3L) water and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, skim any scum that accumulates on the surface, then stir in fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and black soy sauce. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the pork is tender, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Remove from heat and add eggs, stirring to make sure they\u2019re fully coated in the sauce. Cover and let stand to allow eggs to absorb sauce, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe immediately with dipping sauce and cooked jasmine rice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nGranite mortar and pestle, Dutch oven\nNotes\nThe roots of fresh coriander (a.k.a. cilantro) provide a slight herbal note to curry pastes, but are unfortunately hard to find in the US, as they are often cut off from the stems before going to market (though local farmers markets in the summer and fall often have coriander with the roots still attached). Coriander roots can also be found at Southeast Asian markets. If you can't find the herb with the roots still attached, you can either use the tender stems, which won't make too much of a difference in this particular curry, or omit it altogether. And, to clarify, although they are called coriander \"roots,\" Thai cooks usually also use some of the tender green stem.\nIf you can't find palm sugar, you can substitute with brown sugar.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nMoo palo can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. In fact, it tastes better when made ahead of time and allowed to sit in the refrigerator. To reheat, you can warm it in the microwave or on the stovetop over medium-low heat.\nThai\nPork Belly\nSoups\nThe Latest",
