Add chicken to the buttermilk mixture and turn to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nWhen ready to fry, set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk mixture, allowing excess to drip off into the bowl, and set chicken on the prepared baking sheet.\nWhisk eggs into the buttermilk mixture. In a baking dish or pie plate, whisk flour, cornstarch, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, baking powder, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt until combined.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWorking with 1 chicken thigh at a time, dredge in flour mixture, turning to thoroughly coat and pressing to adhere, then shake off excess flour mixture. Dip chicken back into reserved buttermilk mixture, let excess drip back into the bowl, then dredge in the flour mixture a second time, turning and pressing to coat evenly. Return to wire rack and repeat with remaining chicken thighs. Let chicken rest on wire rack for about 15 minutes until ready to fry.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nMeanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200\u00b0F (90\u00b0C). Set a clean wire rack in a clean rimmed baking sheet and line wire rack with a triple layer of paper towels; set aside. Add oil to a large Dutch oven or pot until it measures about 2 inches deep. Heat oil over medium-high heat to 350\u2109 (175\u00b0C). Carefully add 3 chicken pieces and fry, flipping chicken halfway through frying, until chicken is golden brown and registers 175\u2109 (80\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 8 to 12 minutes. (Adjust heat as needed to maintain oil temperature between 325 to 350\u2109.) Transfer chicken to prepared paper towel\u2013lined rack and transfer to oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining chicken thighs. Measure and reserve 1/2 cup hot frying oil.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nFor the Sauce:\nIn a large heatproof bowl, combine butter, cayenne, brown sugar, onion powder, salt, paprika, chile powder, and black pepper. Pour reserved 1/2 cup hot frying oil over mixture and whisk vigorously until combined and butter is melted.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nBrush 1/3 cup butter sauce over top of chicken; reserve remaining sauce for serving.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nFor Serving:\nSpread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise evenly on each bun bottom. Place chicken on bun bottoms, then top with pickles and bun tops. Serve with remaining hot sauce.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nSpecial Equipment\nClip-on or digital instant-read thermometer, large Dutch oven or large sauce pot\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nChicken\nFried Chicken"
