Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Continue cooking until most of the cranberries have popped and the mixture looks rather jammy, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, set aside until needed, up to 3 hours at room temperature. Remove orange peel and cinnamon stick before using.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Whipped Mascarpone:\nCombine mascarpone, cream, maple syrup, cinnamon, salt, and cloves in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix at low speed to start, then increase to high and whip until the mixture is thick and stiff, about 5 minutes. Use immediately, or cover and refrigerate up to 2 days; if needed, briefly rewhip before use to restore its consistency.\nTo Assemble:\nScatter a layer of cubed angel food cake along the bottom of a trifle dish or large bowl, then sprinkle generously with Cardamaro (or an alternative of your choosing). Cover with a thin layer of cranberry jam, followed by a thick layer of whipped mascarpone. Repeat until the dish is full. Bring to the table immediately, or cover and refrigerate up to 6 hours before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nEnameled\nDutch oven\n,\nheat-resistant spatula\n, trifle dish\nNotes\nIn place of an elderflower liquor like St. Germain, try an equal amount of cr\u00e8me de violette,\nchrysanthemum honey liquor\n, or even apple juice doctored with a 1/2 teaspoon of rosewater.\nIn place of Cardamaro, try using another bittersweet amaro, or else more traditional options like brandy and rum. For a non-alcoholic version, try using a scented tea like Earl Grey or else an herbal tisane such as chamomile.\nDesserts\nThanksgiving Desserts\nFall Desserts\nWinter Desserts\nThanksgiving"
