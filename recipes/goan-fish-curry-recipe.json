Set aside. Heat oil in a large heavy-bottomed lidded saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add the curry leaves and chiles and stir till they splutter and release their aroma, about 15 seconds. Reduce heat to medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the spice paste and keep stirring from time to time until it releases an aroma and the oil begins to float on top, about 5 minutes. Add water, stir, close the lid and bring the curry to the boil. Once boiled, check seasoning and add salt if needed. Reduce heat to low and slide in the fish fillets until they are totally immersed in the curry. Let the fish cook gently for 5 minutes without stirring. Serve immediately with steamed white rice.\nSpecial Equipment\nHeavy-bottomed saucepan with lid\nIndian\nDairy-free Mains\nStovetop Seafood\nFish\nSeafood Mains",
