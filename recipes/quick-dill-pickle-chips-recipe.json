Heat water, vinegar, salt, pepper flakes, garlic, black peppercorns, mustard seeds, and dill in a skillet over high heat until salt has dissolved and mixture is simmering. Immediately pour brine over cucumbers. Cover bowl with a paper towel pressed directly against the surface of the liquid to keep cucumbers submerged. Wait at least 30 minutes before serving (do not drain brine). Pickles can be stored in their brine in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a month.\nNotes\nThis recipe can easily be scaled up; just make enough brine to fully submerge the cucumbers you're pickling. It will also work with other vegetables, like green beans, snap peas, and carrots.\nThe salt-to-liquid ratio called for here will produce a salty pickle that's a great foil for meaty burgers. For milder pickles, reduce the salt by half.\nRead More\nMilwaukee Dill Refrigerator Pickles\nGarlic Dill Pickles\nQuick-Pickled Cucumbers With Rice Vinegar\n12 Refrigerator Pickle Recipes to Get the Most Out of Your Vegetables\nPickling\nCucumbers\nSnacks & Appetizers"
