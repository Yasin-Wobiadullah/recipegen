Add beans, cover, and let stand overnight at room temperature. Drain and rinse beans.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nPlace a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add bacon and cook until fat has rendered and bacon has crisped, 7-10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving as much fat in Dutch oven as possible.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nAdd onion to Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion softens and begins to brown around the edges, about 7 minutes. Stir in green pepper, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 3 cups of water, chicken stock, reserved bacon, and beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) while beans are simmering.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nStir in ketchup, brown sugar, honey, molasses, mustard, vinegar, barbecue rub, and hot sauce. Cover and transfer to oven. Cook beans for 4 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove cover and cook until beans are tender throughout and sauce has thickened, about 1 hour longer. Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes. Season with salt. Serve immediately; alternatively, store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or freeze. Reheat before serving.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nYou can use a single variety of bean or combine several.\nRead More\nSmoky Barbecue Beans\nHow to Cook Dried Beans\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Beans\nBrining Beans With Baking Soda: An Investigation\nBraised & Stewed Beans\nDairy-free Sides\nStovetop Beans\nBeans Sides"
