Add potatoes, kosher salt, 1 tablespoon (12g) sugar, and 2 tablespoons (28g) vinegar. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Spread into even layer, then sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon (14g) vinegar.\nIn large saucepan, combine ghee (or oil) and onion and cook over medium-high heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove onions and set aside, then return ghee to pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and chana dal, cooking until dal is toasted, about 5 minutes. Add turmeric, red chile, asafetida, green chile, and cashews and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add cooked potatoes, remaining 1 tablespoon (12g) sugar, cilantro, browned onions, and 3/4 cup (180ml) water. Simmer until filling ingredients have combined and a light sauce has formed. Add salt to taste.\nCooking the Dosa:\nPreheat 10-inch cast iron griddle over medium heat. (If your griddle is well seasoned, then no cooking oil will be necessary; if it's not, add 1 teaspoon/5ml neutral oil to the griddle once it's preheated.) Using 1/4-cup measure or 2-ounce ladle, pour batter onto center of griddle. Using bottom of the measuring cup or ladle, spread batter, using circular motions, until it thinly covers entire griddle bottom. Cook until surface of dosa is just set, about 1 minute. Brush or drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15ml) melted ghee. Continue cooking until bottom of dosa is golden brown and edges are crisp, about 4 minutes longer. Top each dosa with 1/2 cup of warm potato masala. Roll each dosa and serve right away with coconut chutney.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRound cast iron griddle,\nrimmed baking sheet\n, large saucepan\nRead More\nDosa (Indian Rice and Lentil Crepes)\nParatha (Flaky South Asian Flatbread)\nCucumber Raita (Indian Yogurt)\nIndian\nGluten-free Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop\nLentils"
