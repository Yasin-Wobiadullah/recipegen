  "full_text": "Quick and Easy Vegetable Stock Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nTotal\n20 mins\nServes\n16 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nmedium\ncarrots\n, peeled and roughly diced\n4\nstalks\ncelery\n, roughly diced\n2\nlarge\nonions\n, roughly diced\n4\nmedium\ncloves garlic\n, smashed\nSprigs of fresh parsley, thyme, and/or a dried\nbay leaf\nDirections\nFill a large pot with 4 quarts of water and add carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and herbs. Bring to a low boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and let cook for at least 20 minutes and up to 40 minutes. Strain and use as needed.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot\nNotes\nIn this recipe, the specific vegetables used and the amounts called for don't need to be strictly followed. Carrots, onion, and garlic, at the very least, are needed. Celery is good to add, as are leeks and fennel if you have them. No need to measure the water exactly, either: Just cover the aromatic vegetables with a generous amount, and this stock will come out fine.\nSoups\nVegetables",
