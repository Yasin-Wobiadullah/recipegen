With mixer running, add eggs one at a time, letting each incorporate fully before adding the next. Reduce speed to low, then add the flour all at once. When flour is incorporated, add chocolate chips and nuts and keep mixing until dough is homogeneous.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDivide dough into 8 equal portions (about 6 ounces/170g each) and round each into a smooth ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 12 hours before baking; if well protected from air, the dough can be kept in the fridge up to 1 week (see Make-Ahead and Storage).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Bake:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line an aluminum half-sheet pan with parchment paper. When the oven comes to temperature, arrange up to 4 portions of cold dough on prepared pan, leaving ample space between them to account for spread. If you like, sprinkle with additional salt to taste.\nBake until cookies are puffed and lightly brown, about 22 minutes, or to an internal temperature of between 175 and 185\u00b0F (79 and 85\u00b0C). The ideal temperature will vary from person to person; future rounds can be baked more or less to achieve desired consistency.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCool cookies directly on baking sheet until no warmer than 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) before serving. Enjoy warm, or within 12 hours; these cookies taste best when freshly baked (see Make-Ahead and Storage).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\ndigital thermometer\n(optional)\nNotes\nThis recipe works best with commercial chocolate chips, as the increased surface area of chopped chocolate can disrupt the structure of the dough. For the best flavor, try blending several supermarket brands with different cocoa percentages. For more information, see our\nguide to buying chocolate chips\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe portioned cookie dough can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 1 week. Alternatively, the portions can be individually wrapped, then placed in a freezer-safe zip-top bag and frozen for up to 6 months. Thaw frozen dough to 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), unwrap, and bake as directed.\nThese cookies taste best when freshly baked, but leftovers may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 days; rewarm briefly in a 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) oven before serving.\nRead More\nThe Food Lab's Chocolate Chip Cookies\nVegan Chocolate Chip Cookies\nQuick and Easy Chocolate Chip Cookies\nMalted Chocolate Chip-Pecan Cookies\nCookies\nBaking\nChocolate"
