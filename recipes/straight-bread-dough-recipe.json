  "full_text": "Straight Bread Dough Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n0 mins\nProofing Time\n3 hrs 20 mins\nTotal\n3 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor White Dough:\n567\ng\nbread flour\n5\ng\nyeast\n385\ng\nwater\n14\ng\nsalt\nFor Whole Wheat Dough:\n340\ng\nbread flour\n227\ng\nwhole wheat flour\n5\ng\nyeast\n397\ng\nwater\n14\ng\nsalt\nDirections\nSelect which recipe from above that you are going to use.\nMix the ingredients according to basic bread making (\nreference here as needed\n).\nKnead according to the instruction contained in the \u201c\nKneading\n\u201d. Because this dough has a relatively low hydration, I recommend using the convention kneading technique, although you may need to use the French method a few times just to get the dough into a more workable consistency. Knead until the gluten has fully developed and the dough can pass the window test. Note: The whole wheat dough recipe will never pass the window test because the hulls in the flour cut the gluten strands, just make sure that the dough is nice and elastic before moving on to the next step. This may take from 10 to 15 minutes of kneading depending on how fast and deliberate you are. (One side effect of kneading is that you get a workout in, too!)\nBulk ferment the dough according to the instructions (refer to\nProofing: the Basics\n). Bulk ferment for 30-45 minutes, or until the dough has just about doubled; fold the dough using one of the two techniques described in the \u201cBulk Fermentation\u201d section , then ferment for an additional 30 minutes. Fold again and ferment for another 15 minutes. Note: For the whole wheat dough, use the second folding technique. It will work much better due to the stiffer nature of the dough.\nFollowing the instruction set forth in the \u201c\nPreshaping Your Dough\n\u201d portion of Breadmaking 101, shape the dough into an oblong (if you\u2019d like the final shape to be a batard) or a round (if you\u2019d like the final shape to be a boule). Remember, you can always make smaller loaves or rolls as well. Just divide the dough accordingly (i.e. in half for one-pound loaves and into 60 gram pieces for rolls).\nAfter preshaping, let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes.\nUsing the instructions outlined in the \u201c\nStep 4: Final Shape\n,\" form your dough into its final shape.\nProof the dough according to the instructions set forth in the \u201c\nThe Final Proof\n.\" The dough should be covered, and proofing should take approximately 45-60 minutes, or until the dough springs back to the touch. If the dough remains dented after touching, continue proofing the dough until it springs back. (A perfect example where patience pays off!)\nScore the dough according to the instructions set forth in the \u201cScoring\u201d portion of\nBreadmaking 101\n.\nYeast Breads"
