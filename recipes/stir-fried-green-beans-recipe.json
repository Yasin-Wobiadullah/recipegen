Smash the garlic cloves with the blunt side of the cleaver until the cloves are flattened.\nIn the meantime, place your wok over the highest flame and let heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until the wok is smoking.\nQuickly swirl in the oil or cooking fat, and toss in the smashed garlic. Move the garlic around in the oil for about 5 seconds.\nToss all the green beans into the wok and rapidly stir the vegetables with a spatula or wooden spoon. Stir-fry for 2 to 4 minutes, until the green beans are still crisp and barely raw in the center. To check the doneness, taste a green bean after 2 minutes into the cooking.\nToss in the salt and the stock, and stir to coat the green beans with the liquid. Place a lid on the wok and turn off the heat. Let the stock gently finish cooking the green beans.\nThe green beans will be done when they are still crisp and just cooked through in the center. Serve piping hot. This stir-frying method of high heat with a gentle finish may be employed with other vegetables, such as zucchini, squash, broccoli, and cauliflower.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nThis Recipe Appears In\nIn Season: Green Beans\nVegetable Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nVegetable Stir-Fry\nGreen Beans"
