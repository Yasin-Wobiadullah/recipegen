Drain onion well, then add to bowl. Mix gently until thoroughly combined; season with salt and pepper. Dress with more olive oil if desired.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpoon tuna salad onto 4 slices of toast, top with arugula, then close sandwiches and serve.\nNotes\nThe quality of the tuna you use will make a difference here. I recommend oil-packed ventresca tuna, which comes from the richer, fatty belly; it's moister and more flavorful than other canned or jarred tuna. I like the ventresca from both Ortiz and Tonnino.\nRead More\nClassic Mayo-Dressed Tuna Salad Sandwiches\nWhite Bean and Tuna Salad\nOur Favorite Recipes That Use Canned Tuna\nJewish Deli-Style Tuna Melt With Relish, Dill, Celery, and Swiss\nFully Loaded Tuna Melt With Bacon, Pickled Peppers, and Tomato\nSandwiches\nNo-Cook Seafood\nTuna\nQuick Dinners",
