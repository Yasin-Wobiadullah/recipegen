  "full_text": "The Best Homemade Chocolate Dip (a.k.a. Magic Shell) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n5 mins\nActive\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nServes\n16 servings\nMakes\n2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n250\ng\n(\n1/2\npound\n)\ndark chocolate\n, 66% to 72%, finely chopped\n200\ng\n(about\n1\ncup\n)\nrefined\n(not unrefined or virgin)\ncoconut oil\n(see notes)\n125\ng\n(about\n6\ntablespoons\n)\nlight (clear) corn syrup\nDirections\nCombine chocolate, oil, and corn syrup in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on half power in 15-second bursts, stirring with a spoon in between, 3 to 4 times, until chocolate is completely melted. If heated too much, the chocolate may break, forming harmless brown speckles in the sauce; blend in a blender on high speed for 30 seconds to re-emulsify the sauce.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer chocolate dip to a squeeze bottle or container and store at room temperature, stirring with a spoon if it separates. For best results, let dip harden on ice cream for 30 seconds before eating.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nFor best results, use refined coconut oil, not unrefined or virgin. Refined coconut oils have a more neutral flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStore your chocolate dip at room temperature. It keeps for several months but will separate over time, so stir or shake before each use, or briefly warm up in a hot water bath or microwave until all ingredients re-combine.\nDessert Sauces\nChocolate\nCoconut Oil",
