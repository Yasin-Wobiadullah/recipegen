Simply place the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, and use a hand mixer on a medium to high speed to beat the yolks together for a couple of minutes, until the sugar is incorporated, and the yolks begin to turn pale.\nSet the bowl over the simmering water. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water; the steam will provide the heat. Add the rosewater and salt to the yolk and sugar mixture.\nUsing the electric mixer, continue to beat the egg-sugar-rosewater combination until it becomes frothy and has doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Take off the heat, and set aside.\nMeanwhile, divide the berries into glasses or bowls. Pour the rose sabayon on top and enjoy.\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nBlackberry\nRaspberry\nSummer"
