Set bowl and paddle of a stand mixer in freezer.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nMeanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and reduced in volume, 10-15 minutes. Let cool completely, then add leeks to bowl with meat and toss to distribute evenly.

Using chilled paddle attachment and chilled bowl of a standing mixer, mix at low speed for 1 minute.

Cook patty in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until cooked through. Taste and adjust seasoning of sausage if necessary.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nStuff sausage into hog casings and twist into 6-inch links. Place sausages on a large wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for 2 to 3 days; rotate sausages daily to allow air to circulate around all of them.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nIf smoking:\nIn a grill, light 10-15 charcoal briquettes, or small amount of lump charcoal. When charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pile coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Place wood chunk on top of charcoal. Set cooking grate in place, place sausages away from fire, and cover, positioning air vent over sausages. Smoke until wood and charcoal are burnt out, 1-2 hours. Remove sausages from grill.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over entire surface of charcoal grate. Alternatively, set all the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil\nthe grilling grate. Grill over medium-high direct heat until sausage registers 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) when an instant-read thermometer is inserted in middle of link. Remove from grill, let rest for 5 minutes. Serve immediately or for extra crispy sausages, split links down middle and place back on the grill, cut side down, and cook until well browned, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nSpecial Equipment\nMeat ginder\n, sausage stuffer,\ncharcoal grill\n,\nchimney starter\nNotes\nPink curing salt prevents bacterial growth and is available online.\nRead More\nHow to Get Started Grilling\nThe Best Way to Grill Sausages\nPork Mains\nGreek\nGrilled Sausages\nLeg of Lamb\nPork Shoulder",
