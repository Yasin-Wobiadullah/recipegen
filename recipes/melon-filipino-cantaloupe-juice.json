Starting at the top, insert fork tines 1/4 inch deep into cantaloupe flesh and drag vertically to the bottom. Using a spoon, scoop out scored flesh and transfer to a 2-quart pitcher. Repeat until all of the orange flesh has been shredded (do not shred the green flesh; it is bitter), then repeat with remaining half. You should have 2 cups of shredded flesh and juice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Shred Flesh Using Coconut Grater:\nHold one half of the cantaloupe in one hand with the stem end on top; grasp coconut grater with your other hand. Starting at the top, scrape grater vertically across cantaloupe flesh to the bottom. Transfer shredded flesh to a 2-quart pitcher.

You should have 2 cups of shredded flesh and juice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStir sugar and water into shredded cantaloupe until sugar is dissolved. Cover and chill in refrigerator for at least 8 hours.\nTo serve, pour the chilled cantaloupe juice over ice (making sure that some shredded cantaloupe ends up in the glass). If desired, add a spoon and straw and/or top with a splash of milk or milk substitute.\nSpecial Equipment\nCoconut grater (optional)\nNotes\nThis recipe calls for a small cantaloupe, but if you have a large cantaloupe more than 3 pounds in weight, you can either use just a portion of the cantaloupe, or scale the recipe up to match the larger quantity.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe juice can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nRead More\nFilipino Food 101: Recipes to Get You Started\nHow to Make Cucumber Water and Other Flavored Waters\n10 Melon Recipes to Cool Off Your Summer\nMelon-Mint Smoothie Recipe\nHalo-Halo (Filipino Shaved Ice Dessert) Recipe\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nFilipino\nMelon",
