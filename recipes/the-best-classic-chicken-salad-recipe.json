Slice 1 lemon into 1/8- to 1/4-inch slices. Place chicken in zipper-lock bags or vacuum bags and add whole tarragon sprigs and lemon slices. Remove air from zipper-lock bags by closing the bags, leaving the last inch of the top un-sealed. Slowly lower into a pot of water, sealing the bag completely just before it fully submerges. If using a vacuum bag, seal according to manufacturer instructions.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nPreheat a sous-vide cooker to 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C). Add chicken and cook for at least 1 hour and up to 4. Transfer to an ice bath and let chill for 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nWhile chicken is cooling, add 1 tablespoon juice and 1 teaspoon zest from remaining lemon to a large bowl. Add mayonnaise, mustard, minced tarragon leaves, parsley, chives, red onion, celery, and garlic and mix with a rubber spatula. Stir in additional lemon juice to taste, if desired. Keep refrigerated until chicken is ready.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nRemove chicken from bags and discard tarragon stems and lemon slices. Remove skin and bones from chicken and discard. Cut meat into 1/2-inch cubes and add to bowl with mayonnaise. Fold gently to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add more mayonnaise, mustard, or lemon juice to taste if desired. Serve with lettuce or in sandwiches.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nSous vide immersion circulator\n(if cooking sous-vide)\nNotes\nWhile sous vide produces perfectly tender and juicy chicken for this salad, there are plenty of other good options to use instead. We recommend our\ncold-start, low-and-slow poaching method\nfor supremely juicy results, or you can\nroast\nor\ngrill\nthe breasts until they register 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part. And, of course, leftover roast chicken works too (you'll want about 2 1/2 to 3 cups of cooked and diced chicken meat for this recipe).\nRead More\nCurry Chicken Salad\nBuffalo Chicken Salad\nMayo-Free Chicken Salad With Kimchi, Ginger, and Scallions\nDairy-free Salads\nGluten-free Salads\nSous Vide Chicken\nChicken Breast\nChicken Mains",
