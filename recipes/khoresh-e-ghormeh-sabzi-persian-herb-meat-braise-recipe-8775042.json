In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil or ghee over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add seasoned meat to the saucepan in a single layer. Cook, turning occasionally until meat is well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer meat to a plate and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nLower heat to medium, and once rendered fat in pan is shimmering, add onions and cook until translucent and edges have turned golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nSprinkle 1 teaspoon turmeric over the saut\u00e9ed onions, stir thoroughly and cook until fragrant,\u00a0about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nAdd 2 1/2 cups of water to the saucepan, bring to boil, while scraping the bottom of the saucepan to free up all brown bits left.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nAdd\u00a0seared meat. Stir to mix, return to boil, then reduce heat to medium low to maintain a simmer; cover and cook for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nMeanwhile, prepare the herbs. Wash all fresh herbs and leeks or chives well. Spread over a clean kitchen towel and gently roll to remove excess water. Alternatively, use a salad spinner to achieve the same results.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nHarvest the leaves and most tender stems from the bundles of parsley and cilantro (If you wish, save the scraps and longer tough stems for other purposes such as making broth.) Chop all fresh herbs (including chives or leeks) as finely as you can. The finer you chop them the more luscious the ghormeh-sabzi will be. Feel free to use a food processor to chop the herbs. However never chop the chives or leeks in the food processor by themselves\u2014if you do, they will turn into an unpleasant mushy mess. Either mix them with the parsley and cilantro to be chopped in the food processor or simply chop them separately the good old fashioned way with a sharp knife on a cutting board.\nAfter the meat has cooked for 30 minutes, drain the kidney beans and add to the pot, stir to combine and cover. Adjust the heat so the content of the pot is simmering gently. Cook for another 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nMeanwhile, in a large frying pan, heat 1/4 cup ghee or oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium. Add half of the chopped herb mixture. Carefully stir to mix well with oil. Cook until well coated and beginning to cook down, about a minute. Add the rest of the chopped parsley-cilantro-leek mixture. Cook, stirring often until cooked down for 10 minutes, then sprinkle with crushed dried fenugreek leaves. Continue cooking, stirring often, until the herbs are very wilted and are a dark green color but not burned, about 10 more minutes. The herbs are ready when they feel a bit dry but when pressed with the back of a spoon\u00a0exude shiny bright green oil, and you can smell a strong savory aroma. This is a crucial step that could take 20 to 25 minutes total. Be patient.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nDrain\u00a0whole Persian dried limes with a sharp instrument, such as a tine of a fork or tip of a sharp knife) make 6 or 7 small holes in the outer skin of each lime.\nAfter the meat has cooked for 1 hour, add the fried herbs and the pierced dried limes to the meat and gently stir. Cover and adjust heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, gently stirring every 20 minutes until the meat and beans are tender and the stew is thickened, 60 to 80 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nBy this time, the whole Persian dry limes should be quite soft, plump, and juicy\u2013full of tangy, sourish, earthy liquid. With a slotted spoon or small strainer, lift one of the whole Persian dry limes and very gently press down on it with the back of a fork without breaking the exterior skin, letting some of the interior liquid drip into the stew. Repeat with another 3 or 4 of the limes. Gently swirl the pot. Taste. If you can\u2019t sense enough of the tangy, sourish, earthy flavor of the limes, repeat with the rest of the limes. It is OK if the exterior skin of the limes breaks in this process\u2014just don\u2019t let the seeds get into the stew as they are a bit bitter if chewed.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nWhen ready, ghormeh-sabzi should be quite thick, be a very dark green color with red kidney beans, chunks of tender meat, and the limes poking out of the sea of the green herbs, tasting noticeably tangy, with the unique aroma of cooked fenugreek having filled the kitchen. Season to taste with salt as needed and serve.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven or pot, large saut\u00e9e pan\nNotes\nYou may substitute canned beans for the dried beans. Since they are precooked, they do not need as much cooking time in the braise liquid. Simply add the cup of canned beans during the last 30 minutes of cooking.\nSome Persian, Afghani, and Middle Eastern specialty markets also carry both frozen and dry pre-mixed Ghormeh-Sabzi herb mixtures.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThere are two aspects of ghormeh-sabzi that contribute to its slightly lengthy preparation time: the cooking of the meat and the preparation of the herbs. Steps 3-7 of the recipe can easily be done a day or two ahead of time. Store the resulting partially cooked meat in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Steps 8 and 10 can also be done a day or two ahead of time. Store the fully fried herb mixture in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nLike many other Persian khoreshes, ghormeh-sabzi can be made a day or two ahead of time as long as it is reheated gently. In fact, many Persian home cooks (including myself) believe that it tastes better on the second day.\nRefrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to a week. Reheat gently on the stovetop.\nFor longer storage, freeze the ghormeh-sabzi in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before reheating gently on the stovetop.\nMains\nThe Latest\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nBraised & Stewed Lamb\nMiddle Eastern",
