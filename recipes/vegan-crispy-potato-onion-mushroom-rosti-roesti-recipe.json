Add onion and mushrooms and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until softened and starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl and wipe out skillet.\nHeat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil in skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add half of potatoes and press into bottom of pan with a rubber spatula. Season with salt and pepper. Spread onion/mushroom mixture evenly over potatoes and top with remaining potatoes. Press down into an even disk shape using a rubber spatula. Season top with salt and pepper.\nCook, swirling and shaking pan occasionally, until deep golden brown and crisp on the first side, about 7 minutes. Carefully slide r\u00f6sti onto a large plate. Set another plate on top of it upside down, grip the edges, and invert the whole thing so the r\u00f6sti is now cooked side up. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil in skillet and slide r\u00f6sti back in. Continue cooking, swirling and shaking pan occasionally, until deep golden brown and crisp on the second side, about 7 minutes longer. Slide r\u00f6sti onto a cutting board. Serve immediately with a side of\nvegan aioli\n.\nSpecial equipment\nMandoline with a 1/16-inch matchstick plate,\nfood processor\n, or box grater (see note); Microplane grater; 10-inch\ncast iron\nor nonstick skillet\nNotes\nFor best results, cut potatoes into 1/16-inch matchsticks by hand or on a mandoline. If you don't have one, the large shredding disk of a\nfood processor\nor large holes of a box grater will do fine.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nVegan Brunch: Crispy Potato, Onion, and Mushroom R\u00f6sti\nDairy-free Breakfast & Brunch\nGluten-free Breakfast & Brunch\nVegan Breakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nStovetop Vegetables"
