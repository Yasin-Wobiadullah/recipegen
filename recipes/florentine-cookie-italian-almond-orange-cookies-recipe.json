Line two baking sheets with silipat liners (see note). In a medium bowl, combine almonds, flour, zest, and salt; set aside.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine butter, corn syrup, heavy cream, and sugar over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once boiling, let boil hard for 1 minute, then take off heat, stir in vanilla, and pour over nut mixture. Stir to combine.\nWhen dough is cool enough to handle, scoop into rounded tablespoons and drop on prepared baking sheets at least 2 1/2-inches apart. Bake until golden and flat, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool completely then gently remove from baking sheet.\nNotes\nIf you have silpat sheets, this is the time to use them. These cookies are incredibly thin and crunchy. It's much easier to peel them off the silicone liners than off greased parchment. Also, don't store these cookies with others as the moisture from the other cookies will cause these to soften.\nSpecial Equipment\nSilpat liners or parchment (see note)\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCookie Monster: Florentines\nCookies\nBaking\nAlmonds"
