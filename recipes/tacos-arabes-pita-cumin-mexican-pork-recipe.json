If necessary, place meat in the freezer for 15 minutes to firm it up. Split the sides of a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag. Place one slice of meat inside bag and pound with the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet or a meat pounder until less than 1/4 inch thick. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining meat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd onion, lime juice, cumin, oregano, and salt to pork and toss with hands until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLine the bottom of a disposable aluminum loaf pan with bacon. Add a layer of thin-sliced marinated pork. Continue with alternating layers of marinated pork and bacon until all the meat is used up. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 36.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Cook Indoors:\nPreheat oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Uncover aluminum loaf pan and place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to oven and cook until meat is completely tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C), 2 to 3 hours (it will render lots of fat). Remove from oven, allow to cool slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\nTo Cook Outdoors:\nLight half a chimney of charcoal and allow to preheat until coals are mostly covered in gray ash. Spread out under one half of coal grate and place cooking grate on top. Alternatively, set one set of burners on a gas grill to low and leave the remaining burners off. Unwrap aluminum loaf pan and place directly over cooler side of grill, placing a drip pan underneath if desired. Cover grill and cook until loaf registers 180\u00b0F in the center, about 3 hours, adding more coals to grill or adjusting burners as necessary to maintain an air temperature of around 275\u00b0F for the duration of cooking. Remove from grill, allow to cool slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\nFor the Chipotle Salsa:\nIn a blender, combine chipotles and their sauce, garlic, vinegar, oregano, and cumin. Add 1 cup water and blend at high speed until a smooth pur\u00e9e forms; add more water as necessary, 1 tablespoon at a time, to reach a thick yet pourable consistency. Season with salt. Chipotle salsa can be refrigerated for up to 5 days.\nFor the Yogurt Sauce:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together yogurt, lemon or lime juice, olive oil, parsley, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Yogurt sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.\nTo Serve:\nRemove cooked meat from aluminum loaf pan, scraping off any fat or jellied juices from its sides; reserve rendered fat and juices. Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice meat as thinly as possible to create fine shavings of meat and fat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer meat and 1 tablespoon of fat to a large cast iron or nonstick skillet. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until meat crisps and browns in spots. Add any reserved juices and toss to combine, allowing juices to cook until reduced to a moist glaze. Transfer meat to a warmed serving bowl.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe warmed meat right away with warmed pita bread, lime wedges, chipotle salsa, and yogurt sauce.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nDisposable aluminum loaf pan;\nrimmed baking sheet\nor\ngrill\nand\nchimney starter\n,\nnonstick\nor\ncast iron skillet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nblender\nNotes\nThe exact number of pita rounds you'll need will depend on the size of the pita bread itself. This recipe is scaled for smaller (approximately 6-inch) rounds. If your pita is thick and puffy, you may want to split each pita through the middle to create two thinner rounds for easier rolling around the filling.\nRead More\nHomemade Tacos Al Pastor\nTacos\nMexican\nGrilled Pork\nPork\nCinco de Mayo"
