Transfer to a large sealable container and add pork tenderloin. Toss to coat, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 and up to 8 hours.\nAfter pork has marinated, preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of heavy-duty foil. Top with pork and pour marinade over. Roast until the center of the thickest section of the pork reads 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\nWhile pork rests, pour any excess juices into a small bowl and discard foil. Clean and dry the baking sheet, if necessary. Spread butter all over the exterior of the bread. Set bottom bread halves on baking sheet. Spread mustard thinly on bottom halves, then top with sliced ham.\nSlice pork tenderloin into thin, 1/4-inch-thick slices. Layer pork tenderloin over ham and drizzle with reserved cooking juices. Top with pickles and Swiss cheese, then close sandwiches.\nPlace a second sheet pan over sandwiches and press down firmly. Place heavy, oven-safe objects, such as cast iron pots or pans, on top of the sheet pan to compress the sandwiches, then carefully transfer to the oven.\nBake until cheese has melted and ingredients have warmed through, about 20 minutes. Cut sandwiches crosswise into individual portions and serve with additional mustard, if desired.\nSpecial equipment\nFood processor\n,\n2 rimmed baking sheets\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nSandwiches\nCaribbean\nRoasted Pork\nPork\nHam"
