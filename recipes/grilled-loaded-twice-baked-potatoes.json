Poke each potato several times with a fork and place directly on the rack. Bake until skin just starts to crisp and flesh is soft, about 1 hour. Remove from oven.\nMeanwhile, preheat a gas grill to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\nWhen cool enough to handle, slice off upper-third of potatoes. Scoop out interior into a medium bowl, leaving a 1/4-inch layer of flesh. Add cream cheese and sour cream and beat with a hand-held mixer until thoroughly combined and fluffy, about 30 seconds. Fold in all but 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese, bacon, and chives with a wooden spoon. Season with salt, to taste.\nBrush outer skins with melted butter (see note). Fill hollowed skins generously with potato mixture and sprinkle tops with reserved cheese. Place in the center of grill over direct heat and cook until skins are crackly, the interiors are warmed through and the cheese on top is bubbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from grill and let cool for 3 minutes before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nGas grill\n,\nhand mixer\nNotes\nInstead of brushing skins with butter before they're grilled, try using some reserved bacon fat. It'll up the smoke factor and make the skins even cracklier.\nRead More\nPimento Cheese Twice Baked Potatoes Recipe\nThe Ultimate Baked Potato Recipe\nAir-Fryer Baked Potato Recipe\nPotato Skins Recipe\nNacho-Style Baked Potatoes Recipe\nSpinach and Artichoke Dip Baked Potatoes Recipe\nVegetable Sides\nGrilled Potatoes\nGrilled Vegetables\nCheese\nRusset Potatoes",
