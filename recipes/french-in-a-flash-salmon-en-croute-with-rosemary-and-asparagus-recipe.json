Bring a pot of water to boil, and salt the water. Drop the asparagus in the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer the asparagus to an ice bath, and cool completely. Dry on a paper towel, then slice into thin coins on a bias. Mix the asparagus pieces with rosemary, garlic, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and lemon zest in a small bowl.\nUnfold both sheets of puff pastry, and lay them separately on a counter or cutting board. Place one piece of salmon on one side of each sheet of puff pastry. Top each salmon fillet with half the asparagus mixture. Then, fold the pastry over the salmon, and press the pastry together to form a seal. Trim any pastry border in excess of 1 inch, and then crimp the edge of the pastry. Cut 2 or 3 steam vents in the top of the pastry, and place the two parcels on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake until puffed and golden, about 35 minutes. Slice each parcel in half, and serve immediately.\nSalmon\nFrench\nSavory\nAsparagus\nRosemary"
