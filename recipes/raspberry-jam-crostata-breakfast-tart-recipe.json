Pulse to combine, about 5 short pulses. Add butter and pulse until it is the size of peas, about 5 pulses more. Add egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract, and milk and pulse until dough forms, adding the ice water (and more if needed) to help it come together. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for 2 hours.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Butter tart pan.\nDivide dough into roughly 2/3 and 1/3 pieces. Press the larger piece evenly into the bottom of the tart pan, also covering the sides of the pan. Place jam in a bowl and whisk to make it easier to spread. Spread jam evenly over the crust to coat.\nRoll out remaining dough onto a clean, lightly floured surface until it is 1/4-inch thick. Cut dough into 1-inch wide strips. Lay them parallel to each other, about 1-inch apart, across top of tart. Re-roll dough if needed and cut out more strips. Place the newly cut strips across the existing ones so that they are perpendicular to them and create a lattice pattern. For more help with creating a lattice crust, see directions\nhere\n.\nBrush lattice crust with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Place tart in the oven and bake until crust is golden and jam is set, about 50 minutes. Let cool completely before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nfood processor, 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom, rolling pin, pastry brush\nThis Recipe Appears In\nWake and Bake: Raspberry Jam Crostata\nDesserts\nBaking\nRaspberry\nPies",
