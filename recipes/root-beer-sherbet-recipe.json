  "full_text": "Root Beer Sherbet Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nActive\n45 mins\nChurning/Freezing Time\n5 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n5 hrs 35 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nMakes\n1 quart\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\nroot beer\n(see note), chilled\n1\ncup\nheavy cream\n, chilled\n1\ncup\n\"light\" (clear)\ncorn syrup\n1/2\ncup\nsugar\n1/4\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\n3/4 to\u00a01\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\nDirections\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk together root beer, cream, corn syrup, sugar, and vanilla until very well combined. Whisk in salt to taste. The root beer bubbles may form a fizzy raft in the bowl when combined with the cream; this is fine, and churning will fully incorporate it into the base.\nIf root beer and cream were not chilled, refrigerate mixture for 2 to 3 hours until very cold. Churn mixture according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer sherbet to container and chill in freezer for at least 3 to 4 hours before serving.\nNotes\nKeep your root beer chilled in the refrigerator and you'll be able to enjoy this in under an hour.\nThe bolder your root beer for this sherbet, the better. We're big fans of Barq's; see our\nroot beer taste test\nfor details.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nThis Recipe Appears In\nWhy It's Time to Start Making Your Own Sherbet\nIce Cream\nNorth American\nSummer Desserts",
