Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are very sweet and a rich golden-brown color, 1 to 2 hours. If browned onion juices on bottom of pot threaten to burn, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) water, scrape up browned bits, and continue cooking; add water whenever needed to prevent burning. Season with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nstainless steel saut\u00e9 pan\nor 2\nstainless steel\nor\ncast iron skillets\nNotes\nYellow onions are your best all-purpose bet, but a mix of yellow, sweet (e.g., Vidalia), and red onions, as well as shallots, produces an even more complex flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe onions can be refrigerated in a sealed container for up to one week. Rewarm before serving.\nRead More\nA Beginner's Guide to Onions\nFrench Onion Soup Tarte Tatin\nCaramelized Onion and Goat Cheese Tartlets\nFrench Onion Strata (Savory Bread Pudding)\nOnions\nCondiments & Sauces\nVegetable Sides",
