Pulse until smooth paste is formed, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Run processor continuously until mixture becomes smooth and sticky, about 15 seconds. Transfer shrimp mixture to a large bowl and refrigerate it for at least 10 minutes.\nPlace bread crumbs in a shallow pie plate. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or wok to 325\u00b0F as registered on an instant read or deep-frying thermometer.\nRoughly divide the shrimp mixture in the bowl into four equal portions. Divide each portion again into four portions to form 16 equal piles.\nForm each portion of shrimp mixture into a patty about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Roll each patty in the bread crumbs and gently lower it into the hot oil. The shrimp cakes puff up quite considerably in the oil, so make sure you don't overcrowd your frying vessel.\nFlip the shrimp cakes over a few times while they're frying. Once they're golden brown, fish them out onto a paper towel-lined plate.\nServe the shrimp cakes immediately with Thai sweet chili sauce.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMy Thai: Thai Shrimp Cakes with Sweet Chili Sauce\nHors D'Oeuvres\nThai\nFried Seafood\nShrimp"
