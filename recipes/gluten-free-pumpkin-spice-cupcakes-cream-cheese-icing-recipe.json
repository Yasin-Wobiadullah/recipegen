Add pumpkin mixture to the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth.\nFill prepared muffin cups about 2/3 full. Bake until cupcakes are golden brown and spring back to the touch, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. Repeat with any remaining batter.\nFor the Cream Cheese Icing:\nUsing a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or handheld electric beaters, beat together cream cheese and butter until softened and creamy. Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Whip until light and smooth. Spread on cooled cupcakes (if you ice warm cupcakes, the icing will melt.) Store cupcakes, covered, on the counter for up to 3 days.\nSpecial Equipment\nTwo (12-cup) muffin tins; cupcake liners; stand mixer or handheld electric beaters\nNotes\nThis cupcake recipe is dairy-free but the icing isn't. If you follow a dairy-free diet, replace the butter and cream cheese in the icing with dairy-free alternatives. Daiya's dairy-free cream cheese works especially well.\nCupcakes\nGluten-free Desserts\nPumpkin",
