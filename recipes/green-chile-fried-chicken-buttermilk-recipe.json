Rub salt and nutmeg into chicken well, then pour over with buttermilk. Seal and let brine overnight.\nThe next day, drain chicken of excess brine. Reserve the buttermilk and do not pat the chicken dry. Rub green chile into chicken well. Fill a pie plate with some flour and a couple heavy pinches of salt, and lightly dip chicken into flour. Shake off all excess. If dredging once, let chicken sit on a cooling rack. If dredging twice, dip chicken in reserved buttermilk, shaking off excess, and dredge again in flour.\nWhile chicken rests, heat a large skillet (preferably 12-inch cast iron) with enough oil to come halfway up chicken on medium high heat. Oil is hot when a pinch of flour mixed with buttermilk sizzles readily. Add chicken pieces, skin side down, making sure they do not touch. Fry for about 10 minutes or until a dark golden crust forms on first side, then flip over and fry for about another 10 minutes, or until dark crust forms. Depending on thickness of chicken, some pieces may need to fry on a third side.\nRemove chicken to a cooling rack to drain off excess oil. Internal temperature of chicken should read between 165 and 170\u00b0F (74 and 77\u00b0C; if lower, finish cooking chicken in a 400\u00b0F or 205\u00b0C oven). Allow chicken to rest 10 minutes, then serve warm or room temperature.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Drying Chiles at Home\nChicken Mains\nFried Chicken\nGreen Chiles",
