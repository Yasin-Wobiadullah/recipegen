Combine butter, coconut oil, sugar, salt, baking powder, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape bowl with a flexible spatula halfway through. With mixer running, add egg and continue beating until smooth.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReduce speed to low, add flour, and mix to form a stiff dough, then add frozen cookie pieces and continue mixing until well combined.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPortion the Dough:\nWith a scoop, divide dough into 2-tablespoon portions. With your hands, roll each piece smooth and round. (If you like, portioned dough can be refrigerated in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70\u00b0F/21\u00b0C, and proceed as directed.)\nBake the Dough:\nArrange portions on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving 2 inches between cookies to account for spread. With the palm of your hand, flatten each into a 1/2-inch disk; if you like, garnish with extra Oreo crumbs.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake until puffed and firm around the edges, and pale overall but with a hint of browning around the very edges, about 12 minutes. Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes. Enjoy warm or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer, flexible spatula, 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, half-sheet pans\nNotes\nSurprisingly, virgin coconut oil works well in this recipe, giving the cookies a wonderful aroma that's not overtly coconutty at all, but refined coconut oil is clearly the most neutral option. Feel free to use whichever you have on hand.\nCookies\nBaking\nChocolate\nChristmas Cookies",
