Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nAdjust oven rack to middle position. Set a 12-inch cast-iron skillet on the rack, and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Remove batter from refrigerator while oven preheats.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nWhen oven has preheated, remove skillet from oven, and add butter; using gloved hands or oven mitts, carefully swirl skillet to coat bottom and edges of pan with butter until completely melted, about 20 seconds. Pour batter into pan and bake for 10 minutes. With skillet still in oven, reduce oven temperature to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C) and bake until golden brown and significantly puffed around edges, 8 to 10 minutes more.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nMeanwhile, for the Whipped Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, sugar, vanilla paste, and salt until medium-stiff peaks form, about 1 minute. Cover with a plate or plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use. If mixture has loosened, briefly whisk again to medium-stiff peaks before serving.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nTo Serve:\nRemove Dutch baby from oven. Using a small fine-mesh sieve, dust pancake with confectioners' sugar, and serve with whipped cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, lemon wedges, and fresh berries, if desired. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats/ Morgan Hunt Glaze\nEquipment\nBlender, 12-inch cast iron skillet, small fine-mesh sieve\nNotes\nVanilla extract can be substituted for the paste in equal amounts, but its flavor won\u2019t be quite as robust.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe Dutch baby is best eaten immediately after it's baked.\nQuick Breakfast\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nBreakfast & Brunch\nPancakes"
