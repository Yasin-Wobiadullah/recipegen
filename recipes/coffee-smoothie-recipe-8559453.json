  "full_text": "Creamy, Nutty Coffee Smoothie\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nFreezing Time\n4 hrs\nTotal\n4 hrs 5 mins\nServes\n2\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2\ncups\n(\n354\nml\n) strong cold coffee, such as unsweetened\ncold brew\nor iced coffee (see notes)\n1\n(5.3 ounce; 150 g) container\ncoffee yogurt\n(see notes)\n1/4\ncup\n(\n60\nml\n)\nsweetened condensed milk\n1\ntablespoon\n(\n15\ng\n) unsweetened creamy\nalmond butter\n1/8\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use a pinch\n2\nteaspoons\n(\n8\ng\n)\nchocolate-covered espresso beans\n, chopped, for garnish (optional)\nDirections\nPlace 1 ice cube tray (see special equipment section, below) on a small, rimmed baking sheet. Pour cold coffee evenly into ice cube tray and freeze until completely frozen, at least 4 hours.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nCombine yogurt, condensed milk, almond butter, and salt in a blender. Remove coffee ice cubes from freezer and place in blender. Blend until smooth, 45 to 60 seconds. Pour into 2 chilled glasses or mason jars and garnish with chopped espresso beans. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nSpecial Equipment\n1 ice cube tray with fifteen 1.25-inch compartments, blender\nNotes\nIf you make a larger quantity of coffee, you\u2019ll want to weigh out 12 1/2 (354g) of ice cubes for the smoothie.\nWe generally prefer full-fat yogurt, but low-fat will work well too: We found Dannon low-fat coffee yogurt worked particularly well in our tests comparing different coffee yogurt brands in this recipe.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nCoffee ice cubes can be prepared up to 2 weeks in advance. Once frozen, transfer to an airtight container or freezer bag.\nVariations\nFeel free to use this smoothie recipe as a template for coming up with your own perfect beverage. Swap out coffee yogurt for plain, vanilla, coconut or any other flavor you like with coffee, experiment with different kinds of frozen coffee, or substitute with your favorite nut butter. (Gianduja would be delicious, though you may have to reduce the sweetness elsewhere). Heck, even chuck in a banana.\nCoffee\nThe Latest\nBreakfast & Brunch\nDrinks\nSmoothies"
