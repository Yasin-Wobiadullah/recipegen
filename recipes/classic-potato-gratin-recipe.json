Bring to a boil, then remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 1 hour.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nReturn milk mixture to boil, then strain into a large heatproof bowl, pressing gently on the solids.\nUsing a mandoline, slice the peeled potatoes crosswise 1/16-inch (1.5mm) thick, directly into the hot milk mixture. Stir the potatoes to fully coat.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). In a small bowl, combine the Gruy\u00e8re and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.\nGrease a 2-quart baking dish with the butter. Lay the sliced potatoes in one even layer, then sprinkle with about 1/3 cup cheese mixture. Repeat layering potatoes and cheese until all the potatoes have been used and half the cheese mixture remains (you should have about 4 layers); leave the top layer without cheese. Pour any remaining milk mixture over the layered potatoes.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nCover with aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour. Remove baking dish from oven and remove foil. Evenly sprinkle remaining cheese on top and continue to bake, uncovered, until the potatoes have become tender, the sauce has thickened, and the surface is lightly golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow the gratin to rest 30 minutes before serving.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nMandoline slicer\n,\nmesh strainer\n,\n2-quart baking dish\nFrench\nAmerican\nRoasted Potatoes\nGruyere\nParmesan",
