Add brown sugar, water, rosemary, cayenne pepper (if using), and salt; stir until combined and melted, about 20 seconds. Cook until mixture reduces slightly and hazelnuts look sticky, about 2 minutes. Pour nuts onto a parchment-lined plate or baking sheet and spread into a single layer. Allow to cool completely, about 10 minutes. Store in a sealed container until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nFor the Dressing:\nIn a small bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, fig preserves, Dijon, salt, and pepper; slowly drizzle in oil, whisking constantly, until emulsified. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nFor the Salad:\nIn a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pears, cut side down, and cook until browned on all cut sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool slightly, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nWhile pears cool, in a large bowl, toss escarole and butter lettuce with the prepared dressing. Top with pomegranate seeds, shaved aged gouda, and the prepared candied hazelnuts. Slice pears thin and arrange attractively on top of the salad. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet\nNotes\nWhile we prefer the red pop of a d'Anjou pear, any of the listed pear varieties will work in this recipe.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe candied hazelnuts can be made and stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 1 week before serving.\nThe dressing can be made and refrigerated in an airtight container up to 3 days before serving.\nSalads\nThe Latest\nFall\nWinter\nThanksgiving",
