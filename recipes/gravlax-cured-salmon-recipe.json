Add salmon and let stand 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nIn a skillet, toast caraway and coriander seeds over high heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind finely.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nIn a small bowl, stir together salt, sugar, ground caraway and coriander seeds, and white or black pepper until thoroughly combined.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nRemove salmon from bath and pat dry with paper towels. On a work surface, turn salmon skin side up and sprinkle about half of salt mixture all over, rubbing in with fingers.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nArrange half of dill all over the bottom of a baking dish large enough to hold salmon. Set salmon skin side down on bed of dill. Rub remaining salt mixture all over top and sides of salmon, then top with remaining dill. Cover salmon with plastic, then top with a weight (such as a smaller baking dish or plate with cans of beans on top). Refrigerate for 1 day.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nAfter 1 day, unpack salmon and turn skin side up. Re-pack with dill, cover with plastic, and set weight back on top. Refrigerate until salmon is sufficiently cured, 1 day longer for a lighter cure or 2 days longer for slightly more cure (which will mean a slightly firmer texture and saltier flavor).\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nFor the Sauce:\nBefore serving, make the sauce. In a blender or mini food processor, or using an immersion blender, combine vinegar with chopped dill fronds, mustard, and sugar and blend until dill is very finely chopped. Add oil and blend until a smooth sauce has formed. Season with pepper.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nUnpack salmon, scraping off dill, and set on a work surface. Using a very sharp slicing knife, cut gravlax on a bias into thin slices. Arrange on slices of pumpernickel bread and drizzle sauce on top. Serve. Gravlax can be kept refrigerated, tightly wrapped in plastic, for approximately 5 days after curing.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nSpecial Equipment\nSpice grinder\nor\nmortar and pestle\n;\nbaking dish\n;\nblender\n, mini food processor, or\nimmersion blender\nSalmon\nScandinavian\nNo-Cook Seafood\nDill\nSnacks & Appetizers"
