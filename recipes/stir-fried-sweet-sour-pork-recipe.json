Add pork, stirring with chopsticks or a strainer to separate the pieces, and cook until pork is opaque and nearly cooked through, about 40 seconds. Drain work into a colander and shake well to remove excess water. Wipe wok clean and dry thoroughly.\nSerious Eats / Shao Z.\nFor the Stir-Fry:\nIn a small bowl, stir together pineapple juice, tomato paste, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and cornstarch.\nHeat vegetable oil in wok over high heat until smoking. Add bell peppers and onions and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add pork and continue to stir-fry until browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Using a spatula, push pork and vegetables up side of wok, then add sauce so that it pools in center. Bring sauce to a boil, stirring, then toss with pork and vegetables until sauce thickens and coats them well. Turn off heat and toss in pineapple chunks. Transfer to a platter immediately and serve with rice.\nSerious Eats / Shao Z.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nNotes\nTo make the egg white easier to measure, beat it with a fork until it has a thinner viscosity.\nThis recipe can also be made with an equal amount of chicken breast cut into strips. Just use the chicken in place of pork and proceed as directed.\nRead More\nWok Skills 101: Passing-Through\nWok Skills 101: Stir-Frying Basics\nSweet-and-Sour Grilled Chicken Skewers (Yakitori Nanbasu)\nSweet and Sour Sauce Recipe\nPork Mains\nChinese\nPork Stir-Fry\nPork Loin\nQuick Dinners",
