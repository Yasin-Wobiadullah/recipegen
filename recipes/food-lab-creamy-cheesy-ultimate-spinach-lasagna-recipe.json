Add shallots and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add a few large handfuls of spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted. Continue adding spinach a handful at a time until it is all in the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until spinach expels its moisture and most of that moisture evaporates, leaving a dry bottom as you stir. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nTransfer spinach to a fine mesh strainer set over the sink and press out excess moisture with a rubber spatula. Let spinach continue to drain as you prepare the ricotta mixture.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nFor the Ricotta:\nTransfer half of the ricotta, both eggs, the Parmesan, and the nutmeg to the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pepper. Process until completely smooth, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nTransfer mixture to a large bowl but do not wipe out food processor. Transfer spinach to food processor and pulse until finely chopped, 10 to 12 short pulses. Add spinach and remaining ricotta to the ricotta mixture and fold gently to combine.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nFor the White Sauce:\nHeat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until melted. Add flour and increase heat to medium high. Cook, stirring butter and flour with a whisk until paled golden blond, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in milk. Continue to cook, whisking frequently, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Remove from heat and add 3/4 of mozzarella and Comt\u00e9, Gruy\u00e8re, or Emmenthale cheese. Whisk until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nTo Assemble:\nAdjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta sheets a few at a time and cook until barely tender, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a fine mesh strainer and run under cool water until well chilled. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel in a single layer. Continue until all pasta is par-cooked and dried.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nDrizzle a small amount of white sauce over the bottom of a lasagna pan or large casserole. Add a layer of noodles. Top with 1/12th of spinach mixture and 1/12th of remaining white sauce. Continue layering pasta, spinach, and white sauce until you lay down the top sheet of pasta.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpread remaining spinach mixture evenly over the top. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Comt\u00e9 or Emmentaler cheese and drizzle with remaining white sauce. Spread into an even layer with a rubber spatula.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nCover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until bubble and lightly browned, about 20 minutes longer. Let rest at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, then slice and serve.\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge baking dish or lasagna pan\n,\nfood processor\nNotes\nMost store-bought ricotta is terrible. Look for a brand like Calabro, which contains nothing more than milk, salt, and either an acid or starter. If quality ricotta is unavailable, substitute cottage cheese instead.\nBaked Pasta\nVegetarian Mains\nSpinach\nPasta Mains"
