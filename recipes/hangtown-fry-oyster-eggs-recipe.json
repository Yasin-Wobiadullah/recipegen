Fry the bacon over medium heat in large skillet until bacon is fully cooked and brown. Remove and drain on paper towel and once cool enough to handle, coarsely chop. Add breaded oysters to remaining bacon fat in pan and cook until oysters are just firm and cornmeal begins to brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove oysters from pan and reserve. Add onions to what\u2019s left of the oil in the pan (adding additional vegetable oil if necessary) and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.\nRemove skillet from heat and carefully wipe with paper towel, or wash completely and place back on heat. Melt butter over medium heat and season the beaten egg with a pinch of salt and pepper. Once bubbles have subsided, add beaten egg, swirling pan so that egg coats the entire bottom. When egg has set, but is still a little wet on the top, gently slide onto a large dish or platter. Scatter bacon, onions and oysters on one side of omelet and gently fold the other half of the omelet across the filling. Scatter with scallions and serve with buttered toast and Bloody Marys.\nSpecial equipment\n12 inch skillet\nBreakfast & Brunch\nStovetop\nOmelettes\nOysters"
