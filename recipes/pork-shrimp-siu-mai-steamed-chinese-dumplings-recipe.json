Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Drain and rinse shrimp under cold running water, then pat dry with paper towels.\nPlace the shrimp in a food processor and pulse 10 times, until coarsely chopped. Transfer shrimp to a large mixing bowl. Add pork and pork fat to the food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer pork to bowl with shrimp.\nAdd white pepper, salt, cornstarch, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, olive oil, ginger, and sugar to the pork and shrimp, and, using a spatula or chopsticks, mix well until thoroughly combined. Set filling aside in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or overnight.\nTo wrap the siu mai, place 1 wonton wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper. Bring two opposite corners towards each other, and press gently to adhere them to filling. Repeat with remaining 2 corners to form a little cup around the filling, gently squeezing to hold wrapper in place. Place one carrot round (if using) on the bottom of each siu mai, add a little bit of the minced carrot on top, and transfer to a plate. Continue wrapping the remaining siu mai. The siu mai can be frozen now (see note) or cooked; note that frozen siu mai are best made without the carrot rounds on the bottom.\nTo steam, line your steamer basket or tray with parchment paper (Napa cabbage laves can also work). Pour enough water into your steaming pot or wok so that the water is about 1 inch below the bottom of the steamer basket or tray. Bring to a boil.\nArrange siu mai in the steamer tray, leaving room around each one and steaming in batches if necessary. Steam fresh siu mai until cooked through, about 7 minutes.\nTransfer to a plate. Serve. (Note that siu mai are traditionally served without a dipping sauce, though if you prefer one, mix soy sauce with a little sesame oil and fresh scallions and serve alongside.)\nSpecial equipment\nfood processor, steamer\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai, a Classic Chinese Dim Sum Dumpling\nSnacks & Appetizers\nPork\nShrimp"
