Set steak on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours before cooking.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo Grill the Steak:\nOpen bottom vent of a charcoal grill completely. Light chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). Once top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into a steeply banked pile against 1 side of the grill; set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, turn all burners of a gas grill to high, cover, and heat grill until hot (500\u00b0F; 260\u00b0C), about 15 minutes. Clean and oil grill grate.\nTransfer steaks to hot side of grill. Cover and cook for 1 minute. Flip steaks, cover, and cook for another minute. Continue cooking in this manner, flipping and covering, until steaks are well charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into their center registers 110 to 115\u00b0F for medium-rare or 115 to 120\u00b0F for medium, 6 to 8 minutes; brush steaks all over with a small amount of chichurri for the last minute of cooking. Transfer steaks to a large plate and allow to rest in a warm place for 10 minutes.\nTo Cook on a Plancha or in a Skillet:\nIn a large cast iron skillet or on a large plancha or cast iron griddle, heat 2 tablespoons oil (30ml) over high heat until lightly smoking. Add steaks in a single layer and cook, turning frequently, until well browned on both sides and center of steak registers 110 to 115\u00b0F for medium-rare or 115 to 120\u00b0F for medium, 6 to 8 minutes; brush steaks all over with a small amount of chichurri for the last minute of cooking. (If you own a cooking or grilling weight, you can use it to press down on the meat and improve the sear.) Transfer steaks to a large plate and allow to rest in a warm place for 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCut steaks crosswise into 5- or 6-inch sections, then slice thinly against the grain and serve with chimichurri sauce spoon on top.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nA cut like boneless beef short rib is usually thicker than we want for this style of rapid grilling or searing. The solution is to butterfly it, which you can see being demonstrated in a photo above in the recipe headnote.\nSkirt Steaks\nThe Latest\nSteaks\nSouth American",
