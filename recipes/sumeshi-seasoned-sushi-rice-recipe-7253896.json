  "full_text": "Sumeshi (Seasoned Sushi Rice)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nInfusing Time\n24 hrs\nTotal\n24 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nMakes\n2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\n(\n120\nml\n)\nunseasoned rice vinegar\n, such as Marukan Organic\n1/4\ncup\nplus\n1 1/2\ntablespoons\n(\n73\ng\n)\ngranulated sugar\n2\ntablespoons\n(\n18\ng\n) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; if using table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight\n1\n(\n2-inch-square) piece\nof\nkombu\n1\ncup\n(\n195\ng\n)\nshort-grain sushi rice\n(I recommend\nTamaki Gold Koshihikari\n)\n1\ncup\n(\n235\nml\n)\nfiltered water\n(or your favorite bottled brand)\nDirections\nFor the Sushi Vinegar:\nIn a stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the rice vinegar, salt, and sugar. Pour the solution into a nonreactive, airtight container and add kombu, making sure it is fully submerged. Allow kombu to infuse at room temperature for 24 hours.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Rice:\nThe next day, place rice in a large bowl and add enough cold water to cover. Using your fingers, gently massage and swish the grains in a circular motion until the water turns cloudy, about 30 seconds. Drain through a fine-mesh strainer, then refill the bowl with fresh water and repeat rinsing and draining until the water runs clear.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer rice to the fine-mesh strainer and set it atop the bowl used to rinse the rice. Run the rice under cold water for 2 to 3 minutes, allowing the bowl to overflow and spill over. Lightly agitate the rice as the water continues to run, which should help to filter out any small shards of broken rice grains (these can make sushi rice sticky/gummy if not removed, even if the rice is otherwise correctly cooked).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTurn off the water and empty the bowl. Allow the rice to drain and air dry in the strainer for 10 minutes with the empty bowl beneath to catch any excess water.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIf using a rice cooker,\nadd the rice and filtered water to the pot of a rice cooker and, using your fingers, evenly disperse the grains. If your cooker has a \u201csushi rice\u201d setting, set it to that and cook. Otherwise use the standard white rice setting.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIf cooking rice on the stove-top, place the rice and filtered water in a 2- to 3-quart heavy-bottomed pot and give the pot a good shake to level the rice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, lower to a gentle simmer, then cover and cook until water is fully absorbed, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the rice to steam, covered, for an additional 10 minutes.\nMeasure 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (50ml) sushi vinegar. Transfer hot rice into a wide, non-reactive container, such as a traditional wooden\nsushi oke/hangiri\nor 9-by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish; make sure not to transfer any crusty rice from the cooking pot (you can save this rice to be eaten separately, but it will ruin the sushi rice if not removed).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nHold a rice paddle or wooden spoon at a 45\u00ba angle above the rice. Slowly add the measured amount of sushi vinegar directly onto the paddle while waving the paddle back and forth to scatter and evenly distribute the vinegar onto the hot rice. Using long, sweeping strokes, smooth the rice into a flat even layer, gently breaking up any clumps as you go.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nOnce the rice is flat and all of the large clumps have been separated, push the rice into a pile on the side of the container nearest to you. Scoop the rice in small clusters, about the size of your paddle, and flip them towards the empty side of the container. Using swift cutting motions, gently break up the flipped clusters with your paddle as you go, specifically looking for small rice clumps. (These smaller clumps are unseasoned; separating and flipping the rice ensures each grain gets seasoned.) Continue this process until all of the grains have been separated and the rice is once again in a flat, even layer.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nRest the rice for 4 minutes. Using the paddle, flip the rice from top to bottom in small portions until all the rice has been flipped. Let rest an additional 2 minutes. This step ensures the seasoned vinegar is evenly distributed at all depths of the rice.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nThe rice is now ready to use. If you used a rice cooker, clean the pot, line it with a clean damp towel, transfer the rice back into it, and set the rice cooker to the \u201cwarm\u201d setting. Otherwise, cover the rice in the pot with a damp towel to prevent it from cooling too quickly and drying out. Use sushi rice as desired, preferably while still slightly warm.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nRice cooker or heavy-bottomed pot with lid,\nsushi oke or hangiri\nor a non-reactive container (such as a 9- by 13-inch baking dish), wooden spoon or plastic rice paddle\nNotes\nBe gentle when mixing the rice. Overmixing will result in extra sticky rice and smashed grains.\nIf your rice cools too much before serving, you can warm it in the microwave for a few seconds; slightly warm is preferable to serving the rice at room temperature. The temperature difference between the warm rice and cold fish adds to the eating experience. With overly cooled rice, the flavors are a bit muted and the texture of the rice is too firm.\nIf using a sushi oke or hangiri, make sure the bowl and paddle are moist before adding cooked rice to avoid grains sticking to the surface. To do this, fill the sushi oke or hangiri with warm water, discard it, then wipe up excess water with a clean towel before adding rice.\nUsing the crusty bits of rice on the bottom of the pot will result in unwanted clumps of rice. Discard them or set them aside for a crunchy snack.\nJapanese\nThe Latest\nWhite Rice\nJapanese Cuisine\nRice & Grains",
