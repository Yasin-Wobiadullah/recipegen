  "full_text": "How to Make Tahdig (Persian Crunchy Rice)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n75 mins\nSoaking and Resting Time\n2 hrs 5 mins\nTotal\n3 hrs 35 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nMakes\n4 cups of cooked rice\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\nbasmati rice\n(\n13 3/4\nounces\n;\n390\ng\n)\n6\ntablespoons\n(\n54\ng\n) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n, divided, plus more as needed; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight\n3\ntablespoons\n(\n42\ng\n)\nunsalted butter\n(see notes)\n2\ngenerous pinches\nground saffron\n(optional)\nDirections\nIn a large bowl, cover rice with enough cold water to cover by 1-inch. Using your hand, swirl the rice around until the water turns cloudy. Pour off the cloudy water through a fine-mesh strainer to catch any escaping rice, then return rice to bowl and refill with fresh cold water. Repeat the process until the water runs clear, about 5 or 6 times. Drain the washed rice well in the colander.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nReturn drained rice to large bowl along with 3 tablespoons (27g) salt. Add enough cold tap water to cover the rice by 1 inch. Gently stir to dissolve the salt. Let stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Drain in the small-hole colander.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nIn a large nonstick pot or enameled Dutch oven, bring 2 quarts (1.9L) water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add 3 tablespoons (27g) salt. Add drained rice, then gently stir to ensure that there is no clumped rice and there is no rice stuck to the bottom of the pot. Return to a vigorous boil, then cook until the the rice has grown 1.5 to 2 times in length and the outside of each grain is cooked but not mushy and the center of the grain shows some resistance, 5 to 8 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and drain through a small-hole colander.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nRinse rice well with cold water for about 30 seconds (you want to stop the cooking and to wash off any excess starch released during boiling). Taste a few grains of rice for saltiness; if more seasoning is desired, sprinkle rice all over with 1 teaspoon salt. In a small pot, combine butter with 1/3 cup (80ml) water and heat just until butter is melted. If using saffron, in a very small bowl, steep ground saffron in two tablespoons of hot water; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nWash the pot used to parboil the rice. Pour half of the water and butter mixture into the pot. Using a large spoon or a spatula, gently mound the parboiled rice into the center of the bottom of the pot; do not dump the rice from the colander. Instead, carefully build the mound up, making sure the rice forms a mountain shape and does not touch the sides of the pot. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make 6 to 8 holes deep into the mound including one in the center (this will facilitate the release of steam from the lower parts of the mound).\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nWrap the pot\u2019s lid in a clean, thick kitchen towel, then cover the pot tightly (wrapping the lid in a kitchen towel prevents steam from escaping and absorbs any moisture that would have condensed on the inside of the lid and dripped down on the rice). Set over medium-high heat (use a heat diffuser, if you have one, for more even browning) and cook until you can hear sizzling sounds inside the pot and steam begins to fill it (you can carefully lift the lid to peak if unsure), about 5 minutes. Uncover pot, gently pour the remaining water-butter mixture over the rice mound, then re-cover pot with the towel-wrapped lid. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, rotating the pot a quarter-turn every 10 to 15 minutes, until rice is tender and fluffy, about 45 minutes. Continue cooking about 10 minutes longer to help in the formation of the tahdig (you can go even longer for a thicker and crunchier tahdig, though it's best to lower the heat even further if you do so to minimize the risk of burning).\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nFill your sink with 1 inch cold water. Without taking the lid off the pot, set the rice pot immediately in the water filled sink (alternatively, set the pot on top of a thoroughly wet kitchen towel); this will help in getting the tahdig out. Let stand 4 minutes. Move the pot to your kitchen counter and carefully remove the lid (you want to avoid any hot steam that might come out, and also make sure not to let any condensed water drip down onto the rice mound).\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nUsing a slotted spoon or a spatula, and starting from the top of the mound of rice in the pot, gently spoon the rice onto the center of a serving platter to form a mound. After each spoonful, fluff the rice in the pot before transferring the next spoonful. Continue until you reach the near bottom of the pot where you may find a crunchy layer of rice; leave it in the pot for now. If using saffron, add 2 or 3 heaping tablespoons of cooked rice to the prepared saffron water and stir to evenly coat. Sprinkle the golden yellow grains of saffroned rice garnish on top of the mound of rice in the serving platter, then serve.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nIf using a nonstick pot, invert a round serving platter (slightly wider than the diameter of the pot) on top of the pot. Firmly grab both the serving platter and the pot and carefully but quickly flip them over together. Lift off the pot. The entire tahdig should have released from the bottom of the pot onto the serving platter in one piece. If you have not used a non-stick pot, there is still a chance that the tahdig may come out in one piece. Run a thin, flexible silicone spatula around the bottom of the pot to gently separate the edges of the tahdig from the side of the pot. Go around a couple of times, each time a bit deeper between the tahdig and the bottom of the pot. If you can feel that the entire tahdig has come loose, use the same flipping technique described above for a nonstick pot. If the tahdig is still stuck to the bottom of the pot (which is common), use a spoon or flat spatula to remove the tahdig in as large of pieces as possible. Arrange the crispy, beautiful, irresistible tahdig pieces on a separate small plate or arrange on the same serving platter as the fluffy rice.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer, small-hole colander, large pot (preferably nonstick or enameled cast iron), heat diffuser (optional but recommended)\nNotes\nThe recipe detailed above calls for using Indian or Pakistani basmati rice. If you happen to get your hands on rice grown in Iran, since their grains are harder than Indian and Pakistani basmati rice, increase the soaking time to four hours. If you use American basmati rice, since they are typically not aged, reduce the soaking time to 30 minutes.\nYou can substitute the butter with ghee or vegetable oil, if desired, though butter will yield the most aromatic and rich-tasting tahdig.\nThere are a few spots during the parboiling stage and the steaming stage where it is impossible to specify the exact timing due to variability in the type of rice that you might be using, the heat transfer properties of your cooking vessels, the settings of your burners, etc. That is why the recipe provides other means to monitor the cooking process: by tasting, by feeling, by biting, by listening, etc. For more consistent results, the first time you are making this recipe, you should take notes as to what you did, then note needed adjustments that will enhance the results based on what you're using in your kitchen. In addition, to ensure consistency, I always use the same burner on my home kitchen\u2019s stove to make chelow; I have even marked the control knob for that burner with additional indicators for better heat control, and always use the same two pots when making chelow to avoid any unnecessary variables.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nIf you don't have time to soak the rice for the recommended 2 hours, you can soak it for 1 hour instead.\nWhen I make tahdig and chelow (Persian rice) at home, I always make much more than I need for the immediate meal because if stored and warmed up properly, the aroma, texture and fluffiness of the leftover rice is nearly as good as freshly cooked chelow. As I wrote before, there's never any leftover tahdig, but you can store any leftover rice. To do so, remember that it's best not to put warm cooked rice directly into the refrigerator, as it will turn your leftovers into clumps. Instead, spread your leftover warm rice onto a baking sheet as close to a single layer as possible, let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then scoop into an airtight container. Refrigerate and use within 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months.\nNotes on Scaling Recipe\nWith regards to scaling the recipe for a smaller or larger amount of rice, use the following table:\nDry rice\n2 cups\n3 cups\n4 cups\nUnsalted butter\n3 tablespoons\n4 tablespoons\n6 tablespoons\nSalt for soaking\n3 tablespoons\n1/4 cup\n1/3 cup\nWater to prepare butter/water mixture\n1/3 cup\n1/2 cup\n2/3 cup\nSalt for parboiling\n4 quarts\n6 quarts\n8 quarts\nSalt, to taste\n1-2 teaspoons\n2-3 teaspoons\n3-4 teaspoons\nPreferred width of the pot for steaming (this will often be the same pot as parboiling)\n8-10 inches\n10 inches\n10 inches\nApproximate total steaming time\n50 minutes\n60 minutes\n70 minutes\nRead More\nChelow (Persian Steamed White Rice)\nThe Latest\nWhite Rice\nHow-Tos\nMiddle Eastern Cuisines\nRice & Grain Guides",
