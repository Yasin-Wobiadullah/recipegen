Empty into a small bowl and combine with turmeric, chili powder, and nutmeg, then set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Stew:\nSeason chicken all over with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken and cook, turning, until browned on both sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd onion to Dutch oven, lower heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring, until golden, about 10 minutes. Add carrots and cook for 4 minutes. Add chicken stock and dashi and bring to a simmer over high heat; reduce heat to maintain a simmer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCut up chicken into bite-size pieces and add back to pot, along with any accumulated juices. Add potatoes and apple and cook at a gentle simmer until potatoes are tender and carrots can easily be pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat until foaming. Stir in flour and cook, stirring, until roux is a deep caramel brown, about 20 minutes. Stir in ginger and 3 tablespoons (25g) curry spice blend and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nScrape roux into stew pot, stir well, and simmer until broth has thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in peas, if using, and cook until heated through.\nServe curry with cooked rice and pickled ginger and/or rakkyo.\nSpecial Equipment\nSpice grinder\n,\nDutch oven\nNotes\nIf you have cardamom pods, toast the pods first, then crack them to remove the seeds.\nYou can dry orange peels on a baking sheet in an oven set to its lowest setting; check them frequently, and remove when dehydrated.\nIf you don't have dashi, you can use the same volume of additional chicken stock to replace it.\nRead More\nTaste Test: Japanese Curry Roux Mixes\nJamaican Curry Chicken Recipe\nIndian Village (Gavthi) Chicken Curry Recipe\nBritish Curry Sauce Recipe\nA Guide to Thai Curry Varieties\nJapanese\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nBraised & Stewed Mains\nStovetop Chicken\nChicken Mains"
