Add the ground coriander and pink peppercorns and stir to incorporate for about 15 seconds.\nAdd the coconut milk, soy sauce, and rice wine, scraping the bottom of the skillet to remove any browned bits. Stir to combine and let it all come to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer for about half an hour, or until the sauce has thickened, the flavors have melded, and the meat is tender.\nRaise the heat to high and pour in the cornstarch mixture to let the sauce thicken, stirring, for about a minute. Taste for salt and sugar, then add the lime juice off the heat.\nAdd a good-sized ladle of sauce to a bowl of noodles, rice, or rice cakes, and garnish with some cilantro.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Pink Peppercorns\nCurries\nGround Beef\nCoconut Milk & Cream"
