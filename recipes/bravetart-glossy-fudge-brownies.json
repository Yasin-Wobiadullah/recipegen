Line a 9- by 13- by 2-inch anodized aluminum baking pan with foil to cover the bottom and long sides of the pan. (It's all right to leave the short sides exposed.) If you like, grease lightly with pan spray.\nIn a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, melt butter over medium-low heat. When it has completely melted, increase heat to medium and simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops. Continue cooking and stirring, scraping up any brown bits that form inside the pan, until butter is golden yellow and perfectly silent (see note). Remove from heat and stir in dark chocolate; the mixture will seem quite thin.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMaking the Batter:\nCombine granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, eggs, vanilla, and instant espresso (if using) in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on medium-high until extremely thick and fluffy, about 8 minutes. (The whipping time can vary significantly depending on bowl size, batter temperature, and mixer wattage, so use the visual cues as your primary guide.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, sift together flour and cocoa powder. When the foamed eggs are fluffy and thick, reduce speed to low and pour in the warm chocolate-butter. Once it is incorporated, add cocoa-flour mixture all at once and continue mixing until roughly combined. Finish with a flexible spatula, scraping and folding to ensure batter is well mixed from the bottom up.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPour into prepared pan and bake until brownies are glossy and just barely firm, about 30 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 205\u00b0F (96\u00b0C). (Take care that the probe is inserted at a sharp angle to avoid touching the bottom of the pan.) The timing of this recipe is based on anodized aluminum and will vary significantly with glass, ceramic, or nonstick pans, materials that will also affect the brownies' consistency.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCool brownies to room temperature to allow their crumb to set before slicing. Slide a butter knife between the brownies and the short ends of the pan; gently tug on the foil, then lift to remove the brownies from the pan. Cut into 24 two-and-a-half-inch squares and store in an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper between layers, about 1 week at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n,\nstand mixer\n,\n9- by 13- by 2-inch anodized aluminum baking pan\nNotes\nBrown butter\ncan burn when cooked too fast or too hot, or when not stirred frequently along the way; should this happen to you, simply strain the brown butter before use to remove the bitter, burned milk solids.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStored in an airtight container, with a sheet of wax paper between the layers, the brownies will keep about 1 week at room temperature.\nRead More\nVegan Brownies\nChocolate\nDesserts\nBaking\nDessert Bars\nValentine's Day"
