Remove to a paper towel to drain, and season with sea salt.\nWhile the chicken is frying, making the sauce by melting the butter in a small sauce pan over medium low heat. Then add the honey and two mustards, and heat through, so the honey is thoroughly runny and melted.\nPlace the sauce in a large bowl, and add the drummettes. Toss to thoroughly coat.\nArrange the chicken on a Silpat- or parchment-lined baking sheet. Spoon any extra sauce over the top, and bake for 10 minutes. You can easily double or triple this recipe to feed a crowd.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nChicken\nSuper Bowl",
