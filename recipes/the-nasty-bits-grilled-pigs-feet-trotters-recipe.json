Loosely pour the kecap manis and the sriracha over the trotters. Add the salt and water and cover the pan.\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C). Braise the trotters for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until they are very tender but not falling off the bone. Let cool briefly.\nMeanwhile, start your grill. Arrange your briquets on one side of the grill or in a pile in the middle, so that there's plenty of room on the grill to indirectly cook the trotters. When the briquets have ashed over and are glowing red, arrange the braised trotters on the grate, skin side down.\nGrill for 25 to 35 minutes, turning the trotters occasionally to check that the skins aren't burning. Serve immediately with the sauce on the side.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\ngrill\n,\nchimney starter\nRead More\nHow to Get Started Grilling\nThe Nasty Bits: Whole Hock Recipe\nA Healthy Jar of Trotter Gear Recipe\nCrispy Grilled Pig's Tails Recipe\nPig's Ears Two Ways Recipe\nPork\nRoasted Pork",
