Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the bit of cheesecloth or paper towel that touches the bottom and sides of the mold with water. This will allow you to nestle the cheesecloth or paper into the shape of the heart more easily.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat cream cheese on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. With mixer on medium-low speed, gradually add in a third of the heavy cream; whisk until smooth and combined, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Gradually add remaining cream; increase speed to medium and whisk until just before the mixture looks like whipped cream. Add powdered sugar, vanilla bean seeds, and lemon zest and whisk until the mixture resembles whipped cream.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nDivide cream cheese mixture evenly between prepared molds, spreading in an even layer. Fold the excess cheesecloth or paper towel over the top, and set the mold on a rimmed baking sheet to catch the liquid that will drain out. (If your molds don\u2019t have feet to keep them raised, place molds on a wire rack to keep them suspended over the baking sheet.) Chill in refrigerator overnight.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nTo make the sauce, combine strawberries, water, sugar, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over high heat, and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the sugar is dissolved and the strawberries are soft.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nUse an immersion blender, or a regular blender, to puree the sauce. Strain it through a fine-mesh sieve, and loosely cover. Chill until cold.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nInvert the molds into individual, shallow bowls. Pour about 1/3 to 1/2 cup strawberry sauce around the outside, so each heart is floating in a pool of red sauce. Serve immediately with any extra sauce, or reserve sauce for another use (see note.)\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nSpecial Equipment\ntwo 4-inch Coeur \u00e0 la Cr\u00e8me molds\nNotes\nIf you don\u2019t have Coeur \u00e0 la Cr\u00e8me molds, you can use 2 medium fine-mesh sieves instead. Line and fill strainers as directed; place each over a medium bowl to catch any liquid that will drain out. Finish and serve as directed. The presentation may not be quite the same, but the flavors and textures will still be exceptional.\nExtra strawberry sauce is great for spooning over ice cream, yogurt, parfaits and more.\nValentine's Day"
