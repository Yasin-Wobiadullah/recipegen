Bring 3 quarts (2.8L) water to a boil to use in a water bath during baking.\nIn a 2-quart saucepan, place sugar over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly with a fork, until sugar melts and syrup is a deep copper brown color, about 5 minutes. Carefully pour the hot caramel into an oven-safe 8-inch square baking dish, making sure the bottom is evenly coated with caramel. Set aside.\nRezel Kealoha\nIn a medium mixing bowl, whisk together egg yolks, evaporated milk, condensed milk, and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl (this ensures that your flan will be smooth).\nRezel Kealoha\nPour egg mixture into the prepared caramel-lined dish. Tap dish gently on a work surface to pop any bubbles. Sprinkle lemon zest evenly over top and cover with foil. With the tip of a sharp knife, poke 2 1/2-inch slits in the foil so moisture can escape and won\u2019t condense onto your flan as it bakes.\nRezel Kealoha\nIn a roasting dish, casserole dish, or another high-walled, oven-safe dish, set a wire rack in the bottom and place the foil-covered flan-filled dish on top. Place in oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting dish until about halfway up the side of the flan-filled dish.\nRezel Kealoha\nBake until flan is just set to the touch, with a slight jiggle in the center, and an instant read thermometer reads 175\u00b0F (80\u00b0C) in the center, about 1 hour.\nRezel Kealoha\nTransfer flan to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cool fully in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight.\nTo serve, run a paring knife or offset spatula along the edge to loosen the flan from the dish. Set a larger plate, upside down, on top of flan-filled dish, then quickly flip both dishes over to invert the flan and catch the caramel sauce. Slice into 36 one-inch squares and serve.\nRezel Kealoha\nSpecial Equipment\nOven-safe 8-inch square baking dish,\nwire rack\n,\nlarge roasting pan\nMake-ahead and Storage\nLeche flan can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.\nFilipino\nBaking\nEggs\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nThe Latest"
