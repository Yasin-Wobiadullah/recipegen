Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and espresso; set aside.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream butter, brown sugar, and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg. Add dry ingredients and mix on low speed until evenly combined. mix in toffee bits. Drop dough by the rounded tablespoon onto prepared baking sheets. Bake until cookies are just starting to get golden at the edges, 14 to 18 minutes. Allow to cool slightly and serve.\nNotes\nI used HEATH BITS O' BRICKLE Toffee Bits. If you can't find them, you can replace them with either a crushed Heath or Skor Bar (if you don't mind adding chocolate) or butterscotch chips (which also won't be exactly the same.) Either way, I'd suggest chopping the replacement toffee finely, as the Heath Bits are exactly that: super small crumbs of toffee that keep these cookies from being chunky.\nI used Medaglia D'oro Instant Espresso, which can be found in some supermarkets or online. I really recommend keeping some in your pantry\u2014a teaspoon will boost the flavor of most any chocolate dessert.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer, baking sheet, parchment paper\nCookies",
