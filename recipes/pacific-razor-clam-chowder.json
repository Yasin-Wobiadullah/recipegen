Using a slotted spoon, transfer half the bacon to a paper towel\u2013lined plate; reserve for garnish.\nAdd the leek to the remaining bacon in the Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the diced celery, bay leaves, thyme, and cayenne and cook for 1 minute. Add the potatoes and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook the potatoes for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nAdd the vermouth and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the clam juice and just enough water to cover the potatoes (about 8 ounces/240ml). Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, then cook until the potatoes are tender. Add the cream, return to a simmer, then simmer for 10 minutes. Bring the chowder to a boil, turn off the heat, add the razor clam meat, cover the pot, and let stand for 1 minute; this will be enough to gently poach the clam meat without letting it become rubbery. Add fish sauce, if using. Season with salt.\nLadle soup into bowls and top with reserved bacon and celery leaves. Serve, allowing diners to add hot sauce and crumbled crackers to their bowls as desired.\nSpecial equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nIf you\u2019re shucking fresh razor clams for this recipe, you can collect and strain any liquid from that process and substitute it for part of the bottled clam juice.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFat, Ugly, and Delicious: A Guide to the Pacific Razor Clam\nSoups\nStovetop Seafood\nClams\nFall Snacks & Appetizers\nWinter Snacks & Appetizers",
