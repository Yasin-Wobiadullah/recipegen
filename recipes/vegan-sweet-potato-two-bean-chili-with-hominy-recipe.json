Toast, stirring and flipping the chiles occasionally, until pliable, lightly puffed, and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add stock, raisins, and orange juice, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chiles are fully hydrated and tender, about 15 minutes. Drain chiles and raisins, reserving water separately. Transfer chiles to a blender or hand blender cup. Add chipotles and their sauce. Blend until completely smooth.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nHeat oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and poblanos and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and dried oregano and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add pur\u00e9ed chiles, soy sauce, and Marmite, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add reserved chile soaking liquid, tomatoes, kidney beans, black beans, hominy, and sweet potatoes. Stir to combine and season with salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nBring to a boil over high heat, reduce to lowest heat, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sweet potatoes are fully tender and flavor has developed, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, adding more liquid as necessary if chili threatens to scorch.\nWhen cooked, add vodka or bourbon and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and whisk in masa in a slow steady stream until desired thickness is reached. For best results, allow chili to cool and refrigerate for at least one night and up to a week. Reheat to serve.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nServe, garnished with cilantro, chopped onions, scallions, avocado, lime wedges, and warm tortillas as desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nor\nimmersion blender\nNotes\nMasa harina is a dried corn flour used to make tortillas and other corn-based Mexican dishes. It can be found under the brand name Maseca.\nRead More\nThe Best Vegetarian Bean Chili Recipe\nBasic Chili Paste to Replace Chili Powder Recipe\nVegan Frito Pie Recipe\nThe Best Chili Ever Recipe\nDairy-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop\nBlack Beans"
