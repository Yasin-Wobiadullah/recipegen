Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring, until translucent but not browned, about 2 minutes.\nAdd rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.)\nAdd sake and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and miso paste.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd stock and scrape any grains of rice or pieces of shallot or garlic from the sides of the pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker, either by using the steam-release valve (if it has one) or running it under cold water (if it does not; do not run an electric pressure cooker under running water).\nOpen pressure cooker, add lemon juice, and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to form a creamy consistency. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more; it should look like a smooth, creamy sauce. Season to taste with salt (if necessary), stir in chives or scallions, and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / J.
