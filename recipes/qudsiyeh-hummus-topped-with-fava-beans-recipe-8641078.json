Let soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse beans thoroughly. (See notes if using canned fava beans.)\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn a 4-quart pot or Dutch oven, combine beans and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover beans with 2 inches water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat as needed to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender and almost falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Stir occasionally and top off with more water as needed; they should be submerged at all times. (See notes.)\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nWhen the beans are cooked, set aside 1 cup cooking liquid. Using a colander, drain beans. Using a mortar and pestle or potato masher, coarsely mash the beans, adding more reserved water, one tablespoon at a time, if necessary, to form a chunky pur\u00e9e. (You don\u2019t want a smooth paste and you should still see plenty of partially broken down beans; see notes if using canned beans).\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor the Lemon Dressing:\nMeanwhile, In a small bowl, stir together garlic, chile, lemon juice, and olive oil, and season to taste with salt. Set aside. (See notes.)\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor Serving:\nFill a shallow bowl with hummus b\u2019tahini and, using the back of a spoon, form a well in the center. Spoon the mashed fava beans into the well, forming a mound. Pour the lemon dressing on top and drizzle with more olive oil. Sprinkle with parsley, if using, and serve with pita, sliced tomatoes, onions, and pickles.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\n4-quart pot or Dutch oven, colander, mortar and pestle or potato masher\nNotes\nIn general, mini fava beans tend to be sturdier than large ones so they won\u2019t become too mushy when cooked. One can of plain ful mudammas (small fava beans) can be substituted for 1/2 cup dried fava beans. Sizes of cans vary from 14 to 16 ounces; all work in this recipe.\nIf using canned beans: pour contents of the cans into a small pot. Bring to a boil over high heat and heat beans are warmed through. Proceed with the rest of step 4. Season to taste with salt.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe fava beans can be cooked up to two days in advance and stored in their liquid. Reheat and proceed with recipe from step 3. The finished dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nHummus\nThe Latest\nMiddle Eastern\nVegetarian\nVegan",
