(If using fully stale and dried bread, skip baking step.) Arrange bread in single layer on rimmed baking sheet, and bake until completely dried, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and allow to cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Transfer bread to food processor bowl (set aside but don't clean rimmed baking sheet), and pulse until reduced to small crumbs, taking care not to over-process into a fine powder, 8 to 10 pulses.\nCombine breadcrumbs and 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a large skillet, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring and tossing occasionally, until crisp and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer toasted breadcrumbs to reserved rimmed baking sheet, spread into an even layer, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Once cool, set aside 1/2 cup (60g) toasted breadcrumbs for the pasta, and transfer remaining crumbs to an airtight container for future use; the extra breadcrumbs can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.\nFor the Pasta:\nBring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat, and season very lightly with salt; use a ratio of 1 tablespoon (12g) of Diamond Crystal kosher salt per 1 gallon (4L) of water.\nMeanwhile, in a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons (45ml) oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add anchovies and cook, stirring and breaking up anchovies occasionally with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, until anchovies have dissolved, about 4 minutes. Add tomato estratto or paste, stir to combine with allium-anchovy mixture, and continue to cook until mixture turns dark brick red and is very dry, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer 1 cup (240ml) boiling water from pot to skillet to loosen tomato-anchovy mixture, and stir until it becomes homogenous and saucy. Reduce heat on skillet to lowest possible setting, to just keep sauce warm; if your burner can only be reduced to a simmer, then turn heat off entirely.\nCook pasta in the pot of boiling water until just softened on the exterior, but well shy of al dente, and still uncooked in the center (2 to 3 minutes less than the package directs). Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 1 cup (240ml) pasta cooking water.\nIncrease heat to high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce coats noodles and just pools around the edges of the pan, about 2 minutes, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed. Add raisins and pine nuts (if using), half of the breadcrumbs (1/4 cup; 30g), and toss to combine. Pasta should be well-coated but not swimming in sauce (this dish is meant to have a slightly drier consistency than typical sauced pastas). Adjust sauce consistency as needed with more pasta water if it seems too dry, or an additional small handful of breadcrumbs if it seems too loose. Remove from heat, divide pasta between individual serving bowls, sprinkle with remaining breadcrumbs, and serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nfood processor\n,\nlarge skillet\nNotes\nMuddica atturrata (toasted breadcrumbs) are traditionally made with pangrattato\u2014breadcrumbs made by processing stale bread. This recipe is written to make extra toasted breadcrumbs from fresh or stale bread (we used sourdough b\u00e2tard during recipe testing, but most types of white bread will work fine) because if you are taking the time to make your own breadcrumbs, you might as well make a big batch so you have some ready to go in your pantry for future use. If you don't want to make your own breadcrumbs, you can substitute 1/2 cup (35g) panko breadcrumbs, and toast them with oil as written in the recipe.\nBoth salt-packed and oil-packed anchovies will work for this recipe. If using firmer salt-packed anchovies, cut them into 1/2-inch pieces before cooking, as this will help them break down more quickly. If using tomato estratto, use 10 fillets (40g). If using tomato paste, use 12 fillets (50g), to compensate for the increased sweetness and diminished savoriness of the tomato product.\nSicilian tomato estratto is made by sun-drying milled tomatoes on wooden tables or terra cotta trays for about 1 week to produce a super-concentrated paste that is sometimes homogenized with a small amount of extra-virgin olive oil. While similar in appearance to tomato paste, estratto has a much more intense savory flavor, and a drier texture. It is a key component to this dish and worth seeking out, but it is an expensive specialty product. As a result, I have provided instructions for making this recipe with more affordable tomato paste. Tomato paste is much sweeter and has a more forward, bright, fresh tomato flavor. For this reason, if using tomato paste, the amount of anchovies should be increased to 12 fillets, and the golden raisins should be left out. The dish won't have quite the same savory punch when made with regular tomato paste, but it will still be very tasty.\nRaisins and pine nuts are important ingredients in Sicilian cuisine; they provide pops of sweetness/nuttiness and textural contrast in dishes like\npasta con le sarde\nand\ncaponata\n, as well as this pasta. That said, if you don't have them on hand, you can certainly do without them in this recipe without worrying about ruining the dish. No need to make a special run to the grocery store for 1 tablespoon of each.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe toasted breadcrumbs can be made up to 2 weeks in advance and stored in an airtight container at room temperature. The cooked allium-anchovy-tomato mixture (prior to loosening with cooking water) can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 7 days, though there is no real need to do that.\nRead More\nPasta Burro e Alici (Pasta With Creamy Anchovy-Butter Sauce\nPasta al Tonno (Pasta With Tomatoes and Tuna)\nSicilian-Style Spaghetti Alla Carrettiera (Fresh Tomato and Garlic Sauce)\nPasta With Spicy 'Nduja-Tomato Sauce\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine\nAnchovies\nTomato Sauces"
