When buying scallops, look for never-frozen \"dry\" scallops that are sold as-is from the ocean. If they are un-labeled, look for the telltale milky white liquid: if the scallops have any liquid pooled around them, they are wet scallops and you should not use them. If dry scallops are unavailable, any sashimi-grade fish can be used in their place.\nScallops\nThe Latest\nItalian\nSnacks & Appetizers\nRecipes",
