Working in batches if necessary, transfer asparagus to basket in a single layer, and cook until asparagus is browned in a few spots and tender-crisp, 5 to 10 minutes (see notes).\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nSpecial Equipment\nAir fryer\nNotes\nIf asparagus is too long to fit in the air fryer, halve it crosswise.\nI recommend using asparagus that is at least 1/2-inch thick. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the asparagus\nWe recommend using a 6-quart or larger air fryer. If using a smaller air fryer, you may need to cook the asparagus in batches to ensure even cooking and spacing.\nAsparagus\nThe Latest\nVegetable Sides\nVegetables\nAir Fryer Recipes"
