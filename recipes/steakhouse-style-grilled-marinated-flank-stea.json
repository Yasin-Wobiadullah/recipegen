Transfer 1/3 of marinade to a small container, add chives and shallots, stir to combine, and reserve. Place flank steak inside a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with remaining marinade.

Remove steak from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Add steak to pan and cook, turning frequently, until an instant-read thermometer registers 125\u00b0F for medium-rare, or 135\u00b0F for medium, reducing heat as necessary if steak smokes excessively or starts to burn. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and allow to rest 5 to 10 minutes. Carve and serve, passing extra marinade tableside.\nNotes\nIf you're using a gas grill, set half of the burners to high and leave the others off for two-zone grilling.\nAn equivalent weight of skirt, flap, or hanger steak can be used in place of flank steak.\nRead More\nGrilled Marinated Flank Steak Fajitas\nThai-Style Marinated Flank Steak and Herb Salad\nGrilled Steaks\nFlank Steaks\nBeef Mains\nSummer Mains"
