  "full_text": "Instant Coffee Granola\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nCooling Time\n2 hrs\nTotal\n2 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n5 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2 cup (\n120\nml\n)\nagave syrup\n, see notes\n3\ntablespoons\ninstant\ncoffee granules\ndissolved in 1 1/2 tablespoons hot tap water\n1\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\n1/2\nteaspoon\nground\ncinnamon\n1/2\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\n1/3\ncup\n(80ml) melted refined\ncoconut oil\n, see notes\n2 1/2 cups\nold-fashioned rolled oats\n(about\n9\nounces\n; 260g)\n1 cup whole raw skin-on\nalmonds\n, roughly chopped (about\n3 3/4\nounces\n; 110g)\n1/2 cup\npepitas\n(about\n2 3/4\nounces\n; 80g)\n1 tablespoon\nchia seeds\n(about\n1/2\nounce\n; 13g)\n1/2\ncup\ndried fruit\n(about 2 3/4 ounces; 75g), such as prunes, dried apricots, or dried cherries, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 300\u00baF (150\u00baC) degrees. Line a 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nIn a large bowl, whisk agave syrup, dissolved instant coffee, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt to combine. Whisk in melted coconut oil to combine. (The coconut oil may separate a bit from the coffee syrup\u2014this is OK.)\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nAdd oats, almonds, pepitas, and chia seeds to agave and coffee mixture. Using a flexible spatula, toss to evenly coat ingredients in syrup. Transfer granola onto prepared baking sheet, and, using the same spatula, spread into an even layer. Transfer to oven and bake until fragrant, toasted, golden brown, and mostly dry to the touch, about 40 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nTurn oven off, and leave the granola in the warm oven to cool completely, about 2 hours. Remove granola from oven and, using your hands, break granola into small clumps and toss with dried fruit in the sheet pan. Transfer granola to an airtight container and store at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Kanika and Jatin Sharma\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet, parchment paper, flexible spatula\nNotes\nI use agave syrup for its mostly neutral flavor. You can substitute with other liquid sweeteners like maple syrup or honey, but they will impart their flavors to the granola. (Maple or honey latte granola, anyone?) Do not substitute with brown sugar or granulated sugar\u2014you\u2019ll end up with powdery and unpleasantly dry granola.\nBe sure to use refined coconut oil, as unrefined oil will give the granola a strong coconut flavor. Any neutral oil (like vegetable or canola) can be substituted for coconut oil.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nGranola can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.\nGranola\nThe Latest\nSnacks & Appetizers\nBreakfast & Brunch\nCoffee",
