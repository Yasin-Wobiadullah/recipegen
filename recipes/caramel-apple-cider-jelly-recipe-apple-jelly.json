  "full_text": "Caramel Apple Cider Jelly Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n30 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nCooling Time\n6 hrs\nTotal\n6 hrs 40 mins\nServes\n24 servings\nMakes\n6 half-pint jars\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n5\ncups\napple cider\n1\ncinnamon\nstick\n1\nstrip lemon or\norange zest\n1/2\nteaspoon\nwhole cloves\n2\ncups\ngranulated sugar\n1\npackage\nlow or no sugar needed\npowdered pectin\n(such as Ball)\n1\ncup packed\nbrown sugar\nDirections\nIf you are going to preserve the jelly, prepare the jars and lids: place six half-pint jars on a rack in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the jars, and bring to boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes, then turn off heat and allow the jars to rest in the hot water. Meanwhile, put bands and lids in a small saucepan and cover with water. Heat over medium heat until the water is simmering, then remove the pan from heat and allow the bands and lids to rest in hot water until ready to use.\nMeasure 1/4 cup of granulated sugar into a small bowl and add the pectin. In another medium bowl, combine the remaining 1 3/4 cups of granulated sugar and the brown sugar. Set aside.\nPour the apple cider into a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Tie the cinnamon stick, lemon zest, and cloves in piece of cheesecloth and add it to the pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the sugar-pectin mixture and return to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly. Stir in remaining sugar mixture and return to a full rolling boil. Boil hard for one minute.\nRemove the pot from the heat and discard the cheesecloth. Skim any foam from the surface of the jelly with a cold metal spoon.\nLadle the hot jam into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe rims of the jars, cover with lids, and screw bands on until just barely tight. Place jars on rack in pot and cover completely with water. Cover pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Turn off heat, uncover pot, and allow jars to rest in water for five minutes. Remove jars from pot and allow them to rest undisturbed on countertop for six hours or overnight.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nPreserved: Caramel Apple Cider Jelly\nJams & Jellies"
