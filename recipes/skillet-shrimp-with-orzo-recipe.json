Add the orzo and cook according package instructions until it\u2019s al dente. Drain and set aside, transfer to a bowl, and toss with a little vegetable or canola oil.\nWipe out skillet and return to medium high heat. Add oil and heat until shimmering. Add garlic and chili flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the asparagus, season with salt and pepper and stir to coat the asparagus. Cook until the asparagus is tender but retains a crisp bite, 3 to 4 minutes. Move the asparagus to the sides of the pan and add the shrimp. Cook, turning shrimp occasionally, until pink and opaque, about 4 minutes total.\nAdd the orzo back to the pan, stirring to combine, along with most of the basil, the lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil and feta. Toss to combine, allow orzo to heat through, season to taste with more salt and pepper as desired, and serve immediately, topped with remaining basil.\nSeafood Mains\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop\nShrimp\nAsparagus",
