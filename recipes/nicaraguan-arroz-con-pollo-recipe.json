Squeeze lime juice into pot and add juiced lime halves to pot. Bring to boil over medium heat, then immediately reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nUsing tongs, transfer chicken to a large bowl. Once cool enough to handle, shred chicken into bite-sized pieces, removing and discarding bones; you should have 4 cups of shredded chicken. Strain broth (discarding solids) and reserve 4 cups of broth; set aside (store the rest for another use).\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor the rice:\nWipe out the Dutch oven, add 2 tablespoons butter, and melt over medium heat. Add oil, onion, garlic, and salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until darkened, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nStir in rice and carrots and cook, stirring, until rice is completely coated with onion mixture, about 1 minute. Add reserved broth and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Continue to boil until most of the liquid has evaporated and you can see small bubbles on the surface of the rice. Reduce heat to the lowest setting, cover, and cook until rice is done, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff rice with chopsticks or fork, and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor the Arroz Con Pollo:\nIn a large skillet with high sides, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add sausage and ham and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nMelt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in now-empty skillet. Add onion and peppers and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until darkened, about 1 minute. Add ketchup and reserved shredded chicken and cook, stirring, until chicken is completely coated in mixture.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nStir in reserved rice, then reserved sausage and ham mixture. Stir in olives, capers, and peas. Cook, stirring occasionally to allow flavors to meld, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nServe warm with grated parmesan cheese and buttered white toast, if using, alongside.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n, large skillet with high sides\nNotes\nThis recipe can be cut in half. For a quicker version of this recipe: Buy a rotisserie chicken (you'll need about 4 cups of shredded chicken) and low-sodium chicken broth instead of poaching your own chicken and making your own broth. Rather than cooking the diced carrots with the rice, substitute them and the frozen peas with 2 1/2 cups of frozen peas-and-carrots.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe chicken and rice may be cooked 2 days in advance. To store, place chicken and 3 cups strained broth in airtight container and refrigerate. Refrigerate rice in an airtight container.\nRead More\nArroz Aguado (Nicaraguan Chicken and Rice Stew)\nChicken Mains\nCentral American\nStovetop Chicken\nWhole Chicken\nWhite Rice",
