Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nWhile pumpkins are roasting, cut remaining pumpkin quarter into 1/2-inch dice. Melt butter in a large skillet over high heat, swirling until foaming subsides. Add diced pumpkin and apple and cook, tossing and stirring frequently until tender and browned on most sides, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper; stir in minced sage. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nWhen toppings are ready, adjust oven rack to top position under broiler and place a baking steel or pizza stone on top. Preheat oven to maximum heat setting. Allow to preheat for 30 minutes.\nTransfer one ball of pizza dough to a bowl of flour and turn to coat. Transfer to a lightly floured wooden pizza peel and stretch or roll into a thin circle. Top with half of shredded Gruy\u00e8re cheese, half of the mozzarella applied in dollops, and a light sprinkling of Parmesan. Add mashed pumpkin in rough dollops around the cheese. Add half of saut\u00e9ed pumpkin and apple. Sprinkle with torn sage leaves and half the scallion whites. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt. Turn broiler on to high and launch pizza onto baking steel. Bake, rotating occasionally, until puffy and charred around the edges, about 4 minutes. Remove from oven, sprinkle with half the pale-green scallions, and serve. Repeat with remaining dough and toppings.\nSerious Eats / J.
