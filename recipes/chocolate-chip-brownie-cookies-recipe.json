On low speed stir in chocolate mixture and vanilla until combined.\nIn small bowl whisk flour with baking powder. Stir into chocolate mixture. Chill until firm enough to scoop, about 30 minutes. Fold in chocolate chips (see note).\nAdjust oven rack to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop 1/4-cup balls onto sheets, spacing at least 2 inches apart (about 7 per pan). Bake until puffed and just beginning to crack, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on the pan 5 minutes, then gently transfer to wire rack.\nSpecial Equipment\nMixer\nNotes\nI fold in the chocolate chips after chilling just to make sure the batter won't melt the chips. 1/2 cup chopped walnuts are a good addition to this recipe.\nCookies\nChocolate"
