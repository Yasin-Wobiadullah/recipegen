  "full_text": "Black Olive Tapenade With Garlic, Capers, and Anchovies Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nMakes\n1 cup\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\npitted black\nolives, such as Ni\u00e7oise or\noil-cured olives\n1\ntablespoon\ndrained\ncapers\n2\ndrained\noil-packed anchovy\nfillets\n3\nmedium cloves\ngarlic\n5\nbasil\nleaves\n(optional)\n1\ntablespoon\nloosely packed fresh oregano\n, marjoram, or thyme leaves\n1\nteaspoon\nDijon mustard\n1\nteaspoon\nfresh juice\nfrom\n1\nlemon\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n, as needed\nKosher salt\nand freshly ground black pepper, if needed\nDirections\nIf using a food processor:\nCombine olives, capers, anchovies, garlic, basil (if using), other herbs, and mustard in the work bowl and process, scraping down the sides, until a finely chopped paste forms. Process in lemon juice. With the processor running, drizzle in just enough olive oil to loosen to a spreadable paste, about 2 tablespoons. Season with salt and pepper only if needed.\nIf using a mortar and pestle:\nRoughly chop olives, capers, anchovies, and garlic, then add to mortar with basil (if using) and other herbs. Tap, crush, and smash with pestle until ingredients have been reduced to a thick paste (a little chunkiness is okay). Using pestle, work in mustard and lemon juice, then drizzle in just enough olive oil to form a spreadable paste, about 2 tablespoons. Season with salt and pepper only if needed.\nSpecial equipment\nFood processor\nor mortar and pestle\nNotes\nIf you're pressed for time, use the food processor method; it will yield a uniformly blended olive spread with lots of chopped little bits. If you have the time and inclination, use a mortar and pestle: It takes longer and requires some elbow grease, but you'll be rewarded with superior flavor and texture.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nA Tale of Two Tapenades (and How to Make Them)\nDips\nFrench\nAnchovies\nGarlic",
