Line a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with foil; place milk bread on lined baking sheet and toast until lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes each side. Remove and set aside to cool, leaving oven on.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nIn a small skillet, combine olive oil and grated garlic. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ketchup, oregano, and basil. Increase heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, until the ketchup thickens and darkens slightly in color, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nUsing an offset spatula or butter knife, spread sauce evenly across toasted milk. Top each slice of bread with 1/4 cup cheese. Divide onions, mushrooms, ham, green bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes evenly among slices of bread, and top each slice with 1/4 cup cheese.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nBake until cheese is golden brown and cherry tomatoes soften slightly, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nSpecial Equipment\n13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet, offset spatula or butter knife\nNotes\nThis recipe can easily be scaled up or down based on your desired quantity of pizza toasts.\nWhile diced ham is most common, mini pepperoni or thinly sliced cocktail sausages are also delicious options, and 1/2 cup of either can be substituted for the 1/2 cup of ham.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPizza toast is best eaten immediately.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nSnacks & Appetizers\nJapanese\nMozzarella",
