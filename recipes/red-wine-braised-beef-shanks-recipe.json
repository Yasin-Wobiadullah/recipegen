Season shank steaks all over with salt and pepper. In a large heavy roasting pan (alternatively, you can use 2 large pots such as Dutch ovens or straight-sided saut\u00e9 pans, splitting ingredients between them), heat oil over high heat until shimmering. Add steaks, in batches, if necessary, and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a platter.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nLower heat to medium-high and add onions, carrots, and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add wine, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to a simmer; lower heat to medium and cook until raw alcohol smell has mostly cooked off, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nAdd thyme and bay leaves. Nestle shank steaks in cooking liquid so that they are almost but not completely submerged; pour any accumulated juices from steaks into the roasting pan. Cover with aluminum foil. Transfer to oven and braise until shanks are tender, about 3 1/2 hours, removing foil after 1 1/2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nDiscard foil and transfer shanks to a clean platter. Skim rendered fat off surface of braising liquid and discard thyme and bay leaves. Using an immersion blender or blender, blend aromatics and braising liquid to form a smooth sauce. Thin with warm water or stock as needed to create a consistency just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add soy sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nServe shanks with sauce, sprinkling parsley on top. Shanks can be refrigerated in their sauce for up to 4 days. Reheat before serving, and thinning reheated sauce if necessary with water.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nRoasting pan\nor 2 pots (such as\nDutch oven\nand/or straight-sided\nsaut\u00e9 pan\n),\nimmersion blender\nor\nstanding blender\nRead More\nShould You Really Only Cook With Wine You'd Drink?\nCoq au Vin (Chicken Braised in Red Wine)\nOsso Buco (Italian Braised Veal Shanks)\nBeef Mains\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nBeef\nMother's Day\nFather's Day",
