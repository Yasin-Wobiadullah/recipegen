  "full_text": "Quick One Pot Hungarian Chicken and Noodles With Cabbage Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n25 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n25 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\ntablespoons\n(\n1 1/2\nounces\n)\nunsalted butter\n2\nmedium\nonions\n, finely chopped (about\n2\ncups\n)\nKosher salt\nand freshly\nground black pepper\n1/2\nteaspoon\ncaraway seeds\n1\npound\nground chicken\n1\nsmall head\ncabbage\n(about\n1\npound\n), quartered, cored, sliced into 1-inch strips\n1 1/2\ncups\nlow-sodium homemade or store-bought\nlow-sodium chicken stock\n5\nounces\negg noodles\n1/3\ncup\nfresh parsley\nleaves, chopped\n4 to 6\ntablespoons\nsour cream\n, optional (see notes)\nDirections\nHeat butter in a skillet over medium heat until melted. Add onions and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until onions have softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in caraway seeds and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nAdd chicken and cook, stirring, until chicken is no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cabbage and cook until wilted to about half its volume, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, another teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to simmer. Nestle in egg noodles, cover, and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until noodles are cooked but still quite firm, 5 to 6 minutes.\nRemove from heat, stir in parsley, stir in sour cream (if using), season to taste and serve. Broth will thicken slightly upon resting.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet with lid\nNotes\nWhen covering with lid, leave slightly askew to allow some steam to escape and to keep mixture from boiling over. I like this dish with clean flavors, but for a creamier and richer, though more muted flavor, stir in the sour cream at the end.\nPasta Mains\nStovetop Pasta\nChicken\nEgg Noodles\nCabbage",
