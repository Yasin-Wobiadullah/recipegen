Add half of the beef, spreading it out in a single layer. Season lightly with salt and pepper and cook without moving until lightly browned on first side, about 1 minute. Toss and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until fully browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining beef.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nAfter all meat has been removed from the pan, lower the heat to medium and if skillet is dry, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil if necessary. Add onions and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nStir in the garam masala, garlic, and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring to incorporate, until paste darkens, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nAdd tomatoes, stir to combine and cook, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes break down and vegetables soften into a cohesive, slightly chunky sauce, 7 to 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nOnce the sauce has thickened and the vegetables are cooked down, toss the seared beef back into the skillet, stirring to coat the meat in the sauce. Cook until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nStir in cilantro just before serving. Serve with ugali or white rice.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch stainless-steel skillet\nNotes\nFor extra richness, you can substitute a portion of the tomato with beef broth or finish the sauce with a few tablespoons of coconut milk.\nFor grating the garlic and ginger, I recommend using a microplane.\nFor added spice, add a mild chili or chili flakes when adding the garlic.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBeef wet fry is best served fresh but can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a skillet on the stovetop, adding a splash of water or broth if needed to create a saucy texture.\nBeef Mains\nThe Latest\nEast African\nBeef Stir-Fry\nKenyan",
