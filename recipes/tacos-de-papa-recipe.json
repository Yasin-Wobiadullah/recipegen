Add pickled jalape\u00f1o, chopped chipotles, and adobo sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce begins to fry, about 1 minute. Add potatoes, capers, and cream and stir to combine, mashing potatoes slightly. Season to taste with salt and transfer to serving bowl.\nTo serve, bring potato mixture, scallions, cotija, salsa, lime wedges, and hot tortillas to the table. Each taco should be made by stacking two tortillas, adding a small amount of the potato mixture, and topping as desired.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow To Make Tortillas\nMexican"
