Adjust the heat to maintain a simmer. Continue to cook, covered, until the chicken, potatoes, and shallots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.\nStir in the peanuts (if used). Remove the curry from heat and let it cool down a bit before serving with steamed jasmine rice.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMy Thai: Chicken Massaman Curry (Kaeng Matsaman Kai)\nChicken Mains\nThai\nDairy-free Mains\nStovetop Chicken\nChicken Drumsticks"
