Spoon into cups and serve.\nNotes\nI purchased a fine grain polenta. It wasn't labeled as \"instant\" but cooked very quickly in about 3 minutes. Cooking time (and liquid amount needed) may differ depending on the polenta that you use. If polenta thickens before it is cooked, add a small amount of milk until polenta is finished cooking.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nChocoholic: Creamy Chocolate Polenta\nCornmeal\nChocolate\nMilk\nDairy Milk\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings"
