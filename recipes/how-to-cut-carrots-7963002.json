  "full_text": "How to Cut Carrots\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nCarrots\n, as needed\nDirections\nTo Trim and Peel\nUsing a vegetable peeler (preferably Y-peeler, which we find works best), peel carrots all around.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a knife, trim off the top and bottom ends.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo Cut Rounds\nUsing a sharp knife, simply crosscut each carrot into rounds of whatever thickness is desired. This is a good option for salads and simple carrots side dishes (for side dishes, it's best to cut the rounds thicker so the carrots don't snap in half easily once cooked).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo Cut Sticks/Batons\nFor carrot sticks/batons, which are great for dips and crudit\u00e9s platters, cut the peeled carrot into roughly 3- or 4-inch lengthwise segments, then halve the carrots. The carrot halves can then be cut lengthwise into whatever size sticks you want. If using very large, thick carrots, instead of halving and then cutting into sticks, cut them into thick lengthwise planks first, then cut those planks lengthwise into sticks.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo Rough-Cut or Dice\nFor rough-cut carrots to be used in stocks and to flavor soups and stews, smaller carrots can simply be left whole and cut crosswise into large chunks. Large carrots should be split in half or quartered lengthwise first, then crosscut into large chunks.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor smaller dice, cut the carrot lengthwise into roughly 1/4-inch sticks, then crosscut those sticks into 1/4-inch dice.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo Cut Matchsticks/Julienne\nCarrot matchsticks, or julienne, can be cut by first dividing each peeled whole carrot into 3- to 5-inch lengths. Then cut off one thin slice of each carrot segment lengthwise; this will create a flat side that can then be used as a stable base for the subsequent cuts without the carrot rolling around on you.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWith the carrot sitting on its new flat side, cut it lengthwise into thin, even planks; the thinness of the planks will determine the thinness of your matchsticks.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCut each plank lengthwise into matchsticks of your desired thickness.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTo Cut Brunoise\nFollow the instructions above for creating matchsticks/julienne. Then line up a small pile of matchsticks and crosscut them to form a very tiny, uniform dice (brunoise).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nKnife Skills\nThe Latest\nHow-Tos",
