Stir well for 20 seconds and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Gently pour the port down the inside of the cocktail glass, allowing it to slide down the side and settle in the bottom of the drink. Twist a piece of orange or lemon peel over the drink, but don't drop it in, as that will ruin the visual effect.\nGin\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines"
