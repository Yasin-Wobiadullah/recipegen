Remove from heat and immediately stir in sugar, salt, and milk, followed by egg. Sift in flour and stir until smooth. Add yeast and baking soda last, stirring to combine. Cover and refrigerate overnight, between 12 and 18 hours. The batter should be gooey and spongy at this point.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Waffles:\nSet waffle iron to medium and preheat until the indicator is ready; if using cast iron, brush lightly with safflower, vegetable, or canola oil. For an 8-inch square machine, scrape in half of the batter per batch. For a 7-inch Belgian machine, scrape in about one-third. Close lid and griddle until golden brown but still steaming, 5 to 7 minutes depending on the depth and heat of your machine. (Cooked waffles can be held on a rack in a 200\u00b0F (90\u00b0C) oven while remaining batches are cooked.) Serve immediately with maple syrup, lemon chantilly, and/or strawberries.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nWaffle iron\n, 3-quart stainless steel saucepan or\nsaucier\n,\nflexible spatula\nNotes\nFrom size and depth to heat settings and materials (cast iron versus nonstick), waffle irons vary considerably from brand to brand; a small test waffle is a low-risk way to determine how the batter behaves on your machine.\nRead More\nButtermilk Vanilla Waffles\nBacon, Cheese, and Scallion Waffles\nFully Loaded Mexican Fried Chicken With Green Chili\u2013Corn Waffles\nGluten-Free Sweet Potato and Corn Waffles\nHerb Waffles with Sausage, Peppers, and a Fried Egg\nWaffles\nEaster\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
