Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Spread cornbread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger trays on oven racks and bake until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 15 minutes.\nWhile bread is cooling: In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, about 2 minutes, without allowing butter to brown. Add sausage and, using a stiff whisk or potato masher, break sausage into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no bigger than 1/4 inch). Cook, stirring frequently, until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. Add onion, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add 1 cup of chicken stock, salt, and freshly ground black pepper.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk remaining 2 cups chicken stock, eggs, and 3 tablespoons of parsley until homogenous. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture. Add cornbread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed. Transfer dressing to a buttered 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish or 10- by 14-inch oval dish.\nWhen ready to bake, adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Uncover dressing and bake until an instant-read thermometer reads 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) when inserted into center of dish and dressing is crisped on top, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool for 15 minutes, sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon of parsley, and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n2 rimmed baking sheets, whisk or potato masher, large baking or casserole dish, instant-read thermometer\nNotes\nTo learn why you should use your potato masher to break up ground meat in a skillet, check out our article\nhere\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dressing can be prepared through step 3, covered with aluminum foil, and refrigerated for up to 2 days.\nThe uncooked dressing can be wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 6 months. Proceed with step 4 of recipe when ready to cook.\nOnce cooled, the baked dressing can be wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 6 months. Reheat in a 350\u00baF (175\u00baC) oven until warmed through.\nCornbread\nThanksgiving Stuffings\nSausages\nSage\nThanksgiving Side Dishes",
