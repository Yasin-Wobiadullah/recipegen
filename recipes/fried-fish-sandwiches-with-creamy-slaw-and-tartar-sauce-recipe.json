Return it to the bowl with dry flour and quickly coat it on both sides, shake off any excess flour and carefully lower it into the hot oil. Repeat with remaining fish.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nCook, shaking the pan gently and agitating the oil with a wire mesh spider or tongs constantly, turning the fish until it is golden brown and crisp on all sides, about 8 minutes total.
