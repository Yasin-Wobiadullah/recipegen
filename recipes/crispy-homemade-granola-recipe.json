Toss with a flexible spatula to combine, then stir in buttermilk and melted butter. Cover with plastic or a kitchen towel and set aside until oats are stiff and dry, about 20 minutes (the chia will look a little fuzzy, but that's normal). Stir in sugar and salt, cover, and let stand until the mixture looks loose and damp from the dissolved sugar, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Mix-Ins:\nMeanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Combine pumpkin seeds, chopped almonds, and pecan pieces on a parchment-lined half sheet pan and toast until fragrant and just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, toss with oil, then sprinkle with salt; reserve the parchment-lined half sheet pan. Stir in dried apricots, dried cherries, and dried blueberries too.\nTo Bake the Granola:\nReduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). When the sugar has dissolved, scrape oats onto the parchment-lined half sheet pan and spread into an even layer. Bake until uniformly golden brown and dry to the touch, about 100 minutes, pausing every 25 minutes or so to take the mixture from the oven and stir well with a pair of forks.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen the oats are golden brown and dry to the touch, transfer to the bowl of fruit and nuts. Toss with a flexible spatula until well combined, then return to the baking sheet and spread in an even layer to cool, about 45 minutes. As soon as the granola has cooled, transfer to an airtight container and store up to 6 weeks at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFlexible spatula\n,\nhalf sheet pan\nNotes\nSmall packages of dried fruit can be wildly expensive; look to stores that sell in bulk or else shop online. These are my favorite brands of\ndried apricots\n,\ntart cherries\n, and\nblueberries\n(all at Amazon). When making substitutions, think about the flavors, textures, and colors you're replacing, and choose a fruit with a similar profile.\nRead More\nBanana Granola\nEleven Madison Park's Granola\nCoconut Matzo Granola\nGranola\nEaster\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
