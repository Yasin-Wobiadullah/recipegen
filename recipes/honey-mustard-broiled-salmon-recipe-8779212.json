Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, honey, and cayenne (if using). Season with salt and pepper; feel free to adjust flavor and heat level by adding more cayenne, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lightly season salmon all over with salt and pepper. Set salmon on prepared baking sheet and rub a thin, even layer of the honey-mustard mixture all over the surface and sides.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nBroil salmon until browned on top and the center registers 115 to 125\u00b0F (46 to 52\u00b0C) for medium-rare to medium, respectively, 5 to 15 minutes. (It can help to keep the oven door cracked while salmon is cooking to prevent the broiler from cycling on and off, though not all ovens function this way.) If salmon becomes well browned on top before it is cooked enough in the center, switch off the broiler and set the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C), then continue cooking until done, 1 to 2 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer salmon to plates or a platter and serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n, aluminum foil,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nYou can make this recipe with salmon that's already been portioned into individual servings, or a larger fillet for a party or large gathering (just keep in mind that once cooked, a large piece of salmon won't cut cleanly). This recipe works equally well with skin-on and skinned salmon.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nHoney-mustard mixture can be prepared up to 7 days ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nLeftover cooked salmon can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nSalmon\nThe Latest\nQuick Dinners"
