In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and milk or half and half until fully combined. Stir in half of cheese and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nHeat oil in a 10-inch oven-safe nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron or carbon steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add bacon and cook until light brown but not crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined plate and remove all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat from pan.\nAdd corn, scallions, and jalape\u00f1o to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nPour eggs into skillet and cook, stirring and scraping pan all over, until very loose curds form throughout, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook until eggs on bottom and edges are set, about 2 minutes. Top with remaining cheese, bacon, and a few jalape\u00f1o slices for decoration, if using.\nPlace under broiler and broil until top is just set and a pale golden brown, a few minutes. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nGruy\u00e8re is a nutty cheese that melts well, though cheddar or any good melting cheese would make a delicious substitute. To save time, you can use pre-grated cheese instead of cubed.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nDinner in 20: Simple, Satisfying Corn and Bacon Frittata\nRoasting\nGruyere\nOmelettes\nBacon\nCorn",
