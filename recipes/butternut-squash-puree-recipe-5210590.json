Lightly coat the squash all over with oil, season all over with 2 teaspoons salt, and roast until well browned and a fork can easily slide through the flesh without resistance, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.\nJillian Atkinson\nUsing a spoon, scoop out squash flesh; discard the skins. In a food processor or blender, combine the cream with about a third of the squash, then pur\u00e9e, stopping to scrape down sides as necessary, until smooth, about 1 minute. Add remaining squash along with the butter and continue to pur\u00e9e, scraping and tamping as necessary, until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with remaining salt, then serve warm.\nJillian Atkinson\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nor\nblender\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe squash pur\u00e9e can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
