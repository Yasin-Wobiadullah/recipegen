Twist off the tail and claws. Discard carapace or save for stock.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nLay tails flat against a cutting board and insert two stiff wooden or metal skewers along the length of the tails, keeping as close to the shell as possible.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPrepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of water or a steamer to a rolling boil. Add lobster tails and claws and cook for 1 minute. Remove tails with tongs and transfer to ice bath. Continue cooking claws for 4 minutes longer, then transfer to ice bath.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nShuck lobster tails by first squeezing sides of shell inward until they crack. Pull sides of shell outward. The shell should open up easily. Remove tail meat and set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTo remove claw meat, break off the small pincer, being careful to get the meat out of it. Using kitchen shears or the spine of a heavy knife, crack bottom of shell to create an opening large enough to extract the meat. Carefully remove claw meat by shaking shell up and down, or by using the back of a wooden skewer to slide it out.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTo remove knuckle meat, snip open shells with kitchen shears and use the back of a wooden skewer to remove meat.

Serve 1 1/2 to 2 lobster tails per person, depending on the size of the tails.
