Spread the chicken wings in a rimmed baking sheet and bake until deeply golden brown, about 40 minutes. Pour off any rendered chicken fat and reserve for cooking.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer the wings from the roasting pan to a stock pot. Add 1 cup of water to the roasting pan and scrape up any brown bits with a wooden spoon. Pour the water and brown bits to a stockpot. Add enough water to cover the wings and simmer for 3 1/2 hours, adding more water if needed to keep chicken wings submerged. (Alternatively, simmer the wings in a pressure cooker at full pressure for 1 1/2 hours.)\nAdd the onion, garlic, and bell pepper to the stock and simmer an additional 30 minutes. Strain the stock and reduce further or add more water until the yield is 5 cups.\nFor the stew:\nAdd the chicken fat to a 6-quart Dutch oven or similar heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pot and heat over medium-high until the fat shimmers. Season chicken thighs with salt and sear, skin side down, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip chicken and sear on other side until browned, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside. Drain any excess fat from pot and lower heat to medium.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd diced onion and minced garlic to pot and cook, scraping up any browned bits from the chicken, until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add aji panca or cayenne, cumin, paprika, oregano, and black pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nIncrease heat to high, then add chicken wing stock, diced potato, and raisins and bring to a simmer. Season with salt. Return chicken thighs to pot along with any accumulated juices. Reduce heat to low. Cover and gently simmer until chicken has cooked through, about 30 minutes.\nRemove the stew from heat and set aside until the chicken is cool enough to handle, about 1 hour (The chicken should be left to cool in the stew so that it doesn't dry out.) Using your hands, pick the meat from the chicken thighs and break into small pieces, discarding the skin and bones. Stir peas and picked chicken meat into the stew and refrigerate until the stew has solidified, about 4 hours, preferably overnight, and up to 3 days in advance.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the dough:\nIn a 2-quart saucepan, combine butter and annatto and melt to infuse the butter with color.\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Pour the melted butter into the flour mixture and, using your hands, mix until thoroughly combined and sandy. Add 3/4 cup (177mL) hot water to the flour mixture and mix until the dough comes together into a smooth ball.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDivide the dough into 9 equal portions (about 100 grams each). Fold each portion of dough onto itself until it becomes smooth and pat into a disk. Cover with plastic wrap.\nAssembly:\nWork with one portion of dough at a time, keeping the remaining pieces covered. Lightly dust your work surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out one portion of dough into an 8-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. Loosen the dough from the work surface with an offset spatula.\nAdd 1/9 (about 1 generous cup) of the chilled chicken stew to the center of the dough. Top it with a quarter of a hardboiled egg and two black olive halves. Brush the edges of the dough with egg white. Join the edges of the dough together over the filling. Press the edges together to encase the filling into a large football with a seam running across the top. Crimp the edges and transfer the salte\u00f1a to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Freeze the formed salte\u00f1as before baking at least 1 hour and up to 3 months in advance. (If freezing long-term, once the salte\u00f1as are fully frozen, wrap each in plastic and transfer to a zip lock freezer bag to prevent freezer burn.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBaking:\nIf the salte\u00f1as have been frozen for only 1 hour, preheat your oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). If the salte\u00f1as have been frozen solid for 4 hours or more, preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment and spray lightly with cooking spray. Line the tray with the frozen salte\u00f1as. (Do not bake on the chilled baking sheet the salte\u00f1as were frozen on or the bottom of the pastry will not brown.) Brush the pastries with egg white and bake until the seam is blackened and the crust is golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n;\nstockpot\nor\npressure cooker\n;\nDutch oven\n;\nrolling pin\n; pastry brush\nNotes\nAji panca is a mild chile native to Peru with flavors of raisin and smoke along with a gentle heat.
