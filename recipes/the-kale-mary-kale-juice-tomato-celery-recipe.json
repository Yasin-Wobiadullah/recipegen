Add tomato juice and stir well until horseradish is well distributed. Add kale juice, celery juice, lemon juice, and hot sauce. Stir well. Serve with celery rib garnish, over ice if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nJuicer\nNotes\nGrape or cherry tomatoes generally have better flavor than out-of-season regular tomatoes. If you have ripe in-season tomatoes, you can substitute them for the grape or cherry tomatoes.\nThis recipe yields about 1 cup of juice, enough for two 1/2-cup servings. Juice is best served immediately and will lost flavor and color with time. Store leftover juice in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. In our testing, it took about 1 1/2 pounds of kale to produce 1 cup of juice. Results may vary based on kale and on juicer.\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nCelery\nKale\nTomato"
