Cook, flipping and moving the chiles often with a pair of tongs, until blackened on all sides. If you don't have a gas stove, turn on broiler to high. Place chiles on a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil, and place underneath the broiler. Cook, flipping occasionally with a pair of tongs, until blacked on all sides.\nWhen chiles are blackened, transfer to a plastic bag and seal. Let them steam for at least 5 minutes. When done, peel off the blackened skins. Cut a slit down the side of each, starting under the stem and continuing down to the tip. Carefully remove the seeds, being careful not to tear the chile.\nUsing a sharp knife, cut the kernels off the corn cobs. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. When shimmering, add the onion and garlic. Cook until onion is translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the corn, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until corn turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn off heat and set aside.\nCarefully stuff each chile with a layer of 1/2 cup of the sauteed corn mixture, 1/4 cup of the shredded cheese, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the crema. Finally, add 1 1/2 tablespoons of cheese on top of each slit. When stuffed, place each chile slit side up on a baking dish.\nTransfer baking dish to the upper middle rack in the oven and cook for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler to high, and cook until the cheese is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.\nPoblano Peppers\nMexican\nRoasted Vegetables\nCheese\nCorn",
