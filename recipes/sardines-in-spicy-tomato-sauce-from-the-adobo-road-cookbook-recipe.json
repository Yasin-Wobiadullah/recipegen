Add the shallot, garlic, dried red pepper flakes, and paprika and cook until the shallot becomes soft and translucent, 3-5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine, continuing to cook until the tomato paste just begins to brown, 1 minute more.\nToss the cherry tomatoes into the pan and saut\u00e9 until the tomatoes soften and have released some of their juices, 5-7 minutes.\nPour the wine into the pan, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the water and fish sauce and simmer until the liquid reduces and thickens a bit, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and set aside.\nSeason the sardines, inside and out, with the salt and black pepper. In a large bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil with the calamansi (or lemon) juice. Using your hands, toss the sardines in the olive oil and citrus mixture, making sure the mixture dresses the fish inside and out.\nPlace an oven rack in the closest position to the broiler and turn the broiler on high heat.\nRemove the sardines from the bowl and arrange them in a single layer on top of the tomato sauce in the saut\u00e9 pan. Place the pan underneath the broiler and broil for 10-12 minutes, flipping the fish over once. The sardines are ready when the skin is nicely browned and crisped, and the thickest part of the fish easily flakes from the tip of a knife.\nServe with steamed white rice and calamansi limes, or lemon wedges, on the side for squeezing over the fish\nFilipino\nSardines\nTomato\nSeafood Mains"
