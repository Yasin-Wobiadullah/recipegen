Fill a large, deep\ncast iron skillet\nwith 1/2 inch oil. Heat over medium-high to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Working in batches, add tortilla wedges and fry, flipping halfway through, until puffed and lightly golden, 1-2 minutes. Transfer chips to prepared baking sheet. Season with salt right away; then transfer to large bowl. Repeat for remaining chips.\nDrain off all but 1 tablespoon of oil (extra oil can be strained and saved for later use). Return skillet to medium-high heat and add onion. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer onions to another large bowl and set aside.\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Using a sharp knife, slice frozen steak as thinly as possible. Season steak with salt and pepper.\nAdd another tablespoon of oil to pan and set over high heat until smoking. Working in batches to prevent crowding, add steak and cook, turning occasionally, until browned all over, about 4 minutes per batch. Remove from heat and toss in bowl with onions. Repeat with remaining steak.\nLayer chips and steak mixture on a 9-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet or baking dish. Top with provolone cheese. Bake until provolone is fully melted, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in large bowl, toss together cheddar cheese and cornstarch. Heat evaporated milk in medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cheddar, a bit at a time, until fully melted and incorporated. Reduce heat to low and stir in vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Continue to cook, whisking constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes.\nPour cheese sauce over nachos; top with sliced hot cherry peppers and green onion. Serve warm.\nSpecial equipment\n12-inch cast iron skillet\nNotes\nHomemade tortilla chips are best, but you can skip the frying step by using good-quality store-bought tortilla chips instead. And if you insist on jarred Cheese Whiz, feel free to use it here in place of the homemade cheese sauce.\nNachos\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nGame Day",
