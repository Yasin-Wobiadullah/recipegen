This should make about a cup, but a little more or less is fine.\nBy the time the walnut mixture is smooth, the flour mixture should be bubbly. Add the rest of the bread flour and the salt to the flour mixture, and knead with the dough hook until it begins to come together.\nAdd the walnut mixture to the dough, including all the liquid that may be separating from the walnuts. Knead until the mixture has incorporated fully into the dough and it starts becoming smooth.\nStop the mixer and let the dough rest for 10-15 minutes before continuing.\nAfter the rest, continue kneading with the dough hook until the dough is smooth, shiny and elastic.\nRemove the bowl from the mixer, form the dough into a ball. It shouldn't be sticky at all at this point. Put the dough ball back into he mixer bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it rest until doubled in size, about an hour and a half.\nSprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.\nTake the dough out of the bowl, knead it briefly, and form into a tight ball. Place it, seam-side down, on the baking sheet. Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap and set it aside to rise until doubled, about 30 to 45 minutes.\nWhen the dough has doubled, slash the top. Be decorative if you want, or just slash an \"X\" in the top or make parallel lines or a square - whatever you prefer. To recreate the slashes I made, first make the large X in the top of the bread going almost to the base of the dough, then make short slashes in-between the long ones. Use small, sharp scissors to make tiny snips around the short slashes.\nBake for 40 to 45 minutes. If it seems to be browning too fast, turn the oven temperature down to 325\u00b0F.\nYeast Breads\nVegan\nApricot\nWalnuts"
