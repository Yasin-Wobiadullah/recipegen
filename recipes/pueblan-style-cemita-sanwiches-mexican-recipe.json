Return to milk, then dredge in bread crumbs, pressing to adhere. Place breaded cutlets on a baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nHeat about 1/2 inch oil in a cast-iron skillet to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Working in batches and adding oil as needed to maintain level, fry cutlets, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a clean paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper when still hot.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpread avocado on bottom bun halves. Top with fried cutlets. Mound half of the cheese on the cutlets.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nArrange onion rings on top of cheese. If using chipotles, tear into pieces and arrange on onion rings; alternatively, arrange pickled jalape\u00f1os on top of onion rings. Top with papalo and mound the remaining cheese on top. Drizzle with olive oil.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nScoop some bread from each of the top buns and discard. Close sandwiches and serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\n1 large\ncast iron skillet\n;\n2 baking sheets\nNotes\nCemita buns, papalo, and queso Oaxaca can be found at well-stocked Mexican and Latin American bakeries and grocers. Queso Oaxaca should be shredded by hand into very thin strands, just like string cheese. If you cannot find papalo, cilantro is an ok substitute.\nRead More\nRoosevelt Avenue-Style Cemita Sandwiches\nTacos de Canasta (Basket Tacos for a Party or Potluck)\nSpicy, Seared, Smothered, Stacked: An Introduction to Mexican Sandwiches\nNorth American Cuisines\nChicken Cutlets\nCinco de Mayo\nMexican Cuisine"
