Cook until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and let dry for a few minutes before adding the butter and mashing until almost smooth. Add scallions and mix, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow to cool to room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nTurn dough out onto a floured surface. Divide dough in half and roll it out into a wide, thin rectangle, less than 1/4-inch thick. Using half the filling, form a log of filling along the bottom long edge of the dough, roll the dough up, and then cut into four equal portions. Seal and pinch dough around filling on one end of each portion, and set on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Press each portion down a little to flatten slightly. Repeat process with remaining dough and filling to form a total of 8 knishes, then brush all portions with beaten egg. Bake until golden, about 45 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nBaking sheet\nHors D'Oeuvres\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nBaking\nRusset Potatoes",
