Add chillies, onions, ginger, and curry leaves and cook, stirring, until onions are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add turmeric and pepper and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add coconut milk and chopped tomato and bring to a gentle boil. Add grated coconut. Add the clams and the strained stock. Add vinegar or lime juice. Simmer for 1 minute and season with salt to taste.
