While water is heating, carve an \"X\" into rounded side of each chestnut with a serrated knife. Cut through shell only, being careful not to cut too deep into the nut itself.\nSerious Eats / Marvin Gapultos\nWhen water reaches a boil, quickly blanch slit chestnuts for 30 seconds. Drain and dry chestnuts, then transfer them, \"X\" side up, to heated skillet in oven. Roast chestnuts for 25-30 minutes, just until shell starts to curl away from nut.\nTransfer nuts to a large cutting board and cover loosely with a kitchen towel. Set aside just until nuts are cool enough to handle\u2014nuts will be easier to peel while they are still warm.\nPlace skillet on stovetop and add butter, cinnamon stick, salt, sugar, and nutmeg. The skillet should still be hot enough to melt butter. Stir everything until butter is completely melted, then transfer butter mixture to a small bowl.\nUsing your fingers, peel away shells and brown skins of chestnuts. If any brown skin clings to the nuts, a paring knife can be used to peel them away. You can choose to toss peeled chestnuts in melted butter, or serve butter on the side. Serve chestnuts while still warm.\nSpecial Equipment\nSerrated bread knife,\ncast iron pan\nHors D'Oeuvres\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nRoasting\nChestnut\nChristmas Appetizers",
