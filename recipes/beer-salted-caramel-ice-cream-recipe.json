  "full_text": "Beer Caramel Ice Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n5 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nChurning/Freezing Time\n14 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n14 hrs 40 mins\nServes\n8\nto 10 servings\nMakes\n1 quart\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2\ncups\nsugar\n2\ntablespoons\nwater\n4\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n, cut into small chunks\n2\ncups\nheavy cream\n1\ncup\nwhole milk\n6\negg yolks\n8\nounces\npale ale\n1\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\n, to taste\nDirections\nIn a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat sugar, moistened with two tablespoons of water, on high. Let sugar melt, bubble, and caramelize undisturbed until it reaches a rich, dark amber, rotating the pan to avoid hot spots. Let sugar smoke for 3 seconds, then quickly stir in butter and turn heat to low.\nWhen butter is fully incorporated, slowly stir in cream and milk. Sugar will steam and bubble. If sugar seizes, stir on low heat and it will dissolve completely into dairy.\nIn a large bowl, whisk egg yolks until very well combined. Add about 2/3 cup dairy mixture to yolks one ladle at a time, whisking constantly, then whisk yolk mixture back into saucepan. Cook on low heat, stirring frequently, until custard thickens to coat the back of a spoon and a swiped finger leaves a clean line.\nRemove from heat and stir in beer, then add salt in small increments to taste. Custard is well-salted when it has a distinctly sharp flavor, not just burnt sweetness. Strain into a container and chill overnight. The next day, churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Return ice cream to freezer for at least 2 hours so it can firm up.\nSpecial equipment\nice cream machine\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSerious Entertaining: A Beer-Infused Dinner Menu\nThe Real Rules of Making Boozy Ice Cream\nIce Cream",
