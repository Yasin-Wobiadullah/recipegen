Set over steaming water, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg whites hold steady at 175\u00b0F (79\u00b0C), between 8 and 10 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nTransfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed until meringue is glossy and beginning to ball up inside the whisk, about 5 minutes. Use immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot\n;\ndigital thermometer\n;\nstand mixer\nNotes\nYou can toast the sugar for this meringue in just 30 minutes with\nmy \"quick\" technique\nor use sugar\nas a pie weight\nto toast it passively. In that case, after transferring the sugar to a new container, check to make sure it's grease-free by running a finger across the interior of the foil lining. If it feels greasy, it means the sugar was exposed to the dough and able to wick away some of the butter. While\ntrace amounts of fat\nwon't prevent Swiss meringue from foaming, they will adversely impact its overall volume and stability.\nRead More\nDouble-Chocolate Cream Pie Recipe\nToasted Sugar Recipe\nDesserts\nEgg Whites\nEaster Desserts\nChristmas Desserts"
