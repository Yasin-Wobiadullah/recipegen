Line standard muffin tin with cupcake liners (see note). In medium bowl, whisk flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt to combine; set aside. In large bowl, whisk sugar, brown sugar, buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla to combine.\nWhisk dry ingredients into wet ingredients until batter is smooth. Fill cupcake cups 3/4 full and bake until firm to the touch and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 19 minutes. Let cupcakes cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely before frosting.\nFor the Green Ganache\n: Heat white chocolate and cream in medium bowl in microwave or over pan of barely simmering water, stirring, until mixture is melted and smooth. Chill until firm enough to frost, about 30 minutes, Stir in green coloring to desired shade.\nFor the Chili Ganache\n: Heat bittersweet chocolate, cream, and chile flakes (if using), stirring, until mixture is melted and smooth. Adjust to taste with more chili if desired. Chill until firm enough to scoop, about 1 hour. Fill pastry bag fitted with large plain tip with ganache and pipe 12 round balls (1 per cupcake; see note). Chill until just firm enough to handle, about 30 minutes.\nAssemble Cupcakes:\nFrost cupcakes with green ganache. Roll chile ganache balls in sprinkles and place on cupcakes. Cut legs out of licorice sticks and stick into spider. Secure the eyes with dabs of extra chocolate ganache. Stick almond fangs into mouth. Serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nMuffin pan\n,\npastry bag fitted with plain tip\nNotes\nSift cocoa if lumpy.\nThis batter makes a tad more than might fit in a standard cupcake cup. Use big liners, or fill normal sized cupcake cups to 3/4 full and bake extra cupcakes if desired.\nA scoop or a pair of spoons can be used to portion the chile ganache instead of a pastry bag. Don't chill ganache balls too firm or you'll have trouble sticking in the legs.\nCupcakes\nChocolate\nHalloween",
