  "full_text": "Sorry, You Can't Just Throw Any Fruit in Sangria\u2014Here's What Actually Works\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nMaceration Time\n2 hrs\nTotal\n2 hrs 10 mins\nServes\n4\nto 8\nMakes\n1 liter\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\n(\n750 ml) bottle\nlight or medium\ndry red wine\n, such as Rioja\n1/2 to 1\ncup\nbrandy\nor rum (\n118-237\nml\n), see note\n1/4\ncup\n(\n60\nml\n)\nfreshly squeezed juice\nfrom\n1\norange\n, plus\n2\nwide\nstrips\norange zest\n2\ntablespoons\n(\n30\nml\n)\nfreshly squeezed juice\nfrom\n1\nlemon\n, plus\n3\nwide\nstrips\nlemon zest\n1\nmedium\nnavel orange\n(\n7 ounces\n;\n198 g\n), cut into roughly 1-inch pieces, seeds removed\n1\nlarge\napple\n(\n10 ounces\n;\n283 g\n), cored and cut into roughly 3/4-inch dice\n1 (\n12-ounce\n;\n340 ml\n) can club soda or\nseltzer water\n, well chilled\n1/4\ncup\n(\n60\nml\n)\nsimple syrup\n, plus more to taste (see note)\nIce\n, for serving (optional)\nOrange wedges\n, for garnish\nDirections\nIn a large pitcher, combine wine with brandy (or rum). Stir in orange and lemon juices.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd diced orange and apple to pitcher. Twist orange and lemon zests to express oils into pitcher, then add zests to pitcher. Stir to combine, then refrigerate until fully chilled, at least 2 and up to 8 hours (we prefer a roughly 4-hour maceration time; see make-ahead section below).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nGently stir club soda into pitcher.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nStir in simple syrup, adding more to taste, 1 tablespoon at a time, if desired. If you only added a portion of the brandy (or rum) earlier, you can stir more in now to taste, if desired, then continue to adjust with simple syrup until desired final flavor is reached.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFill glasses with ice, if desired. Ladle chilled sangria into glasses, garnish with orange wedges, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nIn our tastings, we preferred the full 1 cup of brandy or rum per 750ml bottle of wine, but if you're unsure, you can start with the lesser 1/2-cup amount, and then mix in more to taste at the end if desired.\nTo make simple syrup, stir or shake 1/2 cup cold water with 1/2 cup granulated sugar until sugar is fully dissolved. Keep refrigerated until ready to use.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe wine, brandy, and fruit can be left to macerate for up to 8 hours before finishing and serving, though the fruit can over-soften and the sangria can develop bitter flavors if left too long. We found a 4-hour maceration time to strike a good balance between achieving a good infusion of flavor and maintaining bright and fresh flavors and textures.\nSummer Drinks\nRecipes\nSummer\nDrinks"
