Scrape down the sides with a spatula as needed. Turn down the speed on the mixer to low and add the cocoa and chiles, followed by the flour. Increase the speed when the dough looks crumbly and add the egg. Scrape down the sides again and mix till thoroughly combined.\nHeavily dust a work surface with flour, then turn the dough out. Divide it into two even pieces and roll them into 1-inch diameter logs. You'll need to add flour from your work surface to keep the soft dough from sticking. Wrap each log in plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for one hour, or until stiff but not frozen solid. You can keep the cookies frozen this way for several months, slicing off and baking as needed. For long-term storage, wrap the dough in additional plastic and some aluminum foil.\n15 minutes before you plan to bake them, turn your oven to 350\u00b0F and grease two half sheet pans. With a very sharp knife, slice the cookies into 1/8th-inch thin rounds and lay them on the sheet pans, leaving a 1/2-inch space between cookies. Chill in the refrigerator for two minutes before transferring to the oven. Bake 7-8 minutes for chewy cookies, or 11-12 minutes for crispy ones. Transfer to cooling rack and cool completely.\nPut an inch of water in a saucepan and bring it to a bowl with a large glass or ceramic bowl on top. When the water boils, reduce to a simmer and add the chocolate to bowl. Whisk constantly until chocolate is melted, making sure that it stays below 91\u00b0F (if it goes above that,\nhere's\ninstructions on how to re-temper chocolate).\nLine your two half sheet pans with parchment and drop cookies into chocolate 4 to 5 at a time. Stir with a fork until evenly coated, then remove them and slide them off your fork with another fork onto the parchment. Scrape down the sides of your bowl with a spatula to use all the chocolate.\nSprinkle cookies with extra ground chile and coarse salt while they're cooling, then set aside to cool completely. Store in a large, airtight container in a cool, dry place.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Pairing Chilies and Chocolate\nCookies\nChocolate\nChile Pepper",
