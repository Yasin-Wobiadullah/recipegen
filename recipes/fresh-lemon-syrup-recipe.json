Cover tightly and let stand at room temperature, stirring once every 45 minutes or so, until sugar has completely dissolved, about 3 hours (or up to 12 if timing is an issue).\nSerious Eats / Vicki Wasik\nUsing a cheesecloth-lined or fine-mesh stainless steel strainer set over a nonreactive bowl, strain syrup. Working in batches, transfer rinds to a stainless steel potato ricer and squeeze to release any extra syrup, allowing it to pass through strainer into bowl; discard rinds. Refrigerate syrup for up to 3 months in a glass bottle or pint jar.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nPotato ricer or cheesecloth\nNotes\nThis recipe takes advantage of the pithy rinds left over from juicing lemons for other projects, so it's all right if some or all of the lemons have been zested. When starting from whole lemons, simply zest (if you like) and juice beforehand.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nRefrigerate syrup for up to three months in a glass bottle or pint jar.\nRead More\nCrispy Citrus-Candied Pistachios\nLemon Chantilly (Whipped Cream)\nLemon\nVegan\nCocktails",
