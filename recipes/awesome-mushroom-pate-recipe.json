  "full_text": "Awesome Mushroom P\u00e2t\u00e9 Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nTotal\n25 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/2\ntablespoons\nfinely ground dried mushrooms\n(a mini food processor should be able to grind a big handful of dried mushrooms)\n13\nounces\nmixed mushrooms\n, caps quartered, stems roughly chopped (unless they're inedible)\n3\ntablespoons\nolive oil\n4\ncloves\ngarlic\n, left whole and in their paper jackets\nAbout\n8\nwhole stems\nthyme\nKosher salt\nFreshly cracked\nblack pepper\n3\nounces\nNeufch\u00e2tel cheese\n1\ntablespoon\nflat leaf parsley\n, packed\n2\nteaspoons\nlemon juice\nTruffle oil\n, for drizzling\nBaguette\n, thinly sliced, for serving\nDirections\nPreheat the broiler. Put a wide ovensafe braising pot on the stove over medium-high heat.\nAdd the olive oil to the hot pot, followed immediately by the mushrooms, dried mushrooms, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Toss everything together with tongs so the mushrooms are well coated with the hot olive oil. Put the mushrooms about 5 to 6 inches from the broiler and cook for 15 minutes, tossing once. The residual heat from preheating the pot will help brown the mushrooms. Scrape everything out of the mushroom pot into a bowl to cool.\nWhen the mushrooms are room temperature, set aside 1/4 cup for garnish. Squeeze the garlic from their jackets and put them and rest of the mushrooms in the food processor with the Neufchatel, parsley, and lemon juice. Whiz until smooth. Taste, and adjust the seasoning. Transfer to a pretty bowl, then drizzle with truffle oil, top with the reserved mushrooms, and serve with thinly sliced baguette.\nMushrooms",
