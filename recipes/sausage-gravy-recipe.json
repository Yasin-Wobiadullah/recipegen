Cook sausage, breaking apart with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a plate, leaving drippings in pan.

Slowly whisk in milk and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nStir in sausage, sage (if using), and crushed red pepper (if using).
