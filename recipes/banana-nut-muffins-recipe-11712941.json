Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper or silicone liners.\nFor the Walnut Streusel:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk flour, walnuts, brown sugar, and cinnamon together, breaking up any sugar clumps by hand, if needed. Stir in butter until well combined. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nFor the Muffins\n: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg to combine. Set aside. In another medium bowl, whisk together mashed bananas and sour cream. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat brown sugar, butter, oil, and salt on medium speed until fluffy, stopping to scrape down sides as needed, about 1 minute. Beat in egg and vanilla until combined, about 10 seconds. (Recipe can also be prepared in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer.)\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nWith mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture, alternating with banana mixture in two additions, and beat until nearly combined, about 2 to 3 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold in walnuts until just combined. (Do not overmix.)\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nEvenly divide batter between prepared muffin cups (about 1/4 cup per cup). Top each muffin with about 1 1/2 teaspoons Walnut Streusel).\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nBake 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00baC), and bake until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let stand in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully remove from pan; serve warm or at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nSpecial Equipment\n12-cup muffin pan\n, muffin liners,\nstand mixer\nor\nhand mixer\n, toothpick or cake tester, wire rack\nNotes\nIf you don\u2019t feel like making a streusel topping, you can top each muffin with 1/2 teaspoon of Demerara sugar and 1 teaspoon chopped walnuts. Lightly press walnuts into batter, then bake as directed.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe streusel can be made up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container until ready to use.\nOnce cooled, muffins can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days or refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. If refrigerating, let muffins come back to room temperature before serving. Muffins can be gently reheated in a microwave or 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) oven before serving.\nMuffins can be frozen for up to 1 month. To freeze muffins, arrange them in a single layer on a 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Once frozen, transfer to a zip-top bag.
