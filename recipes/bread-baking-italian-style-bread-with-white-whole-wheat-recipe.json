Add the bread flour and knead with the dough hook until the dough is smooth and elastic.\nAdd the butter and salt and continue kneading until both are fully incorporated. Form the loaf into a ball, drizzle with a bit of olive oil, and return it to the bowl. Cover the bowl and set aside until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. When the dough has doubled, remove it from the bowl and gently form it into a log about 10 inches long. Place it on the prepared pan, seam-side down. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until doubled, about 30 minutes.\nMake 3 diagonal slashes on top of the loaf and bake at 350 degrees until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let the loaf cool completely on a rack before slicing.\nYeast Breads\nItalian"
