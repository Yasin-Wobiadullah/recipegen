Add shiitake, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their water and are starting to brown all over, about 4 minutes. Transfer shiitake to a plate and keep warm.\nAdd remaining 2 tablespoons oil to saucepan, then add onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook, stirring up any brown bits on bottom of saucepan, until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.\nAdd stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in kimchi and its liquid, miso, and soy sauce and return to a simmer. Season with salt, if needed.\nMeanwhile, if using angel-hair pasta, add baking soda to 4 quarts of boiling salted water; otherwise, omit baking soda and bring 4 quarts of plain salted water to a boil. Cook noodles until al dente; drain completely.\nTransfer noodles to bowl and spoon kimchi broth on top. Top each bowl with 2 egg halves, reserved shiitakes, scallions, nori, and watercress. Serve right away.\nNotes\nIdeally the stock should gel at least slightly when chilled. You can use homemade chicken stock that was made with lots of wings and/or feet, which should help it gel naturally, or you can use thinner homemade stock or store-bought low-sodium broth with 2 packets unflavored gelatin dissolved into it. To do so, sprinkle gelatin on top of cold or room-temperature stock and allow gelatin to soften while you prepare the other ingredients, then add it with the stock when called for in the recipe.\nJapanese\nKorean\nStovetop Noodles\nRamen\nShiitake Mushroom",
