Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Eggplant:\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Set a strainer in a large heatproof mixing bowl, and set bowl on a heatproof surface. In a wok, heat oil over high heat to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C). In a separate large mixing bowl, combine eggplant, cornstarch, vinegar, water, and salt. Mix thoroughly with your hands until well-coated. Carefully add half of the eggplant to the wok and fry, stirring constantly, until just cooked through, about 30 seconds. Using a spider skimmer, transfer eggplant to prepared baking sheet. Return oil to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C), and repeat frying process with remaining eggplant. Once all of the eggplant has been fried, carefully pour all of the hot frying oil through strainer into large mixing bowl; set aside to cool and discard or reserve for another use. Wipe out wok and return to stovetop.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Stir-Fry:\nReturn wok to high heat until smoking. Add 2 tablespoons (30ml) of the reserved eggplant frying oil and swirl the wok to evenly coat the bottom and sides with oil. Add pork, and spread into an even layer using the bottom of the wok spatula. Cook, undisturbed, until pork is lightly browned on bottom side, about 20 seconds. Flip pork and break it up into small pieces with the spatula using a chopping motion while stirring constantly. Add the garlic and chile and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer the pork mixture to a small bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReturn wok to high heat and add the stir-fry sauce. Bring to a rapid simmer, then add pork mixture and eggplant. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is fully absorbed by eggplant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat, add basil, and stir until well-combined and basil is slightly wilted. Serve immediately with cooked jasmine rice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nCarbon steel wok, wok spatula.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStored in an airtight container, the sauce will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator.\nThai\nPork\nEggplant\nPork Stir-Fry\nMains",
