We recommend using aquafaba from canned chickpeas for reliable and consistent results. Please note that while home-cooked chickpeas can produce aquafaba that works, you may end up with varying results depending on how much water was used to cook the beans and how they were cooked. One 15-ounce can of chickpeas gives about 2/3 cup (160g) aquafaba.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis frosting can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\nVegan Desserts\nDesserts\nChickpeas\nThe Latest"
