Pour boiling water over the hyssop leaves in a small bowl and steep for 3 minutes. Strain through fine mesh strainer into 1-cup liquid measure and add cold water to get back to 6 tablespoons total (1/4 cup plus two tablespoons). Set aside to cool.\nBeat together egg yolks and sugar in stand mixer or by hand in medium bowl until light and pale yellow and mixture falls in ribbons from whisk. Add cooled hyssop water and stir to combine. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir until just combined\u2014do not overmix.\nIn clean bowl with new whisk (carefully clean stand mixer and whisk attachment if using) beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. The whites should be dry but still have a shine to them.\nStir about a 1/4 of beaten whites into yolk mixture to lighten it, then add remaining whites in 3 or 4 additions, folding gently with rubber spatula. Line the bottom of loaf pan with parchment paper and pour the batter in. It should come to just below the lip (excess batter can be baked in separate small ramekin). Bake until top feels firm and springy when pressed with a finger, about 30 minutes.\nSlide knife around edges of the pan and remove cake onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool 10 minutes, then slice into thirds. Let slices cool completely, then spread rose jam evenly on one layer. Add the middle layer. Whip the heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks, then spread it on the middle layer and cover it with the top. Trim sides to form neat rectangle if desired. Serve immediately or chill overnight covered in plastic wrap to enhance hyssop flavor.\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 5-inch loaf pan or two 9-inch round cake pans\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Hyssop\nCakes\nLayer Cake",
