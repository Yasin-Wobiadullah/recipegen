Line a 9- by 13-inch anodized aluminum cake pan with parchment, then grease lightly with pan spray.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine brown sugar, molasses, ginger, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cloves, five-spice powder, black pepper, and eggs. Mix on low until moistened, then increase to high and whip until foamy and thick, about 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReduce speed to low and drizzle in melted butter, then add all-purpose and whole wheat flours, followed by buttermilk. Once combined, shut off mixer and fold batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then scrape into prepared pan.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake until cake is puffed and firm (though crust will retain a light impression when pressed with a fingertip), about 32 minutes. Cool in pan until firm, then slice into squares with a knife. If desired, top with swirls of cream cheese frosting or whipped Greek yogurt.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nflexible spatula\n,\n9- by 13-inch anodized aluminum cake pan\nNotes\nIf you don't have whole wheat flour on hand, feel free to use an equal amount of all-purpose flour instead; the cake won't be quite as flavorful and tender, but it'll be close enough in a pinch.\nRead More\nFast and Easy Cream Cheese Frosting\nClassic Chocolate Yule Log\nTexas Sheet Cake\nGingerbread Ice Cream\nCakes\nSheet Cake\nGinger\nThanksgiving Desserts\nChristmas Desserts"
