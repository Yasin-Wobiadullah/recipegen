Place bacon in oven as it preheats and bake until crisp, about 20 minutes. (Check frequently, as different ovens will preheat at different rates.)\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, thoroughly mix refried beans with 1/4 cup of Buffalo hot sauce. Spread refried beans in an even layer in an 8- by 8-inch baking dish or round casserole dish.\nIn a separate mixing bowl, mix cream cheese with ranch dressing and dry ranch seasoning. Gently spread cream cheese mixture over bean layer in baking dish, being careful not to blend the two together.\nMix chicken with remaining 1/2 cup Buffalo hot sauce. Spread chicken all over cream cheese layer.\nSprinkle pepper jack cheese evenly over chicken.\nOnce bacon has finished cooking, transfer it to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to absorb any excess grease. Bake dip until it is warmed through and cheese on top has melted, about 8 minutes.\nWhile dip is still hot, top with blue cheese crumbles.\nCrumble bacon and sprinkle all over.\nTop with scallions and serve with chips and celery. The dip can be served hot, warm, or at room temperature. It can be assembled in advance (leaving blue cheese, bacon, and scallions off until the very end) and reheated in the oven before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n, aluminum foil, 8- by 8-inch\nbaking dish\nor round casserole dish (preferably glass, for best visibility of layers)\nNotes\nFor the chicken layer, the easiest option is to use the white meat from a rotisserie chicken, but you can also poach chicken breasts until they're cooked through.\nRead More\nBuffalo Chicken Salad Recipe\nBuffalo Chicken Grilled Cheese Sandwich Recipe\nAir-Fryer Buffalo Wings Recipe\nCaesar Dip Recipe\nGooey Cheeseburger Dip Recipe\nDips\nChicken\nChicken Breast"
