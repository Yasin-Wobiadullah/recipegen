  "full_text": "Bloody Mary Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nounces\nvodka\n(or really, try gin, or even a blanco tequila)\n1/4\nounce\nfresh lemon juice\nDashes\nof\nsalt and black pepper\n1/4\nteaspoon\nhorseradish\n2\ndashes\ntabasco sauce\n3\ndashes\nworcestershire sauce\n4\nounces\ntomato juice\nDirections\nCombine ingredients in a mixing glass and fill with ice. Gently roll from one glass to another until chilled (if you shake a Bloody Mary, the tomato juice will foam, and if you simply build it over ice in a glass, the ice will melt faster and the drink will become insipid before you have a chance to finish it). Strain into a Collins glass filled with fresh ice. Garnish with a slice of lemon or lime or\u2014who am I kidding?\u2014pretty much anything short of the Hoover Dam.\nVodka",
