Mix together and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nFor the Salad\n: Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Prepare an ice bath. Blanch peas in water, boiling until bright green and just tender, about 1 minute. Transfer to ice bath with a wire mesh strainer. Add snap peas to blanching water and cook until bright green and just tender, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to ice bath with a wire mesh strainer. Add asparagus tips (not the stalks) to blanching water and cook until bright green and just tender, about 1 minute. Transfer to ice bath with a wire mesh strainer. Remove all vegetables from ice bath and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to dry. Set vegetables aside.\nFor the Asparagus Sauce\n: Transfer asparagus stalks to blanching water and cook until completely tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer hot stalks to the jar of a blender. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Start blender at slow speed and gradually increase to high. Blend until asparagus pur\u00e9e is completely smooth, adding a tablespoon or two of blanching water and scraping down sides as necessary. Season pur\u00e9e to taste with salt and pepper and more olive oil if desired, then set aside to cool slightly. Discard blanching water.\nFor the Eggs:\nIn a large saucepan, bring 3 inches of water to a simmer over high heat. Add vinegar and season with salt. Reduce heat until water is just barely quivering. Break one egg into a small bowl. Swirl water in pot with a wooden spoon, then carefully lower egg into the water. Repeat until all four eggs are in the water. Cook, gently swirling the water and turning the eggs occasionally, until whites are set but yolks are still liquid, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove eggs and transfer to a bowl filled with warm tap water. Set aside.\nFor the Ramps:\nHeat canola or vegetable oil in a large heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until smoking. Add ramps and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring and tossing occasionally until browned and lightly crisped. Season to taste with salt and pepper and transfer ramps to a plate lined with a paper towel.\nTo Assemble the Salad:\nSpread asparagus pur\u00e9e along the bottoms of four wide, shallow bowls or plates. Toss the peas, snow peas, snow pea greens, and asparagus tips with 3/4 of the dressing in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide salad evenly amongst the four bowls. Top each salad with saut\u00e9ed ramps and a poached egg. Spoon remaining dressing over the egg and season the egg with salt. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n,\nblender\n,\nlarge saucepan\n,\nlarge heavy-bottomed skillet\nNotes\nFeel free to substitute whatever fresh green vegetables you can find.
