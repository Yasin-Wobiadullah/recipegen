Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Take one piece of dough out of refrigerator and roll out on a lightly floured surface until it is a 9- by 9-inch square. Fold a 1-inch border in on all sides, making the tart approximately 8- by 8-inches. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat process with second piece of dough. Blind bake crusts for 10 minutes, then remove from oven and let cool slightly.\nPlace 1/2 cup jam on top of one crostata and use a knife or pastry brush to spread the jam to fill the interior of the tart. Place slices of peaches on top, forming two snug horizontal rows. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Repeat with second crostata. Brush edges of crostata with egg wash.\nBake crostatas until crust is golden and fruit is soft, about 30 minutes.
