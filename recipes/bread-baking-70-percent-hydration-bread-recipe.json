  "full_text": "70-Percent Hydration Bread Recipe | Bread Baking\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nActive\n35 mins\nChill Time\n12 hrs\nTotal\n13 hrs 10 mins\nServes\n10 servings\nMakes\n1 loaf\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n20\nounces\n(about\n3 2/3\ncups\n)\nbread flour\n14\nounces\nwater\n1\nteaspoon\ninstant\u00a0yeast\n1 1/2\nteaspoons\nsalt\n1\ntablespoon\nolive oil\nDirections\nCombine flour, water, yeast and salt in the bowl of your stand mixer. Mix with the paddle attachment or dough hook (this dough is wet enough that either will work) until all the ingredients are combined and the mixture begins to get smooth. You can also do this by hand with a wooden spoon or dough whisk. Drizzle the oil into a clean bowl, and move the dough to the oiled bowl, turning to coat on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator overnight.\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and let it rest, still in the covered bowl, for an hour at room temperature. Dust your work surface lightly with flour and turn the dough out. Grasp the two sides of the dough and pull gently outward until the dough is three times its original width. Fold the two sides inward, like you are folding a letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat this procedure. Turn the dough 90 degrees again and repeat. For this final fold, the dough should be stiffer and more elastic. Seal any seams and turn the dough over so the smooth side is on top. If you prefer, coax the dough into a more round shape.\nSprinkle some cornmeal on a baking sheet (or on a peel, if you prefer to bake on a stone) or place the bread on a piece of parchment paper, if you prefer using that to transfer it to your stone. Sprinkle some flour on top of the loaf - or use white rice flour, if you have it - and cover the loaf with plastic wrap. Since this dough is so wet, it's a good chance it will stick to the plastic wrap if you don't flour it. Set the dough aside to rise until doubled, about and hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.\nWhen the dough has doubled, spray the surface with water and place it in your preheated oven. Bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Move the dough to a rack to cool before slicing.\nYeast Breads",
