Season beef all over with salt. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat half of the oil over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add half of the beef and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes; transfer browned short ribs to a plate. Add remaining oil to pot and repeat browning process with the rest of the beef.\nReturn all beef to the pot, then add enough water to fully cover (about 2 to 3 quarts/liters) along with the coconut milk. Bring to a vigorous simmer and cook, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed to keep beef submerged, until beef is fully tender and can be pierced easily with a paring knife, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove pot from heat and set aside to cool, keeping beef submerged in cooking liquid, for at least 30 minutes. When cool, transfer beef to cutting board. Using a sharp knife, trim off and discard bones and cut beef into 1-inch pieces. Set aside, along with 1 cup (240ml) of beef cooking liquid and 2 tablespoons (30ml) rendered beef fat, which should have risen to surface of cooking liquid; remaining cooking liquid and fat can be refrigerated in an airtight container and saved for another use.\nMeanwhile, for the Roasted Shallots:\nPlace unpeeled shallots in a small, dry stainless steel or cast iron skillet and cook over medium heat, turning occasionally, until fully softened and blackened all over, about 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can grill the unpeeled shallots over low heat. Transfer shallots to a cutting board, allow to cool until comfortable to handle, then peel. Set aside.\nFor the Curry:\nRemove and discard the mid-rib from the makrut lime leaves; set half of the leaves aside. Stack remaining makrut lime leaves, fold in half widthwise, then slice into hair-thin strips; set aside separately.\nIn a 3-quart saucepan, combine reserved 2 tablespoons (30ml) rendered beef fat and 1/2 cup (120ml) coconut milk and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring often with a rubber spatula, until thickened slightly, about 3 minutes.\nAdd curry paste, stir vigorously to combine, and use rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the saucepan to fully incorporate the paste. Add the de-ribbed, whole lime leaves, and continue to cook, stirring and scraping constantly, until the fat begins to separate from the curry paste, about 3 minutes.\nAdd palm sugar and stir to melt. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until color of paste deepens to a dark brick-red, about 30 seconds. Add fish sauce, tamarind, remaining 1/2 cup (120ml) coconut milk, and reserved 1 cup (240ml) beef cooking liquid, and stir until well incorporated. Add beef and shallots, and gently stir to incorporate into curry. Lower heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally and being careful not to break apart the beef, until curry has slightly reduced to a saucy consistency, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, add sweet basil, and stir until wilted and incorporated.\nTransfer curry to a large serving bowl or divide between individual bowls and top with remaining thinly-sliced lime leaves. Serve with cooked jasmine rice.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\n3-quart saucepan\nNotes\nIf possible, try to purchase flanken-cut short ribs that are 1 1/2- to 2-inches thick (flanken-cut ribs are sawed across the bone so each strip of meat has multiple rib cross-sections in it; this is different from English-cut short ribs, in which each piece has a single rib bone in it). If you can't find flanken-cut short ribs, English-cut, bone-in short ribs will still work.\nWhen purchasing coconut milk, look for versions like this one from Aroy-D that have \"100% coconut milk\" as the only listed ingredient, rather than those made with coconut extract and water.\nMakrut lime leaves can be found at Southeast Asian and South Asian markets. If you\u2019re lucky you will find them fresh, but it is more common to find them frozen (note that they are often sold under a different name that we avoid using, as\nit is a derogatory term in some contexts\n).\nIf using store-bought curry paste, you can also use red curry paste and adjust it to make a panang paste. Pound 4 ounces (114g) red curry paste in a mortar and pestle with 1 stalk lemongrass (bottom 4 to 5 inches only, outer leaves discarded, tender core thinly sliced), 2 tablespoons roasted unsalted peanuts, 1/2 piece whole nutmeg, 2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds, 1/2 teaspoon whole cumin seeds, and 1/2 teaspoon white peppercorns.\nPalm sugar can be found in Thai markets, as well as some nationwide supermarket chains like HMart, and also online. You can soften palm sugar in the following ways: microwave at full power in a microwave-safe bowl for approximately 15 seconds, chop it up with a sharp knife and then pound it in a pestle and mortar, or create a concentrated syrup by using as little water you can and dissolving it in a pan on the stovetop.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe short ribs can be braised a day in advance; refrigerate them whole in their cooking liquid. The finished short rib curry can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on stovetop before serving. It is often assumed that curries, stews, and braises taste better the next day, but\nas we have covered\n, this is not always the case, especially with bright and acidic stews that lose their punch over time. While this flavor-muting phenomenon can be an issue for other Thai curries, this panang curry tastes just as good the next day. If you plan on making the curry a day in advance, hold off on adding the sweet basil leaves in Step 7; stir them in at the last minute when reheating the curry before serving.\nRead More\nGaeng Massaman Neua (Thai Massaman Curry with Beef)\nGaeng Khua Prik Si Krong Moo (Southern Thai Curry with Pork Ribs)\nGaeng Khiao Waan Gai (Thai Green Curry with Chicken)\nKare-Kare (Filipino Curry) Recipe\nHow to Stock a Thai Pantry\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nStovetop Beef\nShort Ribs\nPeanuts\nBeef Mains",
