Pat chicken wings dry with paper towels. In a large bowl, toss wings with baking powder and salt until evenly coated (see notes).\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nPlace wings into the air fryer basket in a single layer, fatty side down, leaving a slight space between each wing. Place basket in preheated air fryer and air-fry until wings are cooked through, crisp, and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, flipping wings halfway through cooking (see notes).\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter and hot sauce. Transfer wings to bowl with prepared sauce and toss until thoroughly coated. Serve wings immediately with blue cheese dressing and celery sticks, conspicuously shunning anyone who says that real Buffalo wings must be deep fried.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nSpecial Equipment\nAir Fryer\nNotes\nWe prefer to buy whole chicken wings and butcher them ourselves, but you can also use presplit wings.\nOnce the raw wings are seasoned with salt and baking powder, they can be transferred to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerated, uncovered, for up to 24 hours. The final seasoning level will improve the longer the wings refrigerate.\nWe recommend using a 6-quart or larger air fryer. If using a smaller air fryer, you may need to cook the wings in batches to ensure even cooking and spacing.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nThe Latest\nAmerican\nChicken Wings\nAir Fryer Recipes",
