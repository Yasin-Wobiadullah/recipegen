Pat ribs dry using paper towels and season with salt and pepper. When oil is shimmering, add as many ribs as fit in one layer. Cook, turning occasionally, until brown all over, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a large plate and repeat with remaining ribs.\nAdd remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the Dutch oven and reduce heat to medium. Add carrot, celery, and onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and continue cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it turns a burnished hue, about 2 minutes. Add wine, raise heat to medium-high and scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a spoon. Add vinegar, chicken stock, cider, Dijon, onion powder, bay leaves, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Season lightly with salt and pepper and stir to combine. Return pork ribs to the pot and bring to a boil.\nCover and transfer to oven to cook until fork-tender, removing lid during the last half-hour of cooking, about 1 hour and 45 minutes total.\nMeanwhile, for the Potatoes:\nPlace potatoes in a medium stockpot. Cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat and reduce to a simmer. Cook until tender when pierced with a fork.\nDrain and pass potatoes through ricer or food mill over a large bowl. Add melted butter and half of cream and milk to potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Whip on low speed using a hand mixer until butter, cream and milk are incorporated, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and whip until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Adjust to desired consistency with more cream and/or milk. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm until serving.\nWhen meat is done, remove from oven, discard bay leaves and thyme sprigs and skim fat from the top of sauce. Adjust seasoning, if needed. Serve with mashed potatoes, spooning the sauce on top.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nricer or food mill\n,\nhand mixer\nNotes\nThis dish can be made a day or two in advance. Time in the refrigerator will allow flavors to deepen and meld. As an added plus, it's easier to discard solidified fat from the top of the sauce when it's cold.\nPork Mains\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork\nYukon Gold Potatoes",
