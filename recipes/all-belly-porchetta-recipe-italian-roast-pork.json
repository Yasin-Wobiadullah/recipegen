  "full_text": "All-Belly Porchetta\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n4 hrs 35 mins\nActive\n2 hrs\nDry-Brining Time\n24 hrs\nTotal\n28 hrs 55 mins\nServes\n12\nto 15 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nwhole\nboneless, rind-on\npork belly\n, about\n12 to 15\npounds\n(\n5.4 to 6.8\nkg\n)\n2\ntablespoons whole\nblack peppercorns\n3\ntablespoons\nwhole\nfennel seeds\nKosher salt\n1\ntablespoon\ncrushed red pepper\n3\ntablespoons\nfinely chopped fresh\nrosemary\n,\nsage\n, or\nthyme\n12\ncloves\ngarlic\n, grated on a microplane grate\n2\nteaspoons\nbaking powder\nDirections\nPlace pork belly skin-side down on a large cutting board. Using a sharp chef's knife, score flesh at an angle using strokes about 1-inch apart. Rotate knife 90 degrees and repeat to create a diamond pattern in the flesh.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nToast peppercorns and fennel seeds in a small skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned and aromatic, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind until roughly crushed.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSeason pork liberally with salt then sprinkle with crushed pepper and fennel, red pepper, chopped herbs, and microplaned garlic. Use your hands to rub the mixture deeply into the cracks and crevices in the meat.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nRoll belly into a tight log and push to top of cutting board, seam-side down. Cut 12 to 18 lengths of kitchen twine long enough to tie around the pork and lay them down in regular intervals along your cutting board, about 1-inch apart each. Lay rolled pork seam-side down on top of strings. Working from the outermost strings towards the center, tie up roast tightly. Combine 2 tablespoons kosher salt with 2 teaspoons baking powder. Rub mixture over entire surface of pork.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIf roast is too large and unwieldy, carefully slice in half with a sharp chef's knife. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate at least overnight and up to 3 days. If desired, porchetta can also be frozen at this point for future use (see notes).\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Place pork in a V-rack set in a large roasting pan, or if cooking both halves at the same time, on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Place roasting pan in oven and roast until internal temperature of pork reaches 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C), about 2 hours, basting with pan drippings every half hour. If you'd like to cook potatoes along with the porchetta, see note. Continue roasting until a knife or skewer inserted into the pork shows very little resistance asides from the outer layer of skin, about 2 hours longer.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIncrease oven temperature to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) and continue roasting until completely crisp and blistered, about 20 to 30 minutes longer. Alternatively, you can remove the roast from the oven and tent with foil for up to 2 hours before finishing it in a preheated 500\u00b0F oven.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTent with foil and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice with a serrated knife into 1-inch thick disks and serve.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nRoasting pan with V-rack\nor\nrimmed baking sheet with metal rack\n, twine\nNotes\nHerbs and aromatics can be substituted or altered according to taste.\nI find it easiest to work with a whole belly at a time and if a smaller roast is desired, to split it in half and freeze half while still raw. Wrapped tightly in foil and plastic wrap, it should last for several months in the freezer. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and proceed with cooking steps as instructed.\nTo cook with potatoes, cut four pounds russet potatoes into two-inch chunks and boil in salted water until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Add to roasting pan in the middle of step 6, tossing them with the pig's drippings to coat. Continue roasting the porchetta with the potatoes in the pan. Turn the potatoes with a spatula every 45 minutes or so as they roast.\nIf you're using a rimmed baking sheet and still want to roast potatoes, you can pour off the drippings in the middle of step 6, toss them then the par-boiled potatoes, then place the potatoes on a separate rimmed baking sheet in a rack below the porchetta. Turn the potatoes every 45 minutes or so as they roast.\nRead More\nFive Seriously Delicious Hams for Your Easter Table\nDeep-Fried Sous Vide, 36-Hour All-Belly Porchetta\nPorchetta-Flavored Spatchcocked Turkey\nGarlic- and Herb-Roasted Pork Loin with Crackling and Spiced Apple Chutney\nPork Belly\nEaster\nChristmas Dinners\nItalian\nRoasted Pork"
