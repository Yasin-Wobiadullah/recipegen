Add 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil, swirling to coat wok. Add eggs, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, allowing eggs to form a solid layer at the bottom of the wok before slowly scrambling with a spatula, until eggs are gently scrambled in large curds, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer eggs to a plate and set aside. Wipe out wok of any remaining egg.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Finish:\nReturn wok to medium-high heat and heat until very lightly smoking. Add remaining 3 tablespoons (45ml) oil and swirl to coat the wok. Add scallion whites and garlic and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until fragrant, about 20 seconds; do not let them scorch. Add ginger and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd tomatoes, salt, and MSG (if using), and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until tomatoes soften and their juices come to a boil.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd Shaoxing wine followed by the soy sauce, pouring each around the sides of the wok so that they sizzle. Season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReduce heat to medium, then add eggs and white pepper, stirring to combine and breaking up any very large egg curds. Continue to cook until tomato-egg mixture is thoroughly combined and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStir in black vinegar, remove wok from heat, then stir in sesame oil, if using, and scallion greens.
