Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a 12-inch stainless steel skillet over high heat until just starting to smoke. Season scallops with salt and pepper and add half of scallops to skillet. Cook without moving until well browned on once side, about 45 seconds. Stir and continue cooking until lightly browned on remaining sides, about 30 seconds longer. Remove scallops with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Reheat oil until smoking and repeat with remaining scallops.\nAdd remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add bok choy and stir well. Stir fry until bright green and tender, about 1 minute. Pour in stock, soy sauce, sesame oil, and mirin. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to low.\nCook udon according to directions on the packaging. Drain in a colander and immediately transfer to the skillet. Toss well and cook over medium-high heat until noodles mostly absorb the sauce, about 30 seconds. Stir in scallops and cook until barely heated through. Sprinkle with togarashi (if desired) and serve immediately.\nNotes\nMirin is a sweet Japanese rice wine. It can be found in most Asian markets near the soy sauce and vinegar. Togarashi is a Japanese chili powder blend. It comes in several forms. Any of them can be used for this recipe.\nNoodles",
