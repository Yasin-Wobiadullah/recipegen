  "full_text": "How to Cut a Pomegranate (With Much Less Mess)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nTotal\n15 mins\nServes\n2\nto 4 servings\nMakes\n1 cup\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\npomegranate\nDirections\nPlace a large sheet of parchment paper on a cutting board. Working on top of the parchment paper, and using a very sharp knife, trim off about 1/4-inch from the blossom end and the crown end of the pomegranate, exposing the seeds inside; you will see lines of interior white pith stemming from the center to the peel like the spokes of a bicycle, marking the fruit's natural segments.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a paring knife, cut through the peel of the pomegranate from pole to pole where each line of pith meets the peel, being careful not to slice deeply into the pomegranate (you want to avoid cutting through the seeds as much as possible). Using your fingers, pry pomegranate apart into its natural segments.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFill a large bowl halfway with cold water. Working with 1 segment at a time, submerge segment in water and use fingers to gently separate seeds from outer skin and pith. Once all seeds are removed, discard outer skin, keeping seeds submerged in water (some pith may remain). Repeat with remaining segments.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nOnce all seeds have been removed from outer fruit skin, keep submerged under water and use fingers to separate seeds from any remaining pith and from each other. Once separated, let sit in water, untouched, until any remaining white pith separates and floats to the top of the water (seeds will remain on the bottom of the bowl), 3 to 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing a slotted spoon, spider, or fine-mesh strainer, collect and discard any floating pith. Drain seeds through a fine-mesh strainer and transfer to a paper towel-lined large plate or rimmed baking sheet. Gently blot dry with paper towels and discard any remaining white pith from seeds.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUse as needed or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMake Ahead and Storage\nPomegranate seeds can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. The arils freeze surprisingly well. Freeze in a single layer on a plastic wrap\u2013lined large plate or sheet tray (this prevents the arils from sticking to the plate and makes it easier to collect edges of wrap and gather arils together) until firm, about 30 minutes, then transfer to an airtight container and freeze for up to 2 months.\nHow-Tos\nThe Latest\nKnife Skills"
