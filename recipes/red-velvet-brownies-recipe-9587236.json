Line an 8- by 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nFor the Brownies:\nIn a medium microwave-safe bowl, combine butter and chocolate, and microwave on medium power until melted and smooth, stirring every 30 seconds, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nAdd granulated sugar and brown sugar to butter-chocolate mixture, and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, vanilla, and food coloring (if using) until smooth. Add flour, cocoa powder, and salt; using a flexible spatula, fold dry ingredients into chocolate mixture until smooth and no streaks of flour remain. Add vinegar, and fold until incorporated. (If you plan to serve the brownies without the frosting, whisk the eggs and sugar together in a separate bowl before incorporating it into chocolate and butter mixture, which will ensure your top is shiny and crackly.)\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nTransfer batter to prepared baking pan and bake until top is crackly and a toothpick inserted into the center has some moist crumbs attached, 28 to 32 minutes. Remove from oven and let brownies cool completely in pan on a wire rack, about 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nFor the Cream Cheese Frosting:\nIn a large bowl, combine cream cheese and butter and, using an electric hand mixer, beat on low speed until smooth and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add vanilla and salt, and beat until fully combined, about 10 seconds. Add confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, beating after each addition until incorporated. Increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy and smooth, about 20 seconds. (Alternatively, frosting can be prepared in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.)\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nUsing an offset spatula or flexible spatula, spread frosting evenly across cooled brownies. Refrigerate until frosting is set, about 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nSpecial Equipment\n8- by 8-inch baking pan, medium microwave-safe bowl, wire rack, electric hand mixer or stand mixer, offset spatula\nNotes\nBrownies made without the food coloring won\u2019t have the signature hue of red velvet cake.\nMake sure to use natural cocoa, and not Dutch processed cocoa in this recipe. The higher acidity in natural cocoa reacts with the vinegar to produce a mahogany hue.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe frosting and brownies can be made up to 3 days ahead before assembling and serving. Store the frosting in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Tightly wrap the brownies in plastic or transfer them to an airtight container and refrigerate them.\u00a0 Before serving, let frosting come to room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes, then use an electric hand mixer or stand mixer to beat until smooth and creamy.\nFrosted brownies can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\nDesserts\nThe Latest\nChocolate\nDessert Bars\nValentine's Day",
