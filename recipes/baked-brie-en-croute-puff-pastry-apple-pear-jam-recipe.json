Add apple and pear and cook, stirring occasionally, until fruit is tender and has released most of its liquid, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in sugar, cinnamon stick or ground cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 12 to 15 minutes longer. Discard cinnamon stick, if used. Remove from heat and let compote cool to room temperature.\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nUsing a sharp knife, cut cheese in half horizontally (through the middle). Lay one half on a work surface, cut side up, and spread 3 tablespoons (45ml) of compote evenly over it. Place second half on top and spread another 3 tablespoons (45ml) compote over it.\nPlace puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface and roll to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Set prepared cheese in center of square, fold dough up and over, and pleat it together on top to enclose cheese. Gently pinch dough together in center to seal gathered pleats. You can tie a bit of kitchen twine on top to hold pleats together if you like, but this is not essential. If dough is no longer cold, chill wrapped cheese for at least 20 minutes. (Cheese can be wrapped tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated until ready to bake.)\nSet prepared cheese wheel on prepared baking sheet. Brush dough evenly with egg wash. Bake until pastry is crisp and golden brown all over, 25 to 35 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes, then transfer to a platter. Serve any remaining compote alongside.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n, parchment paper, rolling pin, pastry brush, kitchen twine (optional)\nNotes\nIf possible, use a triple-cream bloomy rind cheese, which has a higher fat content than a double-cream cheese and melts better.\nRead More\nSimple Baked Brie With Honey and Pistachios\nBaked Brie en Cro\u00fbte With Thyme and Fig Jam\nSavory\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nBrie\nApple\nPear"
