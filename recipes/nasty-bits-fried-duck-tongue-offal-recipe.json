Add the duck tongues and mix evenly. Leave them in the marinade for half an hour, turning occasionally.\nRemove the duck tongues from the mixture, but do not wipe dry. Add the egg white and the cornstarch to the duck tongues and mix evenly.\nMeanwhile, bring the oil to 350\u00b0F at the base of a wok. Gently slip the duck tongues into the oil, taking care not to splash the surface. Stir the tongues around slowly in the oil to prevent sticking.\nDeep-fry 1 to 2 minutes, until the tongues are golden-brown and crisp. Remove the tongues from the wok and let them blot briefly on a paper towel. (Depending on how much oil you want to use, cook the tongues in batches.) Serve while crisp and piping hot.\nDuck\nFrying",
