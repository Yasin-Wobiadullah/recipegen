Add all simmering ingredients to pan and bring water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until feet are tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nRemove feet from cooking liquid, which can be reserved for another purpose. Allow feet to cool.\nWhisk eggs and flour/salt mixture in a medium bowl. Dip feet into batter, shaking off excess flour. If needed, dip the feet twice, to ensure they're fully coated.\nIn a wok, bring 1 quart (900ml) oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Add feet in batches and deep-fry until batter is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Have a lid ready in the event of splattering oil. Serve immediately, adding a sprinkling of sea salt if needed.\nSpecial Equipment\n2-quart\nsaut\u00e9 pan\n,\nwok\nor other vessel for deep-frying\nNotes\nYou can skip the batter and fry the feet plain. Dress with more soy sauce and chili oil, as desired.\nFried Chicken\nStovetop Chicken\nChicken",
