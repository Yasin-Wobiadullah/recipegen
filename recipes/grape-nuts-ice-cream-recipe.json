Split vanilla bean lengthwise and use the tip of the knife to scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds to the cream mixture along with a pinch of salt. Whisking occasionally, heat mixture over medium-low heat until bubbles begin to form along the edges of the pan. Remove from heat and add heated cream mixture to the eggs one tablespoon at a time while whisking constantly to temper the eggs.\nOnce the cream mixture and eggs have been combined, return to the saucepan and heat on medium-low until mixture coats back of a spoon or spatula and line drawn with a finger leaves a distinct trail. Mixture should register 170\u00b0 to 175\u00b0F (77\u00b0 to 79\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, do not allow mixture to overheat.\nPour custard into a medium bowl and set over an ice bath. Let cool at room temperature for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, then cover and refrigerate for 2 more hours or up to overnight until completely chilled. Churn chilled custard according to your ice cream maker's instructions, adding the Grape-Nuts in the last 5 minutes of churning. Transfer ice cream into a bowl or container that will hold 1 quart.
