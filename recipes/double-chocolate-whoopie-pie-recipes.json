Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, oil, egg, butter, and vanilla. Pour wet ingredients into dry and whisk until smooth.\nUsing a 1 1/2 ounce ice cream or portion scoop, scoop out 18 to 20 mounds of batter on prepared sheets. Bake until firm to touch, 8 to 9 minutes, rotating pans from top to bottom and front to back halfway through baking. Transfer parchment sheets (with cakes still attached) to wire rack to cool completely.\nTo Make the Filling:\nIn a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk milk with flour, cocoa powder, and salt until combined. Cook, gently whisking, until mixture thickens and just begins to boil (one to two large bubbles will pop to surface). Cover with plastic wrap and let mixture cool to room temperature (see notes).\nIn the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with whip attachment, whip butter, shortening, sugar, and vanilla on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add cooked flour mixture and continue to whip until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low and mix in melted chocolate (see notes).\nDivide filling between half of the cakes. Sandwich together with remaining cakes. Serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n1 1/2-ounce ice cream or portion scoop (holds 3 tablespoons),\nstand mixer\nfitted with whisk attachment,\nrimmed baking sheets\n, parchment paper\nNotes\nMake sure to cover the cooked flour mixture with plastic wrap so that it doesn't develop a skin on the surface.\nIf, after whipping, the cream seems too soft to fill the cakes, chill it in the bowl for a few minutes to firm up a little, then whip again.\nRead More\nHomemade Devil Dogs\nThe Best Chocolate for Baking\nFlour Frosting (a.k.a.
