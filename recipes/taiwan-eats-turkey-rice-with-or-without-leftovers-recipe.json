Choose a large pot with a lid, such as a Dutch oven, and place a steamer rack inside. Fill the pot with 2 cups (475ml) of water. Place the turkey on a dish that fits inside the pot and sits atop the steamer rack. (In order to save the turkey drippings, the turkey should not be placed directly on a rack with holes.) Bring water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover the pot. Steam the turkey until its internal temperature close to the bone reaches 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C), about 30 minutes. Let cool. Reserve the juices and drippings.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nOnce the turkey meat has cooled, pull the meat into bite-size shreds by hand and discard the bones and skin.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nHeat the vegetable oil in a small pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the sliced shallots and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer immediately to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve the cooking oil.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nCombine the shallot cooking oil with 1/2 cup (120ml) of reserved juices and drippings from the steamed turkey. Add water, sugar, soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorns, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and white pepper. Add half of the fried shallots, saving the rest for garnish. Whisk mixture over medium heat to dissolve sugar. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer, uncovered until sauce is reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Strain sauce and discard solids.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nTo serve, scoop rice into individual serving bowls and top with a mound of the shredded turkey meat. Spoon the sauce over each bowl. Finish with the fried shallots and cilantro for garnish.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n, steamer rack\nNotes\nTo prepare this dish using leftover Thanksgiving turkey meat, skip step 1 and substitute the raw turkey with 2 cups packed, pre-roasted turkey meat and 1/2 cup (120ml) of its reserved drippings.\nTurkey Mains\nAsian\nRice & Grains\nTurkey"
