Toast by microwaving on high power for 2 minutes. Continue microwaving at 30-second intervals until golden brown and nutty, 3 to 8 minutes total. Alternatively, toast in a toaster oven set at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) until golden brown and nutty, about 15 minutes. Set aside.\nHeat 4 tablespoons oil in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add eggplant and cook, tossing occasionally, until completely softened and browned in spots (eggplant will initially absorb all of the oil then slowly release some of it), about 6 minutes.\nPush eggplant to the side of the skillet and add 2 more tablespoons oil to the center. Add scallions, celery, bell pepper, and garlic and toss to combine with the eggplant. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until vegetables are softened and aromatic, about 3 minutes longer.\nAdd reserved pine nuts, mint, parsley, tomato paste, ground cinnamon, raisins, capers, sugar, red wine vinegar, and balsamic vinegar and toss to combine. Drizzle in remaining olive oil and bring to a simmer, adding water a tablespoon at a time as necessary until caponata has a sauce-like consistency that is loose, but doesn't run freely over a plate. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nLet mixture cool to room temperature or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to a week. Serve at room temperature garnished with extra mint leaves and a drizzle of olive oil if desired. Serve with toasted bread or pasta.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet\nRead More\nSicilian-Style Broccoli Rabe With Eggplant and Capers\nPasta Alla Norma (Sicilian Pasta With Eggplant, Tomatoes, and Ricotta Salata)\nRoasted Eggplant With Tahini, Pine Nuts, and Lentils\nBraised Eggplant With Garlic and Basil\nFish-Fragrant Eggplants (Sichuan Braised with Garlic, Ginger, and Chiles)\nCondiments & Sauces\nPine Nuts\nEggplant\nSnacks & Appetizers",
