Lightly prick chilled pie shell all over bottom in 1/2-inch intervals. Line pie shell with a double layer 14-inch square of parchment paper or aluminum foil. Fill with sugar, pie weights, or dried beans.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer to a parchment or foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). Carefully remove liner and pie weights from crust and continue to bake until the crust is cooked through and just starting to turn golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nIn a large bowl, whisk eggs, butter, milk, and vanilla together until smooth. Pour sugar into the egg mixture in a slow steady stream, whisking as you go until well combined. Whisk cornmeal, flour, vinegar, and salt into the mixture until smooth.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nPour the filling into the parbaked pie shell. Bake until the filling is lightly browned and center of the pie is just set, but still jiggles slightly when shaken, and register 180\u2109(82\u2103), 45 to 50 minutes. If necessary, shield edges of crust with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, about 4 hours. Slice and serve.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\n9-inch pie plate\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPie can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. The pie can be served chilled or at room temperature.\nRead More\nSerious Entertaining: A Real Deal Barbecue Feast\nPies\nBaking",
