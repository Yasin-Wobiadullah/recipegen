Let cool, with the orange zest and cinnamon still in the pot. Scrape off any white foam.\nOnce syrup has cooled, remove zest and cinnamon. Then combine honey syrup and vodka in a sealable glass jar, seal, and shake. Serve immediately, or for better flavor, allow to rest for a minimum of 12 hours. Store at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nMason jar\nNotes\nHoney's flavor varies greatly depending on the type and region. Clover honey is the mildest and most common variety and is sold in most grocery stores. Taste whichever honey you use first to decide if you want to use additional flavors like orange zest and cinnamon when making the syrup. The proportions in this recipe were developed for use with vodka. If you would like to substitute another spirit such as bourbon or rum, however, you may want to use slightly less honey to adjust for the spirit's natural sweet flavor.\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines"
