With mixer running, gradually add sugar. Continue whipping until stiff, glossy peaks from, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Fold in coconut.\nUsing 2 soup spoons, scoop out meringues 1 at a time into an egg-like shape and gently slide into simmering coconut milk mixture (there will be 8 total\u2014poach in batches of 4). Poach 1 to 2 minutes, then turn over and poach for another 1 to 2 minutes. Meringues will puff slightly and firm up, then deflate as they cool. Transfer to prepared baking sheet and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.\nStrain the coconut milk mixture into bowl and wipe out saucepan.\nFor the Coconut Cr\u00e8me Anglaise:\nWhisk eggs yolks and sugar in large bowl until very thick and pale yellow.\nSlowly pour warm coconut milk mixture into egg mixture. Return mixture to large saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thickened: mixture should coat the back of spoon, and, if you run a finger across it, a clear trail will be left, 3 to 5 minutes. Don\u2019t cook mixture over 180\u00b0F\u2014it will curdle.\nStrain sauce into bowl, then stir in rum and vanilla.

Line baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly coat with nonstick cooking spray.\nCombine sugar and 1/2 cup water in medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, stirring over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and boil, swirling pan occasionally, until syrup turns amber, 15 to 20 minutes. Immediately remove from heat.\nCarefully add remaining 1/2 cup water and vanilla: mixture will bubble and sputter. Once syrup has settled, return pan to heat and cook, stirring over medium heat, until temperature reaches 230\u00b0F on candy thermometer.\nIn medium bowl, combine cashews and 1/4 cup of syrup. Lightly coat both sides of rubber spatula with nonstick cooking spray, then scrape out mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Flatten out into single layer.\nBake crunch until deep golden and fragrant, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to cooling rack and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nBreak into pieces. Cashew crunch may be prepared up to 2 days in advance and stored at room temperature.\nFor the Caramel Sauce:\nTransfer remaining caramel to microwave-safe pitcher or glass liquid measuring cup. Caramel sauce may be prepared up to 2 days in advance and stored at room temperature. If it hardens, microwave for 20 to 30 seconds until it becomes liquid.\nTo Serve:\nDivide cr\u00e8me anglaise among 8 dessert plates. Place a meringue on top of each pool, then top with cashew crunch and drizzle with caramel.\nSpecial equipment\n2 large baking sheets, parchment paper, medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, wooden mixing spoon, candy thermometer, rubber spatula, cooling rack, microwave-safe pitcher or liquid measuring cup, paper towels, electric mixer, 2 soup spoons, strainer, large heavy-bottomed saucepan, plastic wrap\nThis Recipe Appears In\nDulces: Islas Flotantes de Coco (Coconut Floating Islands)\nDesserts\nCoconut Milk & Cream\nCashews"
