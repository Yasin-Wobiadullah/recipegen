Cover with water and bring to the boil. Boil for 5 minutes, then drain. This removes the initial scum given off by the trotters.\nNow place the blanched trotters back in the pot with the vegetables, thyme, peppercorns and Madeira and cover with stock. Cover and place in a gentle oven. Cook for at least 3 hours, until the trotters are totally giving. At this point, strain the cooking liquor and keep. When the trotters have cooled enough to handle (but don't let them go cold, as they become much harder to deal with), pick all the flesh, fat and skin off them, tearing the skin into shreds. Add to the cooking liquor, seal in a jar and refrigerator.\nYou now have Trotter Gear, nuduals of giving wobbly trotter captured in a splendid jelly. One can sense its potential even now.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Nasty Bits: Pig's Foot\nPork"
