Melt butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat, then add onion, bell pepper, sugar, sage, salt, paprika, and cayenne. Cook, stirring, until onions are translucent and just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes, then add corn. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until no water remains in skillet, another 8 to 10 minutes, then stir in cornmeal and remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nIn a small bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and cream, then pour into corn mixture. Stir well to combine, sprinkle with cheese, and bake until softly set, about 20 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil only until lightly browned, just a minute or two more.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch\ncast iron skillet\nNotes\nThis casserole can be prepared in a 12-inch cast iron skillet, but will cook faster on the stove and in the oven, so use the visual cues as your guide. If you don't have a cast iron skillet, prepare the casserole in a large stainless steel skillet, then transfer to a 7- by 11-inch glass or ceramic dish to bake.\nRead More\nYellow Squash Casserole Recipe\nCorn\nVegetarian Sides\nSavory\nCheddar Cheese\nFall Sides"
