Place a wire rack on a foil-lined baking sheet. Divide meat into four equal 6-ounce portions and gently shape each one into a patty 4.5-inches wide by approximately 1/2-inch thick. Place on a flat surface and create a dimple in the center of the patty by pushing down with three or four fingers. The dimple should be about 1/4 of an inch deep and 3 inches across. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nPlace patties on prepared baking sheet. Broil in preheated oven for 3 minutes until top is well-browned. Flip patties and continue to broil until center reads 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare, about 3 minutes longer. Adjust cooking time if you want them more or less cooked.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nTop each patty with a slice of cheese, place back under broiler for 25 seconds to melt, place on buns, top as desired, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nSpecial Equipment\nWire rack\n, aluminum foil,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nClassic Smashed Burgers Recipe\nThick and Juicy Burgers Recipe\nThe Fake Shack (or the Shack Burger at Home) Recipe\nOklahoma-Style Onion Burgers Recipe\nBurgers\nBeef\nAmerican\nGround Beef"
