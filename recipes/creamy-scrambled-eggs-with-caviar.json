Melt butter in 8-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add eggs and cook, stirring continuously until they begin to set around the edges, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook, gently stirring and scraping constantly until eggs are thick enough that the spatula leaves a trail in the bottom, about 1 minute longer. Continue to cook, stirring more vigorously to prevent eggs from forming large curds until eggs are just barely set and no liquid remains. Add heavy cream, stir to combine, and transfer eggs to serving plate.\nServe eggs immediately with toast, passing caviar, sour cream, and red onions at the table.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nChristmas\nStovetop Eggs\nScrambled Eggs\nFish",
