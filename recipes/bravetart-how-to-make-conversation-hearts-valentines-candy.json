Whisk with a fork to combine; let stand five minutes. Meanwhile, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Place the bowl of gelatin over hot water and stir occasionally until melted. (If using a hand mixer you can use a water bath too, or use a microwave-safe bowl and zap the gelatin at 5-second intervals until melted.)\nTo Make the Sugar Paste:\nFit the stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix melted gelatin/Sprite mixture with about two cups of powdered sugar and until it forms a sauce-like consistency. Add in the salt and continue adding powdered sugar, a few cups at a time, until a dough forms. You may not need all of the powdered sugar; use any excess for rolling out the paste later.\nThe finished candy \"dough\" should be thick, malleable, and not particularly sticky. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead (using more powdered sugar to prevent sticking if necessary) until smooth. With a knife or bench scraper, divide the dough into six portions, or however many colors/flavor portions you plan on having. Place all the dough portions into a zippy bag, or wrap each in plastic\nTo Flavor and Color the Candies:\nIf you have disposable gloves, this next step will be easy, just like kneading bread dough. If you don't, you'll knead the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap or through a large zippy bag. Take one portion of dough, unwrap, and make an indentation in the center with your fingers. In the well, place a few drops of the desired extract/freeze-dried fruit powder along with a touch of food coloring (if using).\nKnead the dough until the color is perfectly uniform, about 3 minutes. Taste a pinch of the dough and adjust the flavor if need be.\nTo Roll and Cut the Candy:\nHave a parchment-lined sheet tray ready. On a surface dusted very lightly with powdered sugar, roll the dough out with a pin to 1/4-inch thickness. Use a heart-shaped cutter to stamp out the candies. You can gather and re-roll the scraps as many times as you like. Transfer the cut-outs to the prepared tray and set aside. Repeat the flavoring/coloring, rolling, and cutting process with remaining dough.\nTo Dry the Candy:\nLet the cut-out hearts air dry, uncovered, for at least 24 hours. If you have pets or kids, be sure to set the trays somewhere out of the way. After 24 hours, sample one of the candies. If the texture is to your liking, you're done! If you prefer a harder, crunchier texture, flip the hearts over to expose their bottom sides and dry another 24 hours. In either case, decorate the candies (or not) with a food pen. Store in an airtight container, indefinitely.\nSpecial Equipment\nDisposable gloves, rolling pin, heart-shaped mini cutters\nNotes\nAll measurements are in weights, as volume measures can be very imprecise. I strongly recommend using a scale for all pastry projects. Serious Eats' recommended kitchen scale is the Oxo Good Grips Scale with Pull Out Display.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBraveTart: Make Your Own Conversation Hearts\nCandy\nStovetop\nValentine's Day"
