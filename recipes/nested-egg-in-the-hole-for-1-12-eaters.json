  "full_text": "Nested Egg-in-a-Hole for 1 1/2 Eaters Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n20 mins\nServes\n1 serving\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nslice\nhigh-quality sandwich bread,\nsuch as\nshokupan\n1\ntablespoon\n(\n12\ng\n)\nunsalted butter\n, divided\n1\nchicken egg\n1\nquail egg\n(see note)\nKosher salt\n, black pepper, and herbs (such as chives) as desired\nDirections\nPreheat a cast iron or non-stick griddle or skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cut a circular hole out of the center of the slice of bread using a biscuit cutter or empty jar that leaves about 1/2-inch clearance on the sides. Set the slice of bread with the hole missing aside. Using a smaller biscuit cutter or empty jar, cut a smaller hole inside the circular piece of bread. You should now have three pieces of bread: a large rectangle with a circle missing, a circle with a smaller circle missing, and a very small circle.\nAdd half the butter to the skillet or griddle, spread it around, then add the bread. Cook, moving the bread around occasionally, until the bottom side is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Slide the bread to the side of the griddle or set it aside on a plate.\nAdd the remaining butter and spread it around. Return the bread to the butter with the browned-side-up. Crack a chicken egg into the large hole and a quail egg into the smaller hole. Season both with salt. Cover with a domed lid and cook until the bottom is browned and the top has barely set. Alternatively, cook uncovered until the bottom is browned, then carefully flip the egg and toast to cook the egg through.\nSeason to taste with black pepper and herbs, and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\n1 1/2-inch and 3-inch biscuit cutter, or two empty jars (about 3-inches and 1 1/2-inches), cast iron or nonstick skillet, domed pan lid\nNotes\nQuail eggs can be found in most Asian grocery stores.\nEggs\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nFried Eggs\nStovetop Eggs\nQuick Breakfast",
