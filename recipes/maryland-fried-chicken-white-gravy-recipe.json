In a shallow bowl, season flour with salt and pepper. Season chicken lightly with salt and pepper and dredge each piece in flour, shaking off excess. Reserve seasoned flour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large cast iron or heavy nonstick skillet, heat 1/4 inch oil over high heat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Carefully lay chicken pieces in hot oil, skin side down, and fry until lightly browned, 1-2 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken and brown lightly on other side. Turn chicken once more so that it's skin side down again and cover skillet. Cook, covered, for 2 minutes. Remove cover and continue frying chicken, turning as necessary, until well browned on both sides and just cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and sprinkle lightly with salt. Transfer to oven to keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPour off grease into a heatproof container and return skillet to burner. Lower heat to medium-high, add butter, and cook until melted and foamy, whisking to scrape up any browned bits. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved seasoned flour, whisking to form a paste. Whisk in milk and cook until a smooth gravy forms that coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. Season gravy with salt and a generous amount of black pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLoad chicken onto plates and pour gravy on top. Serve with sides like ears of corn, soft white bread and butter, and mashed potatoes.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\ncast iron skillet\n,\nwhisk\nNotes\nThe chicken backbone can be set aside to later make\na flavorful stock\n.\nRead More\nChicken-Fried Chicken With Cream Gravy\nThe Best Buttermilk-Brined Southern Fried Chicken\nChicken Mains\nAmerican\nFried Chicken\nWhole Chicken"
