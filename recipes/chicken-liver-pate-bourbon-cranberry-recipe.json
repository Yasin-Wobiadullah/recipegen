Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet until smoking. Cook half of the livers, turning, until browned on both sides and pink in the middle, about 4 minutes. Transfer livers to the bowl of a food processor. Add 1 more tablespoon oil, heat until smoking and repeat with remaining livers.\nAdd remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet, add shallots and thyme and cook, stirring until softened, about 2 minutes. Add bourbon and cook, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet, until almost evaporated (you can flame the bourbon, but use caution as flames can leap high from the skillet). Add cider and cook until slightly reduced. Scrape shallots and any remaining liquid into food-processor bowl with livers.\nAdd butter and process, stopping to scrape down sides, until a smooth pur\u00e9e\u00a0forms.\nSet a fine-mesh strainer over a large mixing bowl and, using a wooden spoon or ladle, press and plunge liver pur\u00e9e\u00a0through it. Season liver pur\u00e9e\u00a0with salt and pepper and scrape into a large ramekin or terrine, tapping against counter to remove air pockets. Smooth surface, then press plastic wrap directly against surface and chill in refrigerator until set, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\nIn a glass measuring cup, sprinkle gelatin on top of cranberry juice and let stand for 15 minutes.\nTransfer cranberry juice and gelatin to a small saucepan and stir in sugar. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved and juice is simmering. Remove from heat and let cool.\nGently pour cooled cranberry juice on top of liver pur\u00e9e. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until cranberry juice sets, at least 2 hours. P\u00e2t\u00e9 can be refrigerated for up to 5 days before serving.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n,\nfood processor\n, 1 or 1 1/2-quart ramekin or p\u00e2t\u00e9 terrine\nNotes\nYou can use sweetened cranberry juice, but if you do, omit the sugar.\nPat\u00e9s & Rillettes\nChicken\nCranberry\nThanksgiving Appetizers\nChristmas Appetizers"
