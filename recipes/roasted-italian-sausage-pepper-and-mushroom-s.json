Add sausage links and mushrooms to a large baking sheet, and toss with a tablespoon of oil and a pinch of salt. Add red bell peppers, green bell peppers, onion, garlic, and oregano to a second large baking sheet and toss with a tablespoon of oil and a pinch of salt.\nTransfer both baking sheets to the oven and cook for 15 minutes. Remove baking sheet with sausages and mushrooms. Use a meat thermometer to check if the sausages are cooked through, around 140\u00b0F. The mushrooms should be tender. Using a pair of tongs, stir the pepper and onion mixture. Cook until onions and peppers are tender and starting to brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. At this time, wrap Italian rolls in aluminum foil and set in the oven to warm.\nWhile the peppers and onions finish cooking, warm remaining two tablespoons in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add sausage links, and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Set aside.\nWhen peppers and onion are done, carefully remove pan from the oven. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and add in the cooked mushrooms, fresh basil, and balsamic vinegar. Toss well and season with a pinch of salt, if necessary.\nRemove rolls from oven and unwrap. If not already cut, slice horizontally through the roll, stopping a half-inch from the other side. Load each with an Italian sausage, a generous scoop of the pepper and onion mixture. If you need more heat, add some giardiniera.\nSandwiches\nRoasting\nSausages\nCremini & Button Mushrooms\nBell Peppers",
