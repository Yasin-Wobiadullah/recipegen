Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nCut each avocado in half and remove the pit. Using a spoon, scrape out the center of each halved avocado so that it is large enough to accommodate an egg (about 1 1/2 tablespoons). Squeeze lime juice over the avocados and season with salt, then place on prepared baking sheet, cut side up.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nPlace a small sieve over a small bowl. Working with 1 egg at a time, crack the egg into the sieve and let sit until the watery parts of the egg white drain off; discard watery egg white. Carefully, pour the drained egg into the center of an avocado. Don\u2019t worry if some of the white spills out as long as the yolk is intact. Repeat with remaining eggs. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nBake in the oven until whites are set and yolk is runny, about 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from oven and garnish with mustard and chives.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nBreakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nSavory\nBaked Eggs\nAvocado"
