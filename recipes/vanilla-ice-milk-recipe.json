When no lumps of cornstarch remain, add exactly 14 ounces of the milk (about 1 2/3 cups; 396g) and whisk to combine. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly but not vigorously, until it begins to simmer. This will take about 6 minutes; if the process seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, set a timer and continue cooking and whisking for exactly 1 minute. This ensures the cornstarch is fully hydrated.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nImmediately transfer mixture to a large bowl, then whisk in remaining milk, along with the vanilla (see note). Bearing in mind that the ice milk will taste substantially less sweet once frozen, season with an additional pinch of salt, if desired. Cover and refrigerate the base until cold, thick, and no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), about 3 hours. (This process can be sped along with an ice bath if time is of the essence; in that case, a stainless steel bowl will help cool the base even faster.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nChurn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Meanwhile, place a quart-sized container and flexible spatula in the freezer. When the ice milk looks fluffy and thick, shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape it into the chilled container. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against the surface of the ice milk, then close lid and freeze until firm enough to scoop, about 4 hours. (The time will vary depending on the material and dimensions of the container.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n,\nice cream maker\n, nonreactive, freezer-safe container\nNotes\nInstead of vanilla, try stirring in your favorite extracts to taste, or try flavoring it with ingredients such as freeze-dried coffee powder, powdered green tea, or ground spices. The milk can also be steeped with vanilla beans, tea leaves, dried flower buds, whole spices, and other non-acidic flavoring agents.\nRead More\nRicotta Gelato\nButtermilk Ice Cream\nIce Cream\nStovetop\nSummer Desserts\nMilk",
