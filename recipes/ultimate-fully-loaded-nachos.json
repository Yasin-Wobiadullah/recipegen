Heat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Add 1/3 of tortilla chips and cook, agitating and flipping them constantly with a wire mesh spider until bubbles slow to a trickle and chips are pale golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined bowl, season with salt, and toss. Allow to drain for 30 seconds, then transfer to a second bowl. Repeat with remaining chips in 2 more batches.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nLayer 1/2 of chips in the bottom of a rimmed 9-by-13-inch baking sheet or baking dish, leaving a large space in the center. Drizzle with 1/2 of cheese sauce and 1/2 of refried beans. Top with 1/2 sliced pickled jalape\u00f1os and 1/2 black beans and sprinkle with 1/2 grated cheese.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nLayer with remaining 1/2 of chips, maintaining the space in the center. Drizzle with remaining cheese sauce and refried beans. Top with remaining jalape\u00f1os and black beans and sprinkle all over with remaining grated cheese. Bake until grated cheese is completely melted, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nTop with pico de gallo and drizzle all over with crema. Sprinkle cotija on top and garnish with cilantro leaves and radish slices. Mound sour cream and guacamole side-by-side in the space in the center of chips. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Two Bites\nSpecial Equipment\nWire mesh spider,\nprobe\nor\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nYou can use as many or as few of the toppings as you wish. High quality store-bought tortilla chips can be used in place of the fresh, but the chips will not stay crisp as long.\nThis recipe requires that you complete many other recipes before you begin. All recipes except for the guacamole can be completed several days in advance, leaving only the guacamole, fresh radishes and cilantro, and construction for the final day just before serving. If using chilled pre-made toppings, warm them up in the microwave or on the stovetop before applying, adding a little water if necessary to the cheese sauce or refried beans if they are too thick.\nRead More\nMaking Nachos for the Super Bowl?
