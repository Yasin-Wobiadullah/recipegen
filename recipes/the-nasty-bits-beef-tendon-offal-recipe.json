Add a half cup or water to partially cover the tendons. Bring the water to boil; then reduce to a steady simmer and cook for 4 hours. (If you have a pressure cooker, you can cut down on the steaming time by half for a total of two hours cooking time instead of four.) Add additional water as needed to ensure that the bottom of the pot does not dry out.\nRemove the tendons from the pot and set aside the simmering liquid for another use. Let the tendons cool to room temperature; then refrigerate until the tendons are completely firm.\nThinly slice the tendons into 1/8-inch slices. (The cooked tendons may be kept in the refrigerator for a week or more, so you may slice as much or as little you need each time.)\nMix the tendons with the soy sauce, chile oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, and sesame oil. Ideally, let the dish rest for at least 2 hours at room temperature to allow the slices of tendon to fully absorb the flavors of the dressing. After 2 hours, taste a slice of the tendon and add more seasoning, as needed. Toss with the chopped cilantro and green onion. Serve as a cold dish.\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric or stovetop\npressure cooker\n(optional)\nRead More\nEmbrace the Wobble: Why I Love Jellied Foods and You Should Too\nPig's Ears Two Ways Recipe\nPressure Cooked Beef"
