Pour sauce over chicken and leeks and mix until fully incorporated; taste and season again with salt and pepper if necessary. Allow the mixture to fully cool before assembling pie.\nTo Assemble the Pie\n: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Divide puff pastry into 2 pieces and roll each piece into a 9- by 11-inch rectangle. Place 1 rectangle on an aluminium foil-lined baking sheet, then place the filling in the center of the pie, leaving a 1-inch border. Brush the border with beaten egg, then place the remaining sheet of pastry on top. Pinch the edges closed, then brush the edges with egg and fold each edge over. Brush the rest of the pie with egg. With the tip of a knife, make two holes for the center for the steam to escape, Gently score the top of the pie. Bake until pie is golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve.\nSerious Eats / Sydney Oland\nRead More\nChicken Pot Pie With Buttermilk Biscuit Topping\nIndividual Double-Crusted Chicken Pot Pies\nBritish\nSavory\nChicken Legs\nLeeks\nPies"
