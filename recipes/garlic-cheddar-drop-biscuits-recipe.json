Sift flour into a large bowl. If using butter, dice into 1/4-inch pieces, then toss with flour and rub with your fingertips until no visible bits remain. Whisk in parsley or chives, baking powder, sugar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne. Add the finely grated cheddar, and toss until well combined. Pour in buttermilk, and stir with a flexible spatula to form a soft dough.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWith a pair of spoons, drop the dough into 10 large portions on a parchment-lined half sheet pan (it's fine to eyeball their size; no need to weigh). Bake until golden brown all over, about 25 minutes. Cool 5 minutes and serve\u2014the flavor of the biscuits will intensify as they cool. In an airtight container, leftovers will keep up to 24 hours at room temperature; warm in a hot oven to serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nHalf sheet pan\n, parchment paper, Parmesan grater or\nmicroplane\n(see notes)\nNotes\nThe consistency of these biscuits, and even their yield, depends on using a fine, Microplane or Parmesan-style grater for the cheese. I love Microplane's fine grater because it's extra wide, and makes quick work of the cheese.\nRead More\nQuick and Easy Drop Biscuits\nThe Food Lab's Buttermilk Biscuits\nLight and Fluffy Biscuits\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Biscuits\nBiscuits\nButtermilk\nSides"
