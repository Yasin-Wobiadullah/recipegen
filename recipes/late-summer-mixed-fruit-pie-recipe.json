Add pitted cherries, blueberries, and Cape gooseberries, or whatever mix of fruit you prefer, to bring the total weight to 28 ounces (790g; volume will vary). Toss with sugar, salt, and tapioca starch, folding with a flexible spatula until well combined. Scrape into prepared pie shell and top with remaining dough, as a solid sheet, a\nlattice\n, a\nherringbone\n, or checkerboard. Trim away excess dough and refrigerate to ensure top crust is completely chilled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Egg Wash (if using):\nWhisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled top crust in a thin, even layer. This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen, but is not necessary in any way.\nPlace chilled pie on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crust is golden, about 1 hour, then loosely cover with tented foil. (Alternatively, an empty baking sheet can be placed on topmost rack of oven to serve as a shield.) Continue baking until filling is bubbling even in the very center of the pie, about 15 minutes more. If crust completely covers filling, bake until pie reaches an internal temperature of 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Serve:\nCool pie until center of filling is no warmer than 85\u00b0F (29\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 hours depending on the type of pie plate. (Above that temperature, filling will be runny and thin.) Slice into wedges with a sharp knife, pressing firmly against bottom and sides of pie plate to ensure under-crust is completely cut. Wrapped in foil, leftovers will keep up to 3 days at room temperature; warm 10 minutes in a 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) oven to revive crust before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n9-inch pie plate\n(preferably tempered-glass), pastry brush (if using egg wash),\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nThis recipe works best with fruits similar to those listed in the ingredients, rather than wildcards such as apples, figs, or melons. When mixing things up with a\nvariety of fruits in a pie\n, you have no better partner in the kitchen than a scale\u2014particularly if you want to experiment beyond the suggestions given. If measuring with cups, stick to the listed ingredients, and take care not to pile the fruit too high.\nDue to disparate sourcing practices, tapioca starch manufactured in Asia may be derived from plants other than cassava, which have different gelling properties. Look for products that mention cassava by name on the packaging, such as Bob's Red Mill.\nActive time will fluctuate depending on the complexity of crust design.\nRead More\nButtery, Flaky Pie Crust Recipe\nHow to Bake a Pie With Frozen Fruit\nHow to Freeze and Thaw a Fresh-Fruit Pie\nThe Best Blueberry Pie Recipe\nThe Best Cherry Pie (With Fresh or Frozen Fruit) Recipe\nPies\nPie Dough\nFruit\nSummer"
