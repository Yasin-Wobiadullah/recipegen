In a small saucepan, heat heavy cream over medium heat until simmering. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often to prevent scorching, until cream is reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Whisk in 2 ounces grated parmesan cheese until melted. Cover and set aside.\nIn a medium (roughly 2-quart) baking dish, spread a thin, even layer of polenta. Top with a small amount of the remaining grated Parmesan. Spoon half of the rag\u00f9 on top in an even layer and drizzle with about 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cream.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nGently spread another even layer of polenta on top of rag\u00f9, covering it completely, then top with more grated Parmesan and the rest of the rag\u00f9. Drizzle 2 more tablespoons Parmesan cream on top. Spread a final thin layer of polenta on top, dot with butter and top with more grated Parmesan.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake polenta lasagna until heated throughout and golden on top, about 20 minutes. Let stand until cooled slightly so that the polenta sets a little, about 20 minutes. Reheat remaining Parmesan cream, thinning with a little water if necessary, and serve polenta lasagna, spooning Parmesan cream on top.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nThe exact quantity of polenta and mushroom sauce you need will depend on the size of the baking dish you use; it's possible you may have a small amount of polenta and/or mushroom sauce left over. This recipe calls for a half recipe of the mushroom rag\u00f9, but I recommend making the full batch, since it'll leave you with leftovers that you can freeze for future meals.\nSpecial Equipment\nMedium baking dish (about 2-quart capacity)\nRead More\nMushroom Rag\u00f9\nCreamy Polenta with Chicken, Caramelized Shallots, and Arugula\nGrilled Polenta With Marinara, Parmesan, and Basil\nDinner Tonight: Polenta with Broccoli and Tomato\nSeared Skirt Steak With Blistered Cherry Tomatoes and Polenta\nLasagna\nItalian\nSavory\nCornmeal\nMushrooms",
