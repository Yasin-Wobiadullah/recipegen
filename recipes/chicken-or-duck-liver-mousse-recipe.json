Grind the spices together into a fine powder and pass it through a fine mesh strainer. Set aside.\nCover the onions and pork fat in a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Drain and allow to drip dry for a few minutes.\nPlace the chicken livers, egg, heavy cream, salt, brandy, and spices in a blender and blend on high heat until completely smooth. With the blender running, slowly add the fat and onions. Don't add too quickly or the mixture will break. Blend for at least a minute or two after the last addition of fat. Pass the liquid mixture through a fine mesh strainer.\nPour the liquid into a terrine mold or individual ramekins (a bread pan will do in a pinch) and place them in a roasting pan lined with a kitchen towel. Fill the pan with boiling water to just under the edge of the mold. Cover the top of the mold with a lid (or anything to block moisture from evaporating). Carefully transfer to the middle rack of the oven and back until it reaches 160\u00b0F in the center (about 1 1/2 hours or so).\nRemove from the oven and let it cool completely. Chill overnight in the refrigerator.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Nasty Bits: Pate\nPat\u00e9s & Rillettes\nChicken\nDuck",
