Pat fish dry on paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper. Place flour, egg, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls or plates. Season each gently with salt and pepper. Working one piece at a time, lift fish and dip, presentation-side-down, in the flour, followed by the egg, followed by the breadcrumbs, pressing down firmly until a thick layer of breadcrumbs adheres. Place fish breaded-side-up on a clean plate and repeat with remaining fish.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nHeat oil in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add fish pieces, breaded-side-down and cook, swirling and rotating them around the pan until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip fish and transfer to oven. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the fish registers 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C), about 5 minutes (a knife or a cake tester inserted into the fish should show no resistance). Serve immediately with lemon wedges or tartar sauce.\nSerious Eats / J.
