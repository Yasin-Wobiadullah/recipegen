  "full_text": "DIY Strawberry Liqueur\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n5 mins\nActive\n5 mins\nInfusing Time\n72 hrs\nTotal\n72 hrs 15 mins\nServes\n20 servings\nMakes\n2 1/2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8\nounces\nstrawberries\n, roughly sliced (see notes)\nOne\n3-inch sprig\nfresh tarragon\n1 1/2\ncups\nvodka\n1\ncup\nwater\n1\ncup\nsugar\nDirections\nPlace the strawberries and tarragon in a sealable glass jar, then add vodka. Seal and shake. Let mixture steep for 2 days at room temperature away from direct sunlight. Strain strawberries and tarragon, then filter mixture through a coffee filter or through two layers of cheesecloth, pressing down to extract liquid.\nHeat water and sugar in a pot on medium heat until it boils and forms a syrup, about 5 minutes. Let syrup cool.\nOnce the syrup is cool, combine it with the strawberry-tarragon infusion. Seal in bottle or jar, then shake to mix. Let rest for a minimum of 1 day. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer, cheesecloth or coffee filters\nNotes\nIf you're using frozen strawberries, defrost them before use.\nIf you can't find (or don't like) tarragon, other fresh herbs like basil or mint are good substitutes.\nBe sure to strain thoroughly, as little floating bits of strawberry will give your liqueur an off-flavor after just a week or two.\nRead More\nDIY Cherry Liqueur\nDIY Blackberry Liqueur\nVodka\nStrawberry"
