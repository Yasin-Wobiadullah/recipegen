Cover with at least 3 quarts (2.7L) boiling water and stir to rinse off oil. Drain and rinse with more hot water until pouches no longer feel greasy. Squeeze aburaage to remove any excess liquid. Cut crosswise into 1-inch strips and return to large bowl.\nFor the Dressing:\nIn a small pot, combine Thai green chile, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, lime juice, kala namak or salt, and palm sugar. Over medium heat, warm mixture until sugar dissolves and garlic and ginger begin to wilt. Do not simmer. Pour warm dressing over aburaage and allow it to marinate for about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nToss marinated aburaage and warm dressing with onion, carrot, cucumber, radishes, herbs, and lettuce. Serve salad immediately on its own or with sticky rice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nKala namak\nis a funky, unrefined Himalayan black salt that can add savory notes to vegan dishes. It is an optional addition and can be replaced with an equal amount of kosher salt if desired.\nRead More\nA Guide to Thai-Style Salads\nTurkish-Style Vegan Tofu Scramble (Vegan Menemen)\nSpicy Warm Silken Tofu With Celery and Cilantro Salad\nJicama and Pomelo Salad With Spicy Thai Dressing (Vegan)\nTofu\nVegan Salads\nVegetarian Salads\nNo-Cook Tofu\nCucumbers"
