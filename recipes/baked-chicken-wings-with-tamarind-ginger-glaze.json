Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place it in the oven to preheat as well.\nRemove the stems and seeds from the dried chiles and toast them whole in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant and pliable. In the canister of a blender, combine the toasted chiles, tamarind paste, Thai red chiles, ginger, palm sugar, kosher salt, and 1/2 cup hot water. Set aside to steep until the chiles are softened, about 5 minutes, then blend until smooth.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer the pur\u00e9e\u00a0back to the pan used to toast the chiles and cook over medium heat while constantly stirring with a flexible rubber spatula until the paste is thick, lost much of its moisture, and leaves a streak behind when a spatula is dragged across the bottom of the pot, about 8 minutes.\nIn a large mixing bowl, toss the wings with the chile paste to coat. Spray the preheated baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or brush with oil. Spread the chicken wings on the prepared baking sheet, topping each with some of the chile paste. Bake until sticky and tender, about 45 minutes. Serve right away with raitha.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nSaut\u00e9 pan,\nblender\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nIf you don't have Kashmiri red chiles on hand, feel free to substitute one or a combination of your favorite dried chiles in its place.\nHors D'Oeuvres\nChicken Wings\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nRoasted Chicken\nQuick Snacks",
