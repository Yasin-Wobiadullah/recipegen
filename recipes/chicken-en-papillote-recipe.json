Repeat with remaining packets.\nPlace the packets on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes (see note). Transfer each packet directly to a serving plate and serve, breaking open the packets at the table.\nSpecial equipment\nparchment paper\nThis Recipe Appears In\nChicken Dinners: Chicken en Papillote\nChicken Mains\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nRoasted Chicken\nChicken Breast"
