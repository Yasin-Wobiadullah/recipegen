Place over high heat until steaming-hot, then adjust temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. Combine egg whites, turbinado sugar, salt, cream of tartar, and vanilla seeds in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set over steaming water, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg whites reach 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C). This should take only 10 to 12 minutes, so if mixture seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. Once ready, transfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip at high speed about 10 minutes, until meringue is glossy, stiff, and cool to the touch, around 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C).\nWith mixer still running, add butter, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, followed by coconut oil. Initially, the volume of the meringue will decrease; it may even seem soupy along the way, but as the cool butter is added, the mixture will begin to thicken and cool. In the end, the buttercream should be thick, creamy, and soft but not runny, around 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C). Mix in vanilla extract on low speed until well combined.\nUse buttercream right away, or transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out the air, and seal. Buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks and frozen for up to several months. (The main issue with longer storage in the freezer is odor absorption, not spoilage.) Rewarm to 72\u00b0F and re-whip before using.\nTroubleshooting:\nIf warmer than 74\u00b0F (23\u00b0C), the buttercream will be soft and loose; pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes and re-whip to help it thicken and cool. If colder than 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C), the buttercream will be firm and dense, making it difficult to spread over cakes and slow to melt on the tongue, creating a greasy mouthfeel. To warm, briefly set over a pan of steaming water, just until you see the edges melting slightly, then re-whip to help it soften and warm.

If you don't already have a favorite in mind, I've found Vita Coco to have the most vibrant flavor and aroma. It's available online and in supermarkets nationwide, so keep an eye out for the bright blue label.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make the Ultimate Coconut Layer Cake\nPastries\nCakes",
