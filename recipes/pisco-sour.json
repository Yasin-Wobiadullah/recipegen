Shake vigorously until egg white is foamy, about 10 seconds. Add ice to shaker and shake again very hard until well-chilled, about 10 seconds. Strain into chilled cocktail glass; dash bitters atop the egg-white foam.\nFor simple syrup: In a jar, combine 1 cup water with 1 cup superfine sugar. Seal jar and shake until sugar is completely dissolved. Keep remainder refrigerated.\nSpecial Equipment\nCocktail shaker\n,\ncocktail strainer\nNotes\nMany recipes for pisco sours call for 2, not 3, ounces of pisco. This recipe is based on the stronger versions I was served in Lima, Peru, which typically were made with 3 ounces. If that is too boozy for you, feel free to scale back to 2 ounces.\nBrandy & Cognac\nEgg Whites"
