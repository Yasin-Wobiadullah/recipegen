When you're ready to proceed, strain cream into bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, add sugar and salt, along with almond extract (if using), and whip to soft peaks. This can be done with a hand mixer as well. Enjoy immediately as a garnish for waffles and dessert, or refrigerate up to 1 week in an airtight container. If cream deflates over that time, re-whip before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nNonreactive mesh strainer or cheesecloth,\nhandheld\nor\nstand mixer\nNotes\nDon't think of this as a recipe so much as a rough guideline, as it can easily be adapted to accommodate whatever quantity of pits you have left over from other baking projects. Many pies and jams call for 2 pounds of fruit, leading to my estimation above.\nRead More\nSuper-Thick and Fruity Food Processor Whipped Cream\nCherry Pit Syrup\nLemon Whipped Cream\nDessert Sauces\nGluten-free Desserts\nNo-Cook\nCherry\nHeavy Cream"
