Grease mini loaf cups with butter.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, pumpkin butter, and sugar until well combined. Whisk in eggs and vanilla. Add dry ingredients and stir together just until batter is well combined. Fill each prepared cup 2/3 full with batter. Bake until puffed and golden at the edges and a cake tester inserted into the middle of a loaf comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.\nFor Glaze\n: If serving cakes with glaze, whisk together confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and water until smooth. Spread the top of each cooled cake with glaze. Let stand 20 minutes or until set before moving.\nSpecial Equipment\n3 x 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 mini loaf pan, whisk\nNotes\nPumpkin butters typically come spiced and sweetened and thus will vary by brand. I used Williams Sonoma's version, which is well spiced, medium sweet, and light in texture, though it tastes as much of pumpkin as of spices. If you're using a different brand, taste for sweetness and spices and adjust the spices here accordingly.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nWake and Bake: Pumpkin Butter Tea Cakes with Orange Glaze\nQuick Breads\nGreek Yogurt\nPumpkin\nQuick Breakfast"
