Arrange tomatoes on prepared baking sheet in one layer, season with salt, and drizzle all over with olive oil. Transfer to oven and cook until excess juices have evaporated and tomatoes look slightly dry on the exterior but still moist within, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer oven-roasted tomatoes to a work surface and chop finely.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer to a large mixing bowl. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and basil and stir well. Season with salt and add red wine vinegar, about 1 teaspoon at a time, until tomatoes are very lightly tart. Stir in a pinch of sugar to help pump up tomatoes' natural sweetness even more; add more sugar sparingly to taste, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRub top sides of toasts all over with garlic (rub more on for a stronger flavor, or less for a gentler one). Drizzle toasts with olive oil and season lightly with salt. Spoon tomatoes on top and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nRead More\nFresh Summer Tomato Bruschetta\nPan con Tomate (Spanish-Style Grilled Bread With Tomato)\nSourdough Toasts With Tomato, Pesto, and Burrata\nItalian\nDairy-free Snacks & Appetizers\nVegan Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nTomato",
