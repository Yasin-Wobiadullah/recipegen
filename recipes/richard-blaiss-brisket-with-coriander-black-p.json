Season with coriander, salt, black pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper.\nHeat oil in a roasting pan over medium-high heat until just smoking. Sear brisket, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides. Remove it to a platter to cool, covered, about 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, arrange 2 long overlapping sheets of aluminum foil that are large enough to envelop brisket on a work surface.\nPreheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). In a small bowl, mix brown sugar and mustard to make a paste. Rub brisket with paste and place atop foil sheets, making sure to get every last bit of paste. Tightly wrap brisket in foil so that no mustard paste can escape.\nPlace brisket on roasting rack set in roasting pan and cook for 10 hours. A paring knife should pierce meat with ease. Let cool slightly.\nUnwrap brisket, slice, and serve with mashed potatoes. Leftover brisket can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nBrisket\nDairy-free Mains\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nBeef Mains\nPassover"
