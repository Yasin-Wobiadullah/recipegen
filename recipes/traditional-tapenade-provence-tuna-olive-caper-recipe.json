  "full_text": "Traditional Proven\u00e7al Tapenade With Capers, Anchovies, and Tuna Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nMakes\n1 cup\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nounces\npitted black olives\n(about\n3/4\ncup\n), such as\nNi\u00e7oise\nor\noil-cured olives\n2\nounces\ndrained capers\n(about\n1/3\ncup\n)\n1\nounce\ndrained\noil-packed anchovy fillets\n(about\n8\nfillets\n)\n1\nounce\ndrained oil-packed tuna\n(about\n3\ntablespoons\n)\n2\nloosely packed\nteaspoons\nfresh oregano\n,\nmarjoram\n, or\nthyme\nleaves (optional; see note)\n1/2\nteaspoon\nDijon mustard\n(optional; see note)\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n, as needed\n1\nteaspoon\nCognac\n(optional; see note)\nDirections\nIf using a food processor:\nIn the processor work bowl, combine olives, capers, anchovies, and tuna; add herbs and mustard, if using. Process, scraping down the sides, until a finely chopped paste forms. With the processor running, drizzle in just enough olive oil to loosen to a spreadable paste, about 2 tablespoons. Process in Cognac, if using. Serve.\nIf using a mortar and pestle:\nRoughly chop olives, capers, and anchovies, then add to mortar with tuna. Add herbs and mustard, if using. Tap, crush, and smash with pestle until ingredients have been reduced to a thick paste (a little chunkiness is okay). Using pestle to blend, drizzle in just enough olive oil to form a spreadable paste, about 2 tablespoons. Work in Cognac, if using. Serve.\nNotes\nIf you're pressed for time, use the food processor method; it will yield a uniformly blended olive spread with lots of chopped little bits. If you have the time and inclination, use a mortar and pestle: It takes longer and requires some elbow grease, but you'll be rewarded with superior flavor and texture. The basic ingredients of olives and olive oil, capers, anchovies, and tuna are totally delicious by themselves, but if you like, you can also work in aromatic herbs, Dijon mustard, and even Cognac, all of which are traditional add-ins.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nor\nmortar and pestle\nThis Recipe Appears In\nA Tale of Two Tapenades (and How to Make Them)\nCondiments & Sauces\nFrench\nAnchovies\nTuna\nDips"
