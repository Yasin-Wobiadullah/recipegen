Season the liquid generously with kosher salt and cover the pot to bring it to a boil.\nIn the meantime, peel the garlic and slice it. Place the butter and olive oil in a saut\u00e9 pan large enough to fit the pasta and place it over low heat to slowly melt the butter.\nWhen the water and wine come to a boil, add your spaghetti; stirring as needed to engulf the pasta in the liquid. As the spaghetti cooks, stir it often to prevent it from sticking.\nAdd the garlic to the pan and wait for it to come to a sizzle. Add the optional peperoncino for some heat, if you like and stir the garlic, keeping the heat low to prevent it from scorching\nWhen the garlic is toasted pale and sizzling, add the additional 1\u20442 cup of red wine and a generous splash of the pasta cooking water to the pan and turn up the heat until the liquid simmers.\nTest the spaghetti for doneness; when it is al dente, transfer it to the saut\u00e9 pan along with the parsley. Keep cooking the spaghetti in the juices, tossing and shaking the pan until the liquid is absorbed.\nServe immediately on warm plates. The pasta is delicious without grated cheese, but you can grate a bit of Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top if you like.\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Pasta\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine",
