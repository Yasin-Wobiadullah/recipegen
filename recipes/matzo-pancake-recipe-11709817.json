(Exactly how small is a question of personal preference; you can reduce it all to a rough meal, or leave some larger chunks for a more varied texture.)\nSerious Eats / Joel Russo\nAdd just enough cold water to saturate all the crushed matzo and let stand until softened, about 1 minute. Drain matzo, pressing out excess water, and return to the bowl.\nSerious Eats / Joel Russo\nIn a small mixing bowl, beat eggs with a large pinch of salt. Add eggs to matzo and mix well.\nSerious Eats / Joel Russo\nIn a large nonstick or cast iron skillet, melt 1 tablespoon (15g) butter over medium heat until foaming. Using a soup spoon, dollop matzo batter into pan, forming small oval pancakes. Cook until golden on the first side, about 2 minutes. Turn pancakes and continue cooking until golden on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Continue with remaining matzo batter, using additional butter as needed to keep the pan greased; adjust heat throughout to maintain a gentle but active sizzle.\nSerious Eats / Joel Russo\nTransfer matzo pancakes to a platter and keep warm. Serve with a dish of granulated sugar on the side, for sprinkling on top at the table.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\ncast iron skillet\nor\nnonstick skillet\nRead More\nMatzo Showdown: Manischewitz vs. Yehuda vs. Streit's\nPassover\nRecipes\nSnacks & Appetizers\nBreakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian",
