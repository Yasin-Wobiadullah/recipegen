Spray a 13 by-9 inch pan with nonstick cooking spray.\nWhisk together white rice flour, sugar, sorghum flour, cornstarch, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, salt, and xanthan gum in a large mixing bowl. Add pumpkin, eggs, oil, molasses, and golden syrup. Mix until ingredients are thoroughly combined and a smooth batter forms (use medium speed on a handheld mixer or medium-low speed on a stand mixer. If mixing by hand, use a balloon whisk and mix for 2 minutes). Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl once or twice with a rubber spatula while mixing.\nSpread batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove pan from oven and place on a wire rack. Allow to cool before slicing. Store bread wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature for 3 to 5 days, or wrap and freeze for up to 3 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer or\nwhisk\nNotes\nIf you don't have golden syrup (a cane syrup) in your pantry, you can replace it with molasses, bringing the total molasses in the recipe to 3/4 cup.\nCakes\nGinger\nFall Desserts\nChristmas Desserts"
