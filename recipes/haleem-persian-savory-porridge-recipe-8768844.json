In a large pot, combine lamb, onion, bay leaf, 6 cups of water (1.4 liters), and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Cover and cook, reducing heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer, until the meat is fully tender and falls off the bone easily, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a cutting board and let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Strain the meat stock through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl; Set aside.\nSerious Eats/ Nader Mehravari\nOnce meat is cool enough to handle, use 2 forks or your hands to debone and shred the meat into thin long strands; set aside.\nSerious Eats/Nader Mehravari\nWhile the lamb cooks, in a large Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed stockpot, combine the cracked wheat, 8 cups of water (1.9 liters), and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, partially cover the pot, and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and scorching on the bottom of the pot. Cook until the wheat is softened and mixture is very thick and creamy,\u00a0about 1 1/2 hours, adjusting with additional lamb stock or water as needed to keep grains fully submerged to reach proper consistency.\nSerious Eats/Nader Mehravari\nLadle half of the cooked wheat into a food processor and process until smooth, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats/Nader Mehravari\nPour the processed wheat mixture into a large fine-mesh strainer set over a large mixing bowl. Using a silicone spatula or a flexible dough scraper, push the mixture through the strainer until only the tough pieces of cooked cracked wheat remain. Scrape and clear the underside of the strainer as needed. This process may take up to 10 minutes. Alternatively, you can use a food mill set with a fine disc to process and strain the mixture. Discard the unpassable tough wheat. Repeat processing and straining the remaining cooked wheat (depending on the size of your fine-mesh strainer, you may need to process and strain in more than 2 batches). When done, you should have between 1.5 to 2 quarts (1.4 to 1.9 liters) of a velvety, light cream color, soft paste that has the consistency of mayonnaise. This is referred to as the \u201csyrup of wheat.\u201d\nSerious Eats/Nader Mehravari\nRinse and dry the now-empty heavy-bottomed stock pot that you had cooked the wheat in and transfer the \u201csyrup of wheat\u201d back into the clean pot.\nSerious Eats/Nader Mehravari\nSet 1/4 cup of the shredded lamb aside, then stir the remaining shredded lamb into the cooked wheat in stockpot. Add a 1/2 cup of the reserved meat stock into the mixture. With a wooden spoon or a large silicone spatula, stir to combine. Cook over medium-low heat and while continually stirring, slowly pour in additional meat stock, 1/2 cup at time, until the mixture is a thick creamy consistency, about 15 minutes. Lower the heat as needed so the mixture is steaming hot but not boiling. Add butter and stir until butter is fully melted, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats/Nader Mehravari\nWhile continuing to cook the porridge over low heat, use a handheld mixer on its lowest speed to whip the porridge until the haleem is velvety, stretchy, and elastic with the strands of meat broken down into fine pieces, 10 to 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats/Nader Mehravari\nTransfer the cooked haleem to a large serving bowl or individual bowls and garnish with the reserved shredded meat. Serve with your preferred optional garnishes.\nSerious Eats/Nader Mehravari\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge stockpot, large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, large fine-mesh strainer, food processor, hand-held mixer\nNotes\nIf you can\u2019t find cracked wheat, substitute equal amounts, by weight, of whole wheat berries, pearled wheat, farro, spelt, or pearled barley and increase the cooking time in step 2 by 1 hour.\nVariations of Haleem\nOther\nOptions for Lamb in Haleem\nThe original Persian haleem was made with wheat and lamb. Over the centuries, professional and home cooks have created a wide range of haleems, which are given names that identify the key ingredients. In addition to lamb, haleems are made with beef, turkey, chicken, duck, and goose meat. The best cuts of beef for haleem are chuck, bone-in short rib, shanks, and oxtail. The best cuts of chicken or turkey for haleem is bone-in breasts.\nPreparation of the beef version is practically identical to the lamb version. While obviously not an option for practicing Muslims, versions of haleem are also made with whole pork tenderloin (as it has long muscle fibers) or a large chunk of pork shoulder (the same cut as used for pulled pork dishes).\nIt is believed that introduction of poultry variations was an attempt by home cooks to shorten the cooking process, as typical poultry meat reaches falling-of-the-bone stage sooner than other meat. In fact, turkey haleem is now one of the most frequently seen varieties. The chicken and turkey versions are prepared similar to the lamb version but with a reduced cooking time.\nOther\nOptions for Wheat in Haleem\nIn addition to wheat berries, haleems are made with other types of cereal, legume, or nuts including barley, rice, and lentils. There is an important and popular sub-class of haleems where eggplant is the key ingredient. Some regional varieties may feature pistachios, milk, or fermented dried grains.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe wheat can be cooked, processed, and strained through step 5, and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Once refrigerated it will become a thick gelatinized block. When ready to make the haleem, reheat it gently over medium-low heat in the saucepan that you are going to use to make the haleem while adding water, or extra meat stock from cooking the meat, 1/4 cup of a cup at a time.\nThe lamb can be cooked, deboned, and shredded and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Refrigerate the strained broth in a separate airtight container for up to 4 days as well.\nThe final haleem can be cooled and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat it gently over medium-low heat in a saucepan,\u00a0adding any leftover meat broth or water 1/4 cup at a time to restore it to its original creamy and elastic consistency.\nHaleem\u00a0can also be frozen for up to 2 months. When I have lots of leftovers, I store them in the freezer in individual 1 cup freezer-and-microwave-safe containers. When I want to have a super hearty breakfast, I transfer one of the containers to the refrigerator the day before to defrost and zap it the next morning in the microwave oven while adding a couple of tablespoons of water.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nFarro & Other Wheat\nMiddle Eastern\nRamadan",
