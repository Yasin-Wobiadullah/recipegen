(Ann says 345\u00b0F, but my oven doesn\u2019t do that.) Generously butter a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate or a similar sized cast-iron skillet.\nWhisk together the flour, baking powder and salt, if you\u2019re using it, and keep at hand.\nWorking in a mixing bowl with the whisk, beat the egg(s) and sugar together until thick and pale. Stir in the vanilla, if you\u2019re using it, and then the melted butter. The mixture will be smooth and shiny. Stir in the dry ingredients and scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Top with the apples, making a spiral pattern. Leave some space between each slice, so the batter can puff up between the wedges \u2013 it looks much nicer with the puffs.\nSlide the pan into the oven and bake for about 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack.\nIf you want to glaze the cake, warm a few spoonfuls of jelly and a splash of water in a microwave oven (or a saucepan) until the jelly liquefies. Brush the jelly over the hot cake.\nLet the cake cool for at least 15 minutes, or wait until it reaches room temperature, before you cut it into wedges to serve.\nStoring:\nCooled and covered, the cake will keep overnight at room temperature, but it\u2019s best served shortly after it\u2019s baked.\nCakes\nScandinavian\nBaking\nApple"
