Blend soaked raisins and tomatoes with a hand blender or in a standing blender until nearly smooth. Set aside.\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in pressure cooker (see note) over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring frequently until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add peppers, tomato mixture, chicken stock, and pork. Seal pressure cooker and cook at high pressure for 15 minutes. Release pressure.\nRemove lid from pressure cooker and continue to cook without lid until liquid is reduced to half, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil and flour in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly until light blond in color, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk flour mixture into simmering chili. Continue to cook until desired texture is reached. Season to taste with salt. Cooked chili will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Burger Lab: The Pueblo Slopper (And How To Make Pueblo Green Chili)\nCondiments & Sauces\nPork\nChile Pepper",
