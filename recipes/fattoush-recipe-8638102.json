Spread pita on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, using a wooden spoon or flexible spatula to stir halfway through cooking, until squares are completely dry, toasted, crisp, and beginning to darken in color, about 15 minutes. Let pita cool fully, about 15 minutes. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Dressing:\nIn a small screw-top jar, combine olive oil, lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, garlic, and salt. Tightly seal and shake vigorously until fully combined, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Mai Kakish\nIn a large, wide bowl, combine romaine lettuce, purslane, parsley, mint, scallions, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper, radishes, and the toasted pita. Pour all of the dressing over the vegetables and, with clean hands and wearing gloves if desired, very lightly toss to evenly coat salad with dressing. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to a serving bowl, top with grated halloumi, and sprinkle with the sumac. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nbox grater\nNotes\nIn a pinch, homemade pita chips can be substituted with store-bought pita chips.\nYou can find pomegranate molasses in Middle Eastern grocery stores, well-stocked supermarkets, and online. It\u2019s important to use good quality pomegranate molasses in this dish because it has nowhere to hide. Look for pomegranate molasses where the only ingredient is pomegranates. There should be no sugar, thickeners, or stabilizers, and it should have the texture of runny honey.\u00a0(Pomegranate molasses that\u2019s extremely thick is likely adulterated with some kind of thickener and/or stabilizer.) If you cannot find a bottle, you can always\nmake your own\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce cool, the dried pita can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.\nDressing can be made a day in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container.\nSalads\nThe Latest\nMiddle Eastern\nVegetarian"
