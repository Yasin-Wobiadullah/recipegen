  "full_text": "Ham Hocks and Crowder Peas From 'Down South'\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n4 hrs 50 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n4 hrs 50 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nHam Hocks and Peas:\n2\nsmoked ham hocks\n1\nonion\n, cut into medium dice\n2\nbay leaves\n2\npounds\nshelled\nfresh crowder peas or other\nfield peas\n1\ntablespoon\nplus\n1\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\n1\nteaspoon\nblack pepper\nEasy Pickled Chile Vinegar:\n2\ncups\nsliced\nbanana chiles\n, stemmed but not seeded\n1\ncup\nsliced\nserrano chiles\n, stemmed but not seeded\n3\ncups\ndistilled\u00a0white vinegar\n3/4\ncup\nsugar\n1\nteaspoon\nkosher salt\nDirections\nTo make the broth, combine the hocks, onion, bay leaves, and 3 1/2 quarts water in a medium heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat so that the water simmers.\nCover and cook until the ham hocks are completely tender, about 4 hours.\nMeanwhile, make the chile vinegar: Put the sliced chiles in a 1-quart glass jar. Bring the vinegar, sugar, and salt to a boil in a nonreactive saucepan. Cool briefly and then pour the hot vinegar over the chiles. Cool again for a few minutes, then cover with the lid and refrigerate for up to 3 months.\nWhen the hocks are tender, add the peas, salt, and pepper and cook until the peas are tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Make sure the peas have enough liquid to cover them throughout the cooking process. If the liquid seems to be evaporating too quickly, cover the pot. The liquid should soak up into the beans as they cook; when they are done, the liquid level should be even with the peas. Stir in 3 tablespoons of chile vinegar before serving.\nSides\nStovetop\nHam\nPeas"
