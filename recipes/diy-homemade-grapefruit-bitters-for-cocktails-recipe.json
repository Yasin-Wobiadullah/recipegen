Be sure to purchase cut gentian root and not the powdered variety.\nIf 100-proof vodka is not available where you live, use standard 80-proof vodka.\nI use Ruby Red grapefruit, but you can use your favorite variety.\nTo make simple syrup, combine 1 cup water with 1 cup sugar in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Cool before using. Simple syrup will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\nRead More\nDIY Orange Bitters\nMeyer Lemon Bitters\nKrangostura Bitters\nPaloma Point (Mezcal Negroni With Grapefruit)\n6 Grapefruit Cocktails to Get You Through Winter\nVodka\nGrapefruit",
