Sear the mushrooms and pearl onions until they begin to take on a little color\u2014 your mushrooms will make a delightful \u201csqueak- squeak\u201d as they\u2019re pushed around the hot pan\u2014 but the mushrooms do not yet release any liquid, about 3 or 4 minutes. Remove mushrooms and onions from the pan and set aside.\nLower the flame to medium, and add the second tablespoon of olive oil. Toss the carrot, onion, thyme, a few good pinches of salt, and several grinds of black pepper in the pan, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is lightly browned. Add the garlic, and cook for just 1 more minute. Season with more salt and pepper.\nAdd the wine to the pot, scraping any stuck bits off the bottom, then turn the heat all the way up and reduce it by half, which will take about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and the stock. Add back the mushrooms and pearl onions with any juices that have collected, and bring the mixture to a boil; reduce the temperature so it simmers for 10 to 15 minutes, or until both the mushrooms and onions are very tender.\nCombine the flour and the remaining butter with a fork; stir this into the stew. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Lower the heat, and simmer for 10 more minutes. If the sauce is too thin, boil it down to reduce to a \u201ccoating\u201d consistency. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.\nTo serve, spoon the stew over a bowl of egg noodles, dollop with sour cream, if using, and sprinkle with optional chives or parsley.\nMake-ahead and Storage\nThe mushroom stew reheats very well on the second and third days, in a large saucepan over low heat.\nPasta Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Pasta\nPortobello Mushrooms"
