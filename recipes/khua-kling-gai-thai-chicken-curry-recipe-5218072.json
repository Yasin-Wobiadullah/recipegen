Spread cubed chicken in an even layer on cutting board. Chop chicken, working the knife across the cutting board in a continuous motion, occasionally lifting and folding the meat over on the board to expose larger pieces of meat, until coarsely minced, about 3 minutes. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nHeat wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add oil, swirl to coat, and add curry paste and cook, stirring constantly with a wok spatula, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd chicken and continue to cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the wok constantly to prevent chicken from sticking and curry paste from scorching, until chicken is cooked through and the moisture it has released has fully evaporated (the sound will change from a simmer to a sizzle as the chicken begins to fry in oil once the water has evaporated), about 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd fish sauce and sugar, and continue to cook, stirring and scraping frequently, until fully absorbed, about 30 seconds. Add lemongrass, 3/4 of the makrut lime leaves, and Thai chiles (if using). Stir and toss until thoroughly combined, then remove from heat. Serve immediately with cooked jasmine rice and a Thai omelet.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nCarbon steel wok, wok spatula\nNotes\nMakrut lime leaves can be found at Southeast Asian and South Asian markets. If you\u2019re lucky you will find them fresh, but it is more common to find them frozen (note that they are often sold under a different name that we avoid using, as\nit is a derogatory term in some contexts\n).\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nKhua kling gai is best enjoyed immediately, but leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nMains\nChicken\nChicken Stir-Fry\nThe Latest\nThe Wok\nWhy The Wok?\nEssays & Profiles\nWok Recipes\nWok Skills 101\nWok Skills 102\nThe Wok Gear Guide\nThe Importance of the Wok\nQ&A: Grace Young & Her Woks\nFrom China: The Future of the Wok\nSan Francisco's Iconic Wok Shop\nExcerpt: The Science of Woks\nDim Sum\u2013Style Steamed Pork Ribs\nTofu With Peas and Silky Egg\nSichuan Stir-Fried Potatoes\nChinese Scrambled Eggs With Tomato\nTaiwanese Deep-Fried Squid Balls\nThai Chicken and Curry Stir-Fry\nJapanese Shrimp in Chili Sauce\nStir-Frying\nDeep-Frying\nBraising\nSteaming\nSmoking\nPassing-Through\nEssential Knife Skills for Wok Cooking\nSetting Up a Wok Cooking Station\nHow to Season Your Wok\nHacking Wok Hei at Home\nBest Flat-Bottomed Woks\nThe Best Torches for Wok Hei\nThe Full Wok Accessory Guide\nOutdoor Wok Burners Picks"
