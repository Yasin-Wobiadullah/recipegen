Set aside in the fridge to marinate for at least 15 minutes and as much as an hour \u2013 whatever you have time for.\nWhen chicken is done marinating, remove from the fridge. Pour the oil into a large wok or skillet set over high heat. When just about ready to smoke, add the shallot, chiles, and lemongrass. Stir-fry until very fragrant, about one minute. Add the chicken and red bell pepper. Stir well, and then let the chicken pieces cook undisturbed until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Using a spatula, flip the chicken pieces, and cook until lightly browned on the other side, about another minute.\nPour in the coconut milk and reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the coconut milk has almost completely evaporated, 6 to 8 minutes. The fat in the coconut milk will just start to separate.\nTransfer to a serving plate, and garnish with cilantro. Serve with white rice.\nChicken Thighs",
