  "full_text": "Mediterranean Flavors: White Bean Spread with Za'atar Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n70 mins\nTotal\n90 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\npound\n(\n2\ncups\n) of small dried cannelini or\nGreat Northern beans\n, soaked overnight\n6\ncloves\nof\ngarlic\n, peeled and smashed\n3/4\ncup\nextra virgin olive oil\n2\ntablespoons\nzaatar\nZest of\n2\nfruit (2-3/8\" dia)\nlemons\nJuice\nof\n1 1/2\nlemons\n1/4\nteaspoon\nsugar\n, if needed\nDirections\nBring your beans and the garlic to a boil in a large, heavy pot for a couple minutes, then reduce to a simmer. Half-cover the pot and let the beans cook till very tender. Add salt to taste and let them cool in the pot. If you don\u2019t have time for dried beans, two 15 oz. cans of beans are also fine.\nSet aside 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid (save the rest for another use) and transfer the beans to a food processor and pur\u00e9e. Through the feed tube, slowly pour in the reserved cooking liquid and the olive oil. If using canned beans, use more olive oil, stock, or water.\nAdd the za\u2019atar, lemon zest, and lemon juice, then pulse a few times to combine. Tinker with the salt, acid, and za\u2019atar if needed. If the spread feels like it\u2019s lacking a certain depth of flavor, that tiny pinch of sugar can go a long way.\nTransfer the spread to a bowl and sprinkle on some more za\u2019tar and olive oil. Let the spread cool to room temperature before serving. If you want to save some for later, move it to a smaller container, cover it with a thin layer of olive oil, and store it in the freezer.\nDips\nWhite Beans"
