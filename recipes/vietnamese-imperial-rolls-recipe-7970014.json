Stir in garlic and chile, if using, and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nFor the Filling:\nUsing your hands, squeeze jicama to remove excess liquid. Spread jicama and carrot in an even layer on a paper towel-lined\u00a0 rimmed baking sheet and let air-dry for 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a small bowl, soak cellophane noodles in 2 cups (475ml) warm water for 15 minutes. Drain softened noodles, squeeze noodles dry to remove excess liquid, then cut into roughly 1-inch strands. Return to now-empty bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a separate small bowl, soak wood ear mushrooms in 1 cup (235ml) warm water for 15 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Chop fine, discarding any tough stems.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a large bowl, combine prawns, pork, carrot, jicama, cellophane noodles, wood ear mushrooms, shallot, scallion, garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper. Using your hands, mix until fully combined. To check for seasoning, cook 1 tablespoon of the filling\u00a0in a small pan over medium heat or microwave on a plate for 45 seconds before tasting for seasoning. Adjust uncooked filling to taste with extra sugar or salt if needed.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nTo Form and Fry:\nIn a large shallow wide bowl, stir together 1 1/2 cups (355ml) warm water with the soda.\u00a0 Working with one rice paper wrapper at a time, dip into the liquid until the wrapper is just pliable. Remove and shake off excess water.\u00a0 Lay moistened wrapper on a clean counter or cutting board. Place 1/4 cup filling just below center of rice paper sheet. Using hands, shape filling into a 4\u00a0 1/2-\u00a0 to 5-inch log parallel to counter edge.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFold the left and right sides of the wrapper towards the center to enclose filling snugly. Fold bottom corner of wrapper over filling and press gently along length of filling to remove air pockets. Starting at bottom counter edge, gently wrap up and over the filling to form a tight cylinder and finish rolling to seal. Transfer roll seam side down to a rimmed baking sheet. (Do not stack). Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling; you should have about 14 rolls. Cover filled rolls with a damp towel and refrigerate rolls until ready to fry.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSet wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Line rack with a double layer of paper towels. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Working with 1 at a time, use tongs or spider skimmer to gently transfer 6 rolls to oil and fry rolls until golden brown all over and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes, turning rolls and gently separating rolls with tongs halfway through frying. Adjust burner as needed, to maintain oil temperature of 325\u2109 to 350\u2109 ( 160\u00a0 to 175\u2103) degrees. Transfer fried rolls to prepared rack. Repeat with remaining rolls, frying 6 to 4 at a time. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nFor Serving:\nServe imperial rolls with lettuce, fresh herbs, dipping sauce, pickled daikon and carrots, and pickled leeks, if using, alongside dipping sauce. To eat, wrap each roll in a lettuce leaf, top with herbs and pickles, and dip into sauce.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nVietnamese rice paper wrappers are sold dried. They come in three styles; rice flour mixed with tapioca starch, all tapioca starch, or wrappers made from vermicelli noodles called ch\u1ea3 gi\u00f2 r\u1ebf. All three styles will work with this recipe, so choose the style you prefer. Rice paper wrappers can be found at most Asian grocery stores and online.\nCh\u1ea3 gi\u00f2 r\u1ebf is a frozen, ready-to-use product, and the wrappers are separated by thin sheets of paper so that they do not stick together. The package instructions state that they are ready to roll, but should be kept under a moist towel during prep.\nA mandoline works great for thinly slicing the carrots and jicama before cutting into thin matchsticks.\nTo make smaller and slimmer rolls, you may alternatively use\u00a0just 2 tablespoons filling for each roll to have a total of about 28 imperial rolls per recipe.\nPickled leeks, often labeled \u201cpickled leeks in brine\u201d\u00a0 are available at most Asian supermarkets in the canned section. Their delicate aroma and sweet and sour finish make them a great pairing with these imperial rolls.\nThis recipe can be doubled, or even tripled and fried in several additional batches, 6 to 4 rolls at a time.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe filling can be prepared through Step 5 ahead of time and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day.\nThe dipping sauce can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.\u00a0 If sauce thickens, thin with additional water 1 teaspoon at a time to reach desired consistency.\nUncooked imperial rolls can be frozen in a single layer, and then stacked with sheets of parchment paper between layers, in an airtight container and frozen for up to 1 month. Do not thaw before frying. Increase frying time from frozen by 2 to 3 minutes.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nThe Latest\nFrying\nVietnamese"
