Add sausage and cook until fat renders out and meat is crispy and caramelized on edges. Chinese sausage burns easily, so keep heat no higher than medium.\nRemove fully-cooked sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Increase heat to high. When wok smokes, add snow peas and toss to coat with fat. Stir fry just until snow peas are bright in color with blistered spots, then add rice wine and return sausage to wok. Let wine mostly cook out while stirring to combine, then salt to taste. Transfer to a serving plate and drizzle on sesame oil.\nSpecial Equipment\nCarbon steel wok\nRead More\nSpice Hunting: Sesame Seeds and Oil\nSnow Peas\nChinese\nDairy-free Sides\nVegetable Stir-Fry\nSausages",
