  "full_text": "Pumpkin Sweet Swirl Buns Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nActive\n25 mins\nRising Time\n10 hrs\nTotal\n11 hrs 5 mins\nMakes\n9 rolls\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\n(about\n8\nounces\n)\ncanned pumpkin pur\u00e9e\n(not pie filling)\n1/2\ncup\n(\n4\nounces\n) lukewarm\nwater\n2 1/4\nteaspoons\nactive dry yeast\n1/4\ncup\nsugar\n13 1/2\nounces\n(about\n2 1/2\ncups\n)\nbread flour\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n4\ntablespoons\n(\n1/2\nstick\n)\nunsalted butter\nat room temperature\nNonstick baking spray\n1/4\ncup\nhazelnut meal\n1/4\ncup\nsugar\n1/4\ncup\ngraham cracker crumbs\n2\nteaspoons\ncinnamon\nDirections\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the pumpkin pur\u00e9e, water, yeast, sugar, and bread flour. Knead until the dough becomes smooth and elastic, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the salt and butter and continue kneading until the butter is completely incorporated into the dough, a few minutes longer. Alternatively, knead by hand.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 1 hour. The dough should have visibly risen, but it won't double in size. Flour your work surface and spray a 9-inch square pan with baking spray.\nTurn out the dough and form it into a rough square. With a rolling pin, roll into a rough 10- by 8-inch rectangle.\nIn a small bowl, combine the hazelnut meal, sugar, graham cracker crumbs, and cinnamon. Spread this mixture evenly over the top of the dough, leaving about 1/2 inch uncovered on one of the long sides. Starting from the other long side, roll the dough up loosely, and when you reach the uncovered edge, seal the seam by pinching it together. If there are any sections of the dough that are fatter, roll it gently so the whole roll is approximately the same diameter.\nCut the roll into 9 even pieces. Place the pieces, cut side down, in the pan. The filling is quite loose and will want to come out as you lift the pieces. The easiest way to move them without losing a lot of filling is to flip the pieces onto a large dough scraper and move the to the pan and slide them off. When you've moved all nine pieces to the pan, scoop up any of the filling that's left on the counter and sprinkle it over the buns. Cover the pan with plastic wrap or put it in a large plastic bag and close the bag. Refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours.\nWhen you're ready to bake, remove the pan from the refrigerator and let it rest on the counter while you preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Remove the plastic wrap (or remove the pan from the plastic bag) and bake until the buns are nicely browned, about 40 minutes. If you're not sure if the buns are done, you can take the dough's temperature\u2014it should be about 200\u00b0F, but make sure you're checking the temperature of the dough and not the sugar filling.\nLet the pan cool on a rack. Drizzle the buns with a sugar icing, if desired (powdered sugar and just a bit of water to reach a drizzling consistency).\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer (optional, see note)\nNotes\nYou can knead this dough by hand, but it takes quite a while\u2014a stand mixer makes the job much, much easier.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nRolls & Buns\nPumpkin\nFall"
