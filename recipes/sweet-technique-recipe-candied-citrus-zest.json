  "full_text": "Candied Citrus Zest Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n35 mins\nActive\n45 mins\nCooling Time\n20 mins\nTotal\n60 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\ncitrus fruits\n1\ncup\ngranulated sugar\n1\ncup\nwater\n2\ntablespoons\nlight corn syrup\nDirections\nSet two pots of water (with 1 quart of water in each) to boil over high heat. By the time you\u2019re ready to start blanching, the water will be ready.\nUse a peeler and make long broad strokes from pole to pole of the fruit. Avoid digging into the pith, but don\u2019t fret if you\u2019ve taken a bit as you peel.\nChop the zest into thin strips if desired.\nSet up an ice bath by filling a large bowl three quarters of the way with ice cubes and cold water. Set the bowl near the stove, along with a slotted spoon, spider, or small strainer.\nWhen water comes to a boil, add the zest to Pot #1 and allow it to simmer for 20 seconds. Remove zest from water, either by fishing it out with spider or pouring it through strainer into the sink. Rinse and refill Pot #1 with another quart of water, and return the pot to a boil.\nPlunge the zest into the bath of ice water. It\u2019s helpful to keep the strands inside the strainer in the bath to avoid having to pick the zest out of the ice.\nRepeat steps 5 and 6, first using Pot #2, and then using the newly boiled water in Pot #1. When you\u2019ve finished the third round of blanching, retire Pot #1.\nWhen you\u2019ve finished blanching in Pot #2, you can immediately set up for the final step: candying. Using the ratio of 1 cup fresh water to one cup sugar for every four fruits you\u2019ve zested, combine sugar, corn syrup, and water in Pot #2 and bring it to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.\nOnce all of the sugar has dissolved and syrup is bubbling, reduce heat to a simmer (just a few steady bubbles, as opposed to a rolling boil) and add the blanched zest. Simmer for about twenty minutes, until the zest is completely translucent and curling along edges. The syrup will become thicker and take on some color from peel. Store the zest in the syrup and allow it to cool before using. Refrigerate in a sealed container.\nSpecial Equipment\n2 medium sized saucepans, ice water bath, spider or small strainer\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSweet Technique: How to Make Candied Citrus Zest\nDessert Sauces\nLemon"
