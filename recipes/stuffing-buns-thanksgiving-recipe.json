Knead with the dough hook until the dough is smooth (except, of course, for the herbs, which will make the dough a little bumpy).\nAdd the salt and butter and continue kneading until the butter is completely incorporated. Cover the bowl and set aside until the dough has doubled in size, about 50 minutes.\nWhen the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 350 degrees, sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal, and dust your work surface with flour. Turn the dough out and divide into 24 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and place the finished balls onto the prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until the buns have doubled in size and an indent remains if you press the dough lightly with a fingertip.\nRemove the plastic wrap and bake at 350 degrees until the buns are nicely browned, about 30 minutes. Remove the buns from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.\nRolls & Buns\nSides\nThanksgiving Side Dishes"
