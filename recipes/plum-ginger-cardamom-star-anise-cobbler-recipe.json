Toss plums and ginger with cornstarch in a large bowl till well combined. Dump into 10-inch cast iron or non-stick skillet with sugar, salt, anise, and cardamom. Add 1/4 cup water and place over medium heat until simmering. Reduce heat to maintain slow simmer and cook until you can draw lines in the bottom of the pan with a spoon, about 15 minutes. Remove the star anise and cardamom pods and discard.\nWhisk together flour, salt, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in large bowl. Add the butter, rubbing it into the flour by squeezing into long, flat pieces between your fingertips and thumb. When the mixture looks mealy, add 1/2 cup of buttermilk and stir together with your hands until mixture clumps together into cohesive mass when pressed. If necessary, incorporate up to 2 tablespoons more buttermilk. Be careful not to overknead dough.\nForm two-tablespoon balls with a portion scoop or large spoon and place on top of fruit. Leave 1/2 inch of space between the dough balls. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until biscuits have browned slightly and interiors aren't gooey when poked with a knife, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cobbler rest for at least 30 minutes for the fruit base to set before serving.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Star Anise\nDesserts\nBaked Fruit\nPlum",
