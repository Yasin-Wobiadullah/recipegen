  "full_text": "Easy Panettone\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n35 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nRising Time\n22 hrs\nTotal\n23 hrs 20 mins\nServes\n12\nto 14 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n400\ng\nall-purpose flour\n(divided)\n175\ng\ncultured buttermilk\n, divided\n10\ng\nplus a\npinch\ninstant yeast\n125\ng\negg yolks\n200\ng\ndried cherries\n100\ng\nbourbon\nZest\nof\n1\nlemon\n75\ng\nhazelnuts\n, crushed and toasted\n75\ng\nsugar\n12\ng\nsalt\n150\ng\nbutter\n, cold but softened\n1\negg\nDirections\nFor the Biga\n: The night before you plan to bake, combine 200g flour, 125g buttermilk, and a small pinch of yeast in a medium bowl with your hands until all of the flour and yeast is hydrated and no clumps remain. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 12 to 16 hours. The biga should double in size.\nFor the Soaker\n: At least a day before you plan to bake, combine dried cherries, bourbon and lemon zest. Allow to sit, covered, at room temperature overnight until the fruit absorbs the alcohol. Shake periodically to make sure your cherries hydrate evenly.\nFor the Dough\n: Place remaining 200g flour, all of the biga, egg yolks, remaining 50g buttermilk, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Mix on low speed until dough is fully incorporated and smooth. About 4 minutes.\nWhen the initial mix has come fully together into a smooth ball, add sugar and salt. Continue mixing on slow speed until dough is once again smooth, about 4 minutes.\nWhen dough has once again come together, turn mixer to medium-high speed and knead until dough forms a slightly stiff, but stretchy and elastic ball, about 4 minutes.\nReturn mixer to slow speed and add butter in small pieces. Mix until butter is fully incorporated into dough, scraping down sides of work bowl with a spatula as necessary. When butter is fully incorporated, dough should feel looser, and stretchier than before, but not greasy. About 10 minutes. If dough continues to feel greasy but you can't see any pieces of butter in the bowl, allow dough to continue to mix on slow speed until the oily feel has fully dissipated, up to 5 minutes longer.\nWhen butter is fully incorporated, drain any excess liquid from the soaked cherries. Add cherries and toasted hazelnuts to the dough. Mix on low speed until your dough re-forms into a coherent ball with cherries and nuts evenly distributed throughout.\nUsing a dough spatula, transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface, shape into a ball, and place the ball seam-side down into the panettone mold. If you wish to make smaller panettona, divide dough now into the number of pieces you desire and place into appropriately sized molds. The ball of dough should fill somewhere between a quarter and a third of the mold.\nBeat egg well and brush over the top of the panettone. Lightly but securely cover your filled panettone mold with plastic wrap. Allow to proof in a warm, slightly humid place until the dough fills the mold roughly 2/3 high, 10 to 12 hours.\n1 hour before you plan to bake, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C (325\u00b0F/165\u00b0C for a convection oven). When the panettone has appropriately risen, apply a second coat of egg wash, place it on a rimmed baking sheet, and place in oven.\nBake panettone until the tops are a deep, golden brown, and a pastry tester or knife pushed into the center comes out clean, approximately 45 minutes, rotating the loaf midway through the bake.\nWhen done, allow to cool for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Stored in a plastic bag, panettone will stay moist and fresh for at least 4 days.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n, digital scale, 8-inch disposable panettone mold\nNotes\nThis recipe calls for metric weights for precision and requires the use of a\ngood digital scale\n.\nItalian\nChristmas\nYeast Breads\nDesserts",
