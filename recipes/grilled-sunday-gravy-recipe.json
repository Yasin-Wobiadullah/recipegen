Spread bread crumb mixture evenly over the beef, leaving a 1/2-inch border along the side furthest from you; press and gently pack the stuffing mixture onto beef to keep it in place. Starting from the side nearest to you, roll up meat like a jelly roll, pressing any stuffing that falls out of the ends back into roll. Tie beef tightly with twine, spacing ties evenly about every 1 1/2 inches. Season outside with salt and pepper all over, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to grill.\nTo make the meatballs:\nIn a large bowl, mix together chuck, pork, bread crumbs, eggs, Parmesan, Pecorino, garlic, parsley, and red pepper flakes until thoroughly combined.
