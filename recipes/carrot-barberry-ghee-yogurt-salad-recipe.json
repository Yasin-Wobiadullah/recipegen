Trim carrot tops, leaving only 1 inch attached on each. Using a vegetable peeler, peel carrots lengthwise to create long strips. Cover strips with a damp kitchen towel and set aside. Once most of each carrot has been peeled and only a slender core remains, split remaining carrot in half lengthwise. Repeat with the rest of the carrot cores and set aside in a shallow dish, along with half of dill.\nIn a small pot, combine 3/4 cup (170ml) water, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil and pour over carrot pieces. Set aside to pickle at least 1 hour at room temperature and up to overnight in the fridge.\nJust before serving the salad, melt ghee or butter in a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, bay leaf, and star anise and toast until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove spices and add barberries to the hot fat. Transfer hot fat and barberries to a large bowl. Stir in yogurt and 2 tablespoons pickling liquid and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nGently toss carrot strips in the dressing. Drain pickled carrots and chop remaining dill, then fold both into the salad. Serve right away.\nNotes\nBarberries are small dried berries that are tart and barely sweet, much like unsweetened cranberries. If you can't find them, unsweetened dried cranberries or chopped unsweetened dried cherries can be substituted.\nSpecial Equipment\nVegetable peeler\n, mixing bowl\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe carrot strips and pickled carrots can be prepped up to 24 hours in advance.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCarrot Salad Gets a Makeover With a Shave and a Pickle\nCarrots\nVegetarian Salads\nVegetarian Sides\nDill\nVegetable Sides",
