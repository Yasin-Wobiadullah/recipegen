Meanwhile, cut out the stem end of each tomato, then score the skin of each tomato, making an X at the top of each one. Carefully lower tomatoes into boiling water and let stand until skins show the first signs of loosening around the edges of the score marks. Using a slotted spoon, transfer tomatoes to ice water and let cool; their skins should loosen even more.\nPull off tomato skins and discard. Cut tomatoes into quarters lengthwise, then scoop out seeds and discard. Dice tomato flesh.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer diced tomatoes to a mesh strainer set over a mixing bowl and sprinkle liberally all over with salt. Let stand to drain at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Discard collected liquids.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer salted tomatoes to a tall container and blend with an immersion blender until a smooth pur\u00e9e\u00a0forms. Alternatively, blend them to a smooth pur\u00e9e\u00a0in a standing blender. If you want an even smoother pur\u00e9e, pass the blended tomato pur\u00e9e\u00a0through a fine-mesh strainer. Adjust seasoning with more salt if required (you probably will not need to add more salt). Use as desired, or freeze for up to 6 months.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\n,\nblender\nor\nimmersion blender\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe pur\u00e9e can be frozen for up to 6 months.\nRead More\nQuick-Cooked Tomato Puree (Passata di Pomodoro) Recipe\nSpaghetti al Pomodoro Crudo (Spaghetti With No-Cook Raw Tomato Sauce) Recipe\nHow the Science of Salt Can Improve Your Tomatoes\nTomato Sauces\nVegan\nNo-Cook\nTomato\nSummer"
