Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season to taste with salt.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Salad:\nPlace trevisano in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle half the vinaigrette into bowl, coating sides rather than pouring vinaigrette directly over the leaves. Using clean hands, toss salad to coat, adding more vinaigrette as needed until trevisano is thoroughly coated but not dripping. Season to taste with salt. Transfer half the leaves to a large serving bowl.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPush remaining trevisano leaves to the side of mixing bowl; then add satsuma segments and parsley leaves to the bowl. Using your hands, gently toss to lightly coat with residual vinaigrette in the bowl, adding more vinaigrette if needed. Scatter half the satsuma segments and parsley leaves over the trevisano in the serving bowl, followed by half of the pistachios, tarragon, and ricotta salata.\nRepeat this layering process with remaining salad components. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk\nNotes\nIf you can't find satsumas, substitute with another type of mandarin/clementine.\nIf you can't find trevisano or conventional radicchio, red endive will work for this salad as well.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nVinaigrette can be refrigerated for up to three days; bring to room temperature and whisk to recombine before using. The salad is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nRadicchio, Endive, and Anchovy Salad\nFennel and Radicchio Salad With Tangerine Vinaigrette\n5-Minute Radicchio and Watercress Salad\nWinter Greens Salad With Fennel, Citrus, and Creamy Citrus Vinaigrette\nWinter Green Salad With Walnuts, Apples, and Parmesan-Anchovy Dressing\nVeneto-Style Radicchio Risotto With Walnuts and Blue Cheese\nSalads\nVegetarian\nGluten-free\nVegetarian Salads\nWinter"
