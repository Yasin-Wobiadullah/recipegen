Cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Drain bones in sink, then rinse under cold running water. Return to pot, add ginger, garlic, onion, and 6 scallions. Cover with water, bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook for 1 hour, skimming off scum and fat occasionally. Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a large pot. Discard solids. You should have about 1 1/2 quarts broth. If not, reduce to 1 1/2 quarts.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nCombine 2 teaspoons cornstarch with 2 teaspoons water in a small bowl and mix with a fork. Add to broth. Add soy sauce and sesame oil. Bring to a boil, season to taste with salt and pepper, and keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor the Garnish\n: Meanwhile, place wood-ears and daylilies in separate bowls, cover with warm water, and let soak at least 30 minutes. Drain carefully, then thinly slice wood-ears and cut daylilies crosswise into 2-inch pieces.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nWhen broth is ready, add sliced wood-ears, daylilies, tofu, and pork. Beat together egg with 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch. Bring broth to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and slowly pour the egg into the broth in a thin steady stream. Let egg set for 15 seconds, then stir gently to incorporate. Season soup to taste with salt if necessary.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nTo Serve:\nJust before serving, stir in white pepper and vinegar. Drizzle with sesame oil and sprinkle with scallions and cilantro. Serve immediately, passing more white pepper, vinegar, and sesame oil at the table to adjust for taste.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nNotes\nFor a much faster version, use 1 1/2 quarts store-bought low-sodium chicken broth simmered with a 2-inch knob of ginger (sliced), 6 scallions, and 4 smashed coves of garlic simmered on the stovetop for 20 minutes in place of the homemade stock. Proceed from Step 2 as directed.\nJinhua ham is a Chinese-style smoked raw ham. You can use country ham, prosciutto, or even a smoked ham hock or bacon in its place. Wood-ear mushroom is sold as black fungus and can be found in Asian market, along with dried daylilies. Chinkiang vinegar is also sold as Zhenjiang vinegar in Asian markets. If unavailable, substitute with two tablespoons red wine vinegar and two tablespoons apple cider vinegar.\nChinese\nStovetop\nChicken\nPork\nTofu"
