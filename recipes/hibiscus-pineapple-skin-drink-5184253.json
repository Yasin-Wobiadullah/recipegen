Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to a simmer, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until pineapple skins are softened and slightly translucent, 40 to 45 minutes. Taste, and adjust sweetness with more sugar as desired.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd zobo (hibiscus) flowers, and stir to combine. Remove pot from heat, and allow liquid to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth, and set over a large container. Once liquid is cooled, strain through prepared strainer in batches, gathering cheesecloth into a bundle and squeezing out as much liquid as possible; discard solids between rounds of straining. Transfer to airtight containers and refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve over ice, garnishing with lime wedges and mint or basil leaves.\nVicky Wasik\nNotes\nThe sweetness of the drink is meant to be adjusted to taste and to account for variation in the sweetness of pineapples. Start with 2 1/3 ounces (65g) sugar, and adjust as needed with more sugar at the end of step 1.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe finished drink can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days, and frozen for up to 3 months.\nPineapple\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nTeas\nWest African\nThe Latest"
