Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nMandoline\n(see notes)\nNotes\nThis recipe is easiest to produce with a mandoline-style slicer, though you can also finely shred the cabbage by hand. To slice cabbages on a mandoline, split the head in half, cut out the core using the tip of a sharp chef's knife, then quarter the cabbage and slice it with the mandoline set to 1/16 of an inch.\nWhen grating the carrot, make sure to hold at a steep vertical bias so that the shreds are long instead of short.\nRead More\nSuper-Simple Tangy Buttermilk Coleslaw Recipe\nColeslaw With Creamy Chili Vinaigrette\nHot Slaw Dogs\nColeslaw\nLabor Day\nCabbage\nVegetable Sides\nMemorial Day"
