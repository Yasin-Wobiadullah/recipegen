If using, spread 1 teaspoon mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread. Divide cheese in an even layer among 2 bread slices (cheese should measure about 1/4-inch thick). Then, top with the remaining bread slices, mayonnaise side down.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nUse a serrated knife to neatly cut off crusts of bread to form a uniform square.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn a shallow bowl, whisk eggs and Pecorino together to combine. In a second shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs, salt, and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nWorking with 1 sandwich at a time, dip each sandwich on all sides in the egg mixture, letting excess egg drip back into bowl, then coat in the bread crumb mixture, making sure the entire sandwich is evenly coated with bread crumbs. Transfer the sandwich to a plate and repeat the dredging process with the remaining sandwich. Refrigerate sandwiches while oil is heating, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nLine a large plate with paper towels; set aside. In a 10-inch cast iron skillet or Dutch oven, add oil until it measures 1 inch deep and heat over medium-high heat to 325\u00baF (160\u00baC). Using a spatula or spider skimmer, carefully transfer both sandwiches to the hot oil and fry until deep golden brown on the bottom, adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature between 300 to 325\u00baF, about 2 minutes. Use 2 spatulas or tongs to flip sandwiches and continue to fry until deep golden brown on the second side, about 2 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nTransfer sandwiches to the prepared paper towel-lined plate and let sit for 90 seconds. Transfer to a cutting board and use a serrated knife to cut halfway through the bread, stopping right before you hit the cheese. Flip the sandwich over and again cut through bread, stopping before slicing through the cheese. Slowly pull sandwich halves apart for an impressive cheese pull.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch cast iron skillet or Dutch oven\nNotes\nIf using fresh mozzarella, the cheese should be firm and when squeezed milk should not ooze from the cheese. If it\u2019s too soft when purchased, refrigerate the cheese for a day or two until firm.\nSandwiches\nItalian\nFrying\nMozzarella",
