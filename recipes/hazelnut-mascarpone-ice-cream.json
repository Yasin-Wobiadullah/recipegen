Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring from time to time, then cover, and cool to room temperature off heat. Once cool, refrigerate overnight, or up to 36 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReturn the chilled hazelnut-milk to a simmer, then strain through a mesh sieve into a large bowl. The hazelnuts can be used as-is to make creamy or crunchy\nhomemade Nutella\n(see notes), but will not be used further in this recipe.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLet the 3-quart saucier cool until safe to touch (no need to wash), then add the sugar, egg yolks, and salt, along with the reserved vanilla seeds (if using), and whisk to combine. When smooth, add the warm hazelnut-milk, followed by the mascarpone, whisking gently to combine.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCook over medium-low heat, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible, heat resistant spatula until warm to the touch, then increase heat to medium. Continue stirring and scraping until thickened and steaming hot, or around 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) although precision is not required in a recipe like this.\nStrain the ice cream base into a non-reactive container, then whisk in vanilla extract or a nutty liqueur. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 39\u00b0F, (4\u00b0C) or cool to the same temperature in an ice bath; the time required will vary considerably depending on the technique, as well as the container style.\nOnce cool, churn the base in an ice cream maker until thick, with a texture like soft-serve. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer. When ice cream looks thick and light, shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape ice cream into the prepared container. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until firm. In an airtight container, with the surface of the ice cream protected by a sheet of plastic, the ice cream will keep for up to 1 month in the freezer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n,\nnon-reactive sieve\n, stainless steel mixing bowl,\nice cream maker,\nnon-reactive, freezer-safe container\nNotes\nThe milk-soaked hazelnuts can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one week, and used, as-is, to make creamy or crunchy homemade Nutella, without any further modification. The cooking phase will take slightly longer to drive out the moisture absorbed by the hazelnuts, but otherwise no changes to the recipe are required. The flavor will be less intensely nutty, but still quite good. In turn, the homemade Nutella can be folded with the finished ice cream, to create a swirl, or else it can be used as a warm topping.\nI flavor the ice cream with a shot of Frangelico, but any nutty or complementary flavor of liqueur will do, or simply use an equal amount of a good vanilla extract (but the flavor will be different).\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nIn an airtight container, with the surface of the ice cream protected by a sheet of plastic, the ice cream will keep for up to one month in the freezer.\nIce Cream\nMascarpone\nHeavy Cream\nHazelnuts\nSummer Desserts",
