Let batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, for best results, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate batter overnight or for up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while you preheat the oven.\nAdjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Divide bacon evenly between two 7-inch or one 10-inch cast iron or oven-safe non-stick skillets. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until bacon is crisp and browned, about 8 minutes. Pour batter into skillet(s) and immediately transfer to the oven. Bake until puffed and deep brown and crisped all over, 20 to 25 minutes, sprinkling edges and center with cheese for last 5 minutes if using.\nSeveral minutes before puddings come out of the oven, fry remaining 4 eggs in butter over medium heat until desired texture is reached. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve Yorkshire puddings immediately with eggs placed inside, sprinkled with chives, and topped with Hollandaise (if using).\nSpecial equipment\nOne (10-inch) or two (7-inch) oven-safe cast iron or enameled cast iron pans, plus another non-stick skillet for frying eggs\nNotes\nFor best results, make batter at least one night in advance and up to three. Store covered in the refrigerator until ready to bake. Crumbled breakfast sausage or mushrooms and onions saut\u00e9ed in butter can be used in place of bacon.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nEggy Puds: The Breakfast Dish You Didn't Know You Need\nBreakfast & Brunch\nEggs\nBacon\nEaster\nMother's Day"
