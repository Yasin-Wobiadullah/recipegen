Add olive oil, basil, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Stir well and season with salt to taste. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a pot of\nlightly salted boiling water\n, cook spaghetti, stirring frequently, until al dente. When pasta has almost finished cooking, transfer 1/4 cup (30ml) pasta cooking water to tomato mixture and whisk to form an emulsion.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing tongs, transfer pasta to tomato mixture along with an additional 1/4 cup (60ml) pasta cooking water. Vigorously toss and stir pasta to emulsify sauce and coat noodles. Add half of the breadcrumbs and toss to combine. The pasta should be well coated with creamy, emulsified sauce. If it seems dry, add extra pasta water and olive oil, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency. Taste for seasoning.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer pasta to warmed plates and sprinkle with remaining breadcrumbs. Top with cheese, if desired. Serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nBox grater\n,\ntongs\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis sauce is best made fresh, and the pasta is best enjoyed right away.\nRead More\nThe Best Fresh Tomato Sauce\nSouthern European\nItalian\nSpaghetti, Bucatini, & Linguine\nTomato Sauces\nQuick Dinners",
