  "full_text": "Water Ganache\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n30 mins\nSetting Time\n9 hrs\nTotal\n9 hrs 50 mins\nServes\n36\nMakes\n108 truffles\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the Ganache:\n1 1/2\ncups\n(\n355\nml\n)\nwater\nPinch\nkosher salt\n1\nteaspoon\nlight corn syrup\n(optional), see notes\n20\nounces\ndark chocolate\n(\n567\ng\n), 60 to 70% cacao, finely chopped (see notes)\nFor the Truffles:\n10\nounces\ndark chocolate\n(\n283\ng\n), 60 to 70% cacao, finely chopped\n12\nounces\nunsweetened cocoa powder\n, sifted (\n340\ng\n;\n4\ncups\n)\nDirections\nLine a 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment; set aside.\nIn a medium saucepan, bring water, salt, and corn syrup (if using) to a boil. Remove from heat, add chocolate, and whisk until smooth, thick, and glossy. Set aside, using a flexible spatula to stir gently and frequently, until ganache registers 94\u00baF (34\u00baC), about 20 minutes. If using ganache to frost a cake, use immediately. If using ganache to make truffles, scrape ganache into prepared baking sheet; press plastic wrap or parchment against surface of chocolate and let sit at cool room temperature until ganache is set, at least 8 hours and up to 48 hours. (See notes.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Truffles:\nUsing a fine-mesh sieve, sift cocoa powder onto a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet.\nBring a medium saucepan to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low to keep water at a bare simmer. Place chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl, set it over the saucepan and, stirring occasionally with a flexible heatproof spatula, cook until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove bowl and set on a heatproof work surface, stirring occasionally, until cooled but still fluid.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile: Using an offset spatula or butter knife, cut ganache into 12 rows lengthwise and then 9 crosswise to form 108 evenly sized squares: . (See notes.) Using your hands and working one at a time, roll each square into a round ball. Set balls aside in a large bowl, on a large plate, or a 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet while you shape the remaining truffle balls.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWorking one at a time, drop truffle into bowl of melted chocolate and, using a slotted spoon or spatula, toss truffle to evenly coat with chocolate. Use slotted spoon to remove truffle, allowing any excess chocolate to drip off, and place in cocoa powder. Gently shake baking sheet after each addition to roll truffles so they are evenly coated with cocoa powder; let sit at cool room temperature until firm, about 1 hour. Repeat with remaining truffles.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen truffles have solidified, place 5 to 7 truffles in a large fine-mesh sieve. Shake to remove excess cocoa; set aside. Repeat with remaining truffles.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet, fine-mesh sieve, 13- by 18-inch\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\nflexible heatproof spatula\nVariations\nTruffles can be rolled in crushed nuts, crushed peppermint candy, cocoa nibs, or coconut instead of cocoa powder.\nNotes\nCorn syrup will give the ganache a nice sheen, but isn\u2019t necessary.\nIf using ganache to glaze a cake, use immediately.\nThis recipe yields 108 one-inch truffles, which is a lot. You can make the full batch of ganache and use half for glazing a cake and refrigerate the rest to make truffles. Leftover ganache can also be reheated to use to glaze cakes or cupcakes or melted in milk to make hot chocolate.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nCoated truffles can be stored in an airtight container at cool room temperature for up to 5 days.\nTruffles can also be frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months.\nChocolate\nThe Latest\nGluten-free Desserts\nDesserts\nDairy-free"
