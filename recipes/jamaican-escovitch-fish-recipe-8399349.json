Pat dry. Using a sharp knife, score the skin side of the fish by cutting a series of diagonal slashes through the skin. Rub garlic all over, then season lightly with salt and pepper, including inside the fish cavity if using whole fish.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nSpread flour in a wide, shallow dish. Dredge fish lightly by dipping both sides into flour and then shaking off excess.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nIn a large cast iron skillet or stainless-steel saut\u00e8 pan, heat 1/2 inch oil over medium heat until melted and shimmering. Gently add fish, skin side down, and fry until golden brown on first side, 3 to 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nCarefully flip fish and cook until second side is golden brown and flesh is opaque and flaky, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted fish spatula, carefully lift fish from oil and transfer to paper towel-lined plate to drain.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nFor the Escovitch Sauce:\nIn a 2-quart saucepan, bring vinegar, 1 cup (237ml) water, sugar, and salt\u00a0 to a boil over medium heat. Add chayote, carrots, onions, Scotch bonnet, and allspice berries, then return to simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nTransfer fried fish to a rimmed heatproof platter or serving dish. Pour hot escovitch sauce over fried fish. Serve hot or let cool to room temperature before serving.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet or stainless-steel saut\u00e8 pan\nNotes\nChayote is a type of squash that is native to Mexico, but popular in Jamaican cuisine. The fruit is a member of the gourd family and it looks like a large pear, with a more wrinkly bottom. Look for a chayote squash that is even in color, firm, free of blemishes, and on the smaller side.\nNowadays, Escovitch fish is often served with fried bammy, a local cassava flatbread inherited from our Taino heritage.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe escovitch pickle can be stored for up to 7 days in the fridge.\nSnapper\nThe Latest\nFried Seafood\nJamaican\nFish"
