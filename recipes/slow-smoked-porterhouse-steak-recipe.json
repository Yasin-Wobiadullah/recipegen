  "full_text": "Slow-Smoked Porterhouse Steaks Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n2 hrs 5 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 20 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nwhole\nporterhouse steaks\n, at least 1 1/2 inches thick (\n30 to 40\nounces\neach; see notes)\nKosher salt\nand freshly ground black pepper\n8\nchunks\nhickory or\nmesquite hardwood\nDirections\nSeason steaks generously with salt and pepper on all sides, including edges. Stack steaks on a wooden cutting board, then insert 3 or 4 metal skewers through both steaks to secure them. Turn them on their sides, and spread them out on the skewers. They should stand on their edges without falling.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nLight 8 coals using a chimney starter. Place all the way on one edge of the coal grate in a charcoal grill. Alternatively, set one set of burners on a gas grill to low. Place 2 wood chunks on top of coals, add cooking grate, and place steaks on cooking grate with tenderloins facing upwards and bones pointing towards the coals (see photograph).\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nCover grill and set top and bottom vents to 3/4 closed. Position top vents over steaks. Cook, adding up to 8 more coals and remaining wood chunks to keep temperature under the grill at around 175 to 200\u00b0F (79 to 93\u00b0C). Monitor internal temperature of the steaks regularly and cook until steaks register 110 to 115\u00b0F (43 to 46\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) for medium, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
