  "full_text": "Mofongo\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n30 mins\nTotal\n55 mins\nServes\n4\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4 cups (\n960\nml\n)\nchicken broth\n2\ngreen onions\n(\n34\ng\n), roughly chopped\n2\nsprigs\nof culantro or\ncilantro\n(see notes)\n1\nbay leaf\n12\nlarge\ngarlic\ncloves\n, peeled and lightly crushed, divided\n2\ntablespoons\n(28g)\nunsalted butter\n4 cups (\n960\nml\n) neutral cooking oil such as canola or\nvegetable oil\n4\nlarge\ngreen plantains\n(833g)\n3\ncups\n(93g)\npork rinds\n, divided, plus more for serving\nKosher salt\n, to taste\nDirections\nIn a small saucepan, bring the chicken broth, green onion, culantro or cilantro, bay leaf, 4 garlic cloves, and butter to a simmer over medium heat. Once simmering, remove from the heat, cover, and set aside to keep warm while frying the plantains.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor Frying the Plantains:\nIn a Dutch oven or large pot (about 10-inches in diameter), heat oil over medium-high heat until oil reaches 350\u00baF (175\u2103). While oil is heating, peel the plantains by cutting off the ends and carefully cutting a slit down each side of each plantain. Remove the skin, then cut the fruit into 2-inch chunks crosswise.\nWhen oil reaches 350\u00baF(175\u2103), add half of the plantain chunks, and fry, adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature around 350\u00baF, until golden and fork tender, 7 to 8 minutes. The plantains will start floating once they are almost finished frying. Use a spider skimmer or large slotted spoon to transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined large plate. Cover with aluminum foil and set aside. Return oil to 350\u00baF and repeat frying the remaining plantains.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor Preparing 1 Serving of Mofongo:\nOnce plantains are fried,\nin a pil\u00f3n or mortar and pestle, smash 2 garlic cloves with a large pinch of kosher salt and 1/4 of the pork rinds (about 3/4 cup). This will be the seasoning base for one serving. (If you don't have a pil\u00f3n or mortar and pestle, see notes for how to prepare the base and the rest of the dish.)\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nAdd 1/4 of the fried plantain chunks (the equivalent to 1 plantain) to the smashed garlic and pork rind mixture in the pil\u00f3n and mash until mixture is well combined and has the texture of chunky mashed potatoes. If the plantain mixture starts to feel dry and is not cohesive, add a couple tablespoons of the warm chicken broth as needed. Season with salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nOnce well mashed, press the mofongo into the rounded well of the pil\u00f3n. Use a flexible spatula to flatten, then gently loosen the mound of mofongo along the edges. Invert the pil\u00f3n onto a shallow individual serving bowl or plate. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil to keep warm while preparing the remaining servings.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nRepeat steps 3 through 5 for the remaining servings.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nTo serve, rewarm the chicken broth over low heat, remove the solids, then ladle the seasoned broth over the mofongo or serve in a bowl on the side. Serve mofongo with additional crushed pork rinds.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant read thermometer, pil\u00f3n or mortar and pestle, flexible spatula. If neither pil\u00f3n nor mortar and pestle is available, a mixing bowl and potato masher are suitable substitutes. If using a mixing bowl and potato masher please see the notes below regarding the garlic and pork rind mixture.\nNotes\nThe chicken broth is seasoned with culantro, a more flavorful cousin of cilantro. It\u2019s also known as recao or sawtooth herb and can be found in many international markets. If you aren\u2019t able to find culantro, cilantro is the best substitute.\nDon\u2019t have a pil\u00f3n or mortar and pestle? No worries. Put those knife skills to work to mince your garlic as much as you can or grate it on a microplane for ease. And keep things mess-free by smashing the pork cracklings in a plastic freezer bag with a large spoon or rolling pin. Then mash mixture in a mixing bowl with a potato masher.\nFor a meat-free version, simply omit the pork cracklings and substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth. To make it vegan,\u00a0use a plant-based butter in place of the regular butter.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best made fresh to order and doesn't reheat well.\nPuerto Rican\nThe Latest\nPlantains"
