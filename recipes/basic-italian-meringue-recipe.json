  "full_text": "Basic Italian Meringue\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nTotal\n20 mins\nServes\n8 (1/2 cup) servings\nMakes\n4 cups meringue\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nsugar\n(\n7\nounces\n;\n200\ng\n)\n1/2\ncup\nwater\n4\nlarge\negg whites\n, at room temperature and preferably from fresh eggs (see note)\n1/2\nteaspoon\ncream of tartar\n(or\n1\nteaspoon\nlemon juice\nor\ndistilled white vinegar)\nDirections\nIn a small saucepan, combine sugar and water. Heat over high heat, stirring only until it comes to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, stop stirring. Cook until sugar syrup registers 240\u00b0F (116\u00b0C) on an instant-read or candy thermometer. Brush down sides of pot as necessary with a pastry brush dipped in water.\nSerious Eats / Marissa Sertich Velie\nMeanwhile, combine egg whites and cream of tartar or lemon juice in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (see note). Set mixer to medium speed and mix until soft peaks form (when lifted, the head of the mixer should form gentle peaks in the egg whites that very slowly collapse back into themselves), about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Marissa Sertich Velie\nWith the mixer running, carefully and slowly drizzle in hot sugar syrup. Hot sugar is just as dangerous as fryer oil, so use caution! Increase speed to high and whip until desired stiffness is achieved. Soft peaks are often used to aerate mousses, for example, while a stiff peak is best for buttercream.\nSerious Eats / Marissa Sertich Velie\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\nor\nhand mixer\n, small heavy-bottomed\nsaucepan\n,\ninstant-read or candy thermometer\nNotes\nFor best results, use fresh eggs at room temperature.\nTo clean out the pot you used to cook the sugar, fill it with water and bring it to a boil. This should dissolve any sugar that's hardened in the pan.\nRead More\nHow to Make Italian Buttercream\nMaple Frosting (Italian Buttercream) Recipe\nMeringue Cookies Recipe\n\u00cele Flottante (Floating Island) Recipe\nExtra Large, Cage-Free, and More: How to Shop for Eggs\nDesserts\nEgg Whites",
