Alternatively, beat with a wooden spoon in a bowl until creamy and aerated. Add orange zest and salt. Next add sugar and flour, stirring until just combined. Finally, stir in nuts. The dough should hold together but still be dry. Form cookie dough into 2- by 12-inch log and wrap tightly in plastic wrap or parchment paper. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\nWhen ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper and lower-middle positions, preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C), and line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice the cookie dough into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange on baking sheets, leaving 1-inch between cookies. Bake until the edges are light golden brown, rotating baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, 10 to 12 minutes total. Let cool slightly and serve. Fully cooled cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n, 2\nrimmed baking sheets\nNotes\nPecans can be used in place of the wild hickory nuts.\nCookies\nBaking\nNuts & Seeds"
