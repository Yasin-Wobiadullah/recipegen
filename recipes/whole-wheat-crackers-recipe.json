Combine whole wheat flour, sugar, wheat germ, salt, cream of tartar, baking powder, and baking soda in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add butter and process until the mix looks floury and fine, with no visible chunks of butter, then add buttermilk and pulse only until the dough comes together in a ball.\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured surface and, using as much flour as needed along the way, roll until just shy of 1/4 inch thick. Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush and loosen dough from counter with an offset spatula. Create steam vents with a fork, bamboo skewer, or docking tool, then cut dough into 2 1/4\u2013inch rounds and transfer to parchment-lined half sheet pans. Gather up scraps, knead, roll, dock, and cut as before.\nBake crackers until firm to the touch and pale gold around the edges, about 25 minutes. Cool directly on baking sheets and serve at room temperature (the crackers will not be crisp while warm). Store leftovers in an airtight container up to 1 month at room temperature.\nSpecial equipment\nFood processor\n, flexible spatula, rolling pin, pastry brush, offset spatula, docking tool (optional), ruler, 2 1/4\u2013inch round cookie cutter, half sheet pans\nNotes\nIf buttermilk's hard to come by where you live, plain kefir works well, but avoid\ncommon buttermilk substitutions\n, like a combination of milk and lemon juice, which won't taste or behave the same way in this dough.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Bring Carr's Whole Wheat Crackers Home\nSnacks & Appetizers\nSavory\nChristmas Appetizers",
