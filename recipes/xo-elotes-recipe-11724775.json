Using a flexible spatula, stir together until homogenous; set aside.\nWhen grill is hot, place corn directly over hot side of grill and cook, rotating occasionally, until cooked through and charred in spots on all sides, about 8 minutes total.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer corn to bowl with cheese mixture and use a large spoon to evenly coat corn on all sides with mixture. Sprinkle with extra cheese and ground chiles (if using) and serve immediately with lime wedges.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nCharcoal grill\nor gas grill,\nchimney starter\nNotes\nXO sauce packs a healthy amount of spicy background heat on its own, but an extra pinch of ground dried chilies will give the mayonnaise mixture more punch. Adjust the heat level of the sauce to your liking.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately. The mayonnaise mixture can be made ahead, and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.\nRead More\nHow to Make XO Sauce, the Cook\u2019s Condiment\nCorn\nRecipes\nGrilling\nSummer",
