Aim for around one and a half chops per person, or two chops per person if you want leftovers.\nOther aromatics, like minced garlic or chopped herbs, can be added along with the salt and pepper if desired.\nTo prevent the ends of the ribs from burning, cap each with a piece of aluminum foil.\nRead More\nPork Loin Roast With Winter Vegetables\nGarlic- and Herb-Roasted Pork Loin With Crackling and Spiced Apple Chutney\nUltra-Crispy Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder\nCuban-Style Roast Pork Shoulder With Mojo\nPork Mains\nChristmas\nGluten-free Mains\nRoasted Pork\nPork"
