Grease three 8-inch cake pans with butter and line with rounds of parchment paper. Set aside.\nSift flour, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt together, and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar on high speed for approximately five minutes, stopping periodically to scrape down the sides.\nReduce the mixer speed to low and begin adding the eggs, yolks, and vanilla in three additions, mixing thoroughly each time and stopping to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.\nStop the mixer and add half the dry mixture and half the buttermilk. Mix on low until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides and add the rest of the dry ingredients and buttermilk. Mix on low speed until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides and finish mixing by hand with a large spatula. Take care not to over mix.\nDivide the batter evenly between the three prepared cake pans and bake at 350\u00b0F for approximately 20 minutes, rotating halfway through. Remove from the oven when the tops are golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then run a knife along the edges to loosen and carefully invert onto cooling racks. slowly peel off the parchment and allow to cool completely before decorating.\nFor the soaker:\nCombine water and sugar in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the espresso powder. Allow the mixture to cool before use.\nFor the frosting:\nBring a medium-sized pot of water to a boil. Set a mixing bowl containing the egg whites and sugar over the pot of water and whisk vigorously and continuously for approximately 6 minutes, until the mixture reaches 140\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer.\nWhen the mixture has reached 140\u00b0F, quickly remove it from the heat, attach the bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, and whip the mixture on high speed until it reaches firm peaks and the bowl barely feels warm. Reduce the speed to medium and begin feeding butter into the bowl one tablespoon at a time. Whisk for 8-10 minutes, until the buttercream begins to stand up on its own. Add vanilla and espresso powder and whip on high speed until the powder dissolves, about 2 minutes.\nAssemble the cake:\nPlace the first layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Brush with the soaker, then cover the top with just shy of 1/4 inch of frosting in an even layer. Place the 2nd layer on top and do the same, covering with the 3rd layer. Brush the 3rd layer with soaker, then smooth a very thin layer of frosting over the entire exterior of the cake (crumb coat) and move to the fridge for 15 minutes.\nOnce the crumb coat has chilled, frost the cake with the remaining frosting, reserving a small amount for piping. Pipe decorations around the edges of the top and bottom of the cake. Sprinkle with chocolate shavings if desired. Refrigerate if not using right away, but be sure to allow the cake to sit out for 20 minutes away from heat before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nThree 8\" cake pans, star piping tips, instant read thermometer, stand mixer or hand mixer with whisk attachment\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSweet Technique: Prepping Cake Pans\nCakes\nBaking\nButtermilk",
