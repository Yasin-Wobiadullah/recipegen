Add almond flour to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread into a thin, even layer. Toast in oven, stirring every 3 minutes, until the almond flour is fragrant and light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, sugar, and orange zest, if using, on low speed to roughly incorporate. Increase to medium-high speed and beat until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes, pausing to scrape down bowl and beater with a flexible spatula as needed. Add almond flour, all-purpose flour, egg, brandy (if using), almond extract, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix on medium-high speed until smooth, thick, and creamy, pausing to to scrape down bowl and beater halfway through, about 2 minutes. Using a flexible spatula, scrape bowl and beater to ensure that no streaks of unmixed butter remain. (Almond cream can also be prepared in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUse immediately (see notes) or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 days.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nParchment paper\n,\nrimmed baking sheet, stand mixer, flexible spatula\nNote\nA note on blanched or natural almond flour: The blanching process removes the almond skins, so blanched almond flour has a finer texture than natural almond flour, which is ground from skin-on almonds. Blanched almond flour is also a solid beige color whereas natural almond flour appears speckled. Either variety will work well in this recipe; it all comes down to personal preference.\nAlmond cream can be used to fill tarts, danishes, twice-baked almond croissants, and galette de rois (also known as King Cake, which is enjoyed during Epiphany celebrations).\nBaking\nThe Latest\nFrench\nAlmonds"
