Process until a rough paste forms, then add yogurt and process until smooth. Transfer to a large zip top bag or leakproof container and add chicken. Marinate 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.\nSet broiler rack 4 inches from heat source and preheat broiler to high. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Remove chicken from zipper lock bag and wipe off excess marinade with hands. Lay out in a single layer on baking sheet and broil until color darkens and some dark blisters form, about 5 minutes. Flip chicken, rotate sheet pan, and broil until color darkens on other side, about 5 minutes. Repeat once or twice until chicken registers 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part, and one side has significant charring on edges. Set aside to rest. Alternatively, cook chicken thighs on a barbecue or grill pan until chicken registers 170\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part.\nFor the Sauce:\nIn a large, heavy pot, combine tomatoes, water, onion, garlic, ginger, chile, butter, cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and cook uncovered at a hard simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens to about 2 1/2 quarts, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Max Falkowitz\nTransfer 1/3 of sauce to the jar of a blender. Starting with low speed, gradually increase to high. Blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean large saucepan. Repeat with remaining two batches. Keep sauce warm over low heat and stir in fenugreek, black pepper, honey, and cream to taste. Season with salt to taste, then chop chicken tikka into bite-sized pieces and add to sauce. Serve with rice and a garnish of julienned ginger.\nSerious Eats / Max Falkowitz\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed sheet pan\n,\nfood processor\n,\nblender\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nChicken Mains\nIndian\nRoasted Chicken\nChicken Thighs"
