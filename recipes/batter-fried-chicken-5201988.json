Add chicken, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. Drain chicken and pat dry with paper towels.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Batter and Fry:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C). In a large Dutch oven or wok, heat oil over medium-high heat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk together potato starch, all-purpose flour, black pepper, baking powder, salt, paprika, and cayenne, about 30 seconds. Whisk in the water until a smooth batter forms, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSet a wire rack in a second rimmed baking sheet. Add half of chicken to batter and toss until well coated. Working with one piece at a time, lift chicken from batter, allowing any excess batter to drip back into bowl, and carefully add to hot oil, lowering it gently from as close to the oil\u2019s surface as possible to minimize splashing; repeat with remaining battered pieces of chicken. Fry chicken, turning occasionally, until thickest part of breast pieces registers 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C) and drumsticks/thighs registers 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 8 to 12 minutes for breast pieces and 10 to 14 minutes for thighs and drumsticks; adjust burner as necessary to maintain oil temperature between 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) and 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Transfer chicken to prepared wire rack, season with salt, and place in oven to keep warm. Return oil to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and repeat battering and frying with remaining chicken. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven\nor\nwok\nNotes\nBe sure to use unmodified potato starch such as Bob\u2019s Red Mill Premium Quality Unmodified Potato Starch. Using modified potato starch may produce slightly different results in texture and appearance.\nRead More\nThe Best Korean Fried Chicken\nThe Buttermilk-Brined Southern Fried Chicken\nHomemade Chicken Nuggets with Sweet 'n Sour Sauce\nFried Chicken\nChicken Mains\nSnacks & Appetizers\nChicken\nThe Latest",
