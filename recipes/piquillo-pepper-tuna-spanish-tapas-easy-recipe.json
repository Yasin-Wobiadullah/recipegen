Place a toothpick in each to secure it to the bread and serve immediately.\nNotes\nIf you don't want to make homemade allioli, you can make a quick cheaty version by whisking together 1/2 cup of store-bought mayonnaise, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 3 minced garlic cloves (about 1 tablespoon minced garlic), and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Season well with salt.\nIf you can't find piquillo peppers, substitute canned roasted red bell peppers cut into 1 inch wide strips. Assemble by spooning tuna salad on top of bread and laying a strip of bell pepper on top.\nRead More\nTortilla Espa\u00f1ola (Spanish Egg and Potato Omelette)\nPan Con Tomate (Spanish-Style Grilled Bread With Tomatoes)\nHors D'Oeuvres\nSpanish\nNo-Cook\nTuna\nPeppers"
