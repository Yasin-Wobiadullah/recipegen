Stir in chipotle chili powder and season with salt. If desired, strain to remove seeds. Let cool to room temperature.\nPreheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F. In a medium-sized bowl, stir together cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and pulled pork until evenly distributed. Spoon the filling generously into the halved jalape\u00f1os. Wrap a half-strip of bacon around the middle of each stuffed jalape\u00f1o half, tucking the cut sides underneath the poppers. Place the wrapped poppers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\nBake until the bacon is crisp and the cheese begins to brown, about 25 minutes. If you like your bacon extra crisp, turn the broiler on for the last 2 minutes.\nLet poppers cool slightly, then drizzle with raspberry sauce and garnish with cilantro. Serve warm.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nTo Reach Jalape\u00f1o Popper Perfection, Add Pulled Pork and Bacon\nSnacks & Appetizers\nFrying\nPork\nJalapenos",
