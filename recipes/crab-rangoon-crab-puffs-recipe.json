Combine remaining tablespoon water and cornstarch in a small bowl and whisk with a fork to form a slurry. Whisk into sauce and bring to a boil. Allow to cool while you form the crab rangoon.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nCombine cream cheese, crab, and scallions in a medium bowl and fold with a spatula. Lay one wonton wrapper out on a cutting board (keep the rest under plastic wrap or a damp towel) and place a small amount of filling in the center (about 1 1/2 teaspoons). Moisten the edges with a wet fingertip, then seal by either folding it in half in a triangular shape, or by pushing the four edges in towards the center to create a four-pointed star. Be careful not to allow any air to remain inside as you seal them. Transfer to a large plate, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and repeat until all of the filling is used.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nTo finish the sauce, add pineapple chunks and puree with an immersion blender or by transferring to a standing blender.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nHeat oil in a wok or Dutch oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) as registered on an instant read thermometer. Carefully add 10 to 12 wontons to the oil. Cook, adjusting flame to maintain temperature and agitating and flipping them constantly with a wire mesh spider until crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined bowl to drain, season with salt, and serve immediately with\nsweet and sour sauce\n.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nNotes\nCrab rangoons can be frozen after step 2. Space them out on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the freezer until completely frozen, then transfer to a zipper-lock bag. They'll keep for up to three months. The two teaspoons of chile flakes in this sauce will make it moderately spicy. You can adjust the heat level to your taste (or omit it entirely).\nCrab\nChinese-American\nFried Seafood\nSnacks & Appetizers"
