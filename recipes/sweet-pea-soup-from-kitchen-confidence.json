Add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the peas and half of the scallion greens (reserving the rest for garnish).

(Alternatively, puree the soup in batches in a standard blender.)\nReturn the soup pot to medium-high heat. Add the heavy cream and stir well. Cook until the soup is warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter until melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nTo serve, ladle the soup into serving bowls and garnish with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and pea shoots, if desired.\nSoups\nGluten-free Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop\nPeas",
