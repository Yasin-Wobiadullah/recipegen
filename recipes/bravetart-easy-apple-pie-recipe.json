Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then slice into 1/2-inch wedges; significant deviation can change the consistency of the filling.\nMeasure 50 ounces sliced apples (11 rounded cups; 1.45kg) into the bag, seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated. Macerate at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup, until the apples have lost a third of their volume, at least 3 hours. Apples can be held up to 8 hours in the fridge.\nAdd tapioca starch to apples, reseal, and toss to combine. Pour apple filling into prepared pie shell, nestling slices into a flattish mound. Stand top crust a few seconds at room temperature until pliable, then drape on top. Pinch to seal both crusts together and trim to 3/4 inch. Tuck dough under itself, so the pie looks something like a bonnet, or crimp into loose waves (the crust will not hold a tightly crimped design). Refrigerate pie until cold and firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\nFor Egg Wash:\nWhisk egg, yolk, cream, and salt together in a small bowl, then brush over chilled pie. With a sharp knife, cut six 3-inch vents around the top, wiggling blade left and right to open each into a wide vent.\nTo Bake:\nPlace pie on a parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pan and bake until 195\u00b0F (91\u00b0C) in the very center, about 75 minutes. This is easiest to monitor with an in-oven digital thermometer, which can be programmed to chime on reaching the target temperature.\nTo Serve:\nCool at least 1 hour at room temperature before serving. Wrapped in foil, leftovers will keep 3 days at room temperature. Warm in a 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) oven to restore the crispy crust and saucy filling.\nSpecial Equipment\nRolling pin\n, pastry brush, glass pie plate,\ndigital thermometer\n,\nhalf sheet pan\nNotes\nI love apple pie \u00e0 la mode, so my filling is seasoned rather generously. If you\u2019d prefer it plain or with slices of cheese, reduce the kosher salt to 1/2 teaspoon (2g). This recipe works best with tart green baking apples, such as Granny Smiths. With this technique, other types of apples may break down more rapidly in the oven, or, conversely, not cook through in the allotted time.\nRead More\nButtery, Flaky Pie Crust\nPerfect Apple Pie\nGooey Apple Pie\nPies\nThanksgiving Desserts\nChristmas Desserts\nApple\nWinter Desserts"
