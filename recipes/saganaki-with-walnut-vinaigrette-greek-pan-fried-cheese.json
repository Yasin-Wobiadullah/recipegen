Stir in honey and simmer until foamy, about 1 minute. Finish with lemon juice and parsley and set aside.\nFor the Cheese:\nIn a small cast iron skillet, heat neutral oil over high heat until smoking, about 3 minutes. Add cheese and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes, then flip, using a slotted offset spatula, to fry the other side. Remove from heat, leaving cheese in the pan.\nTo Flamb\u00e9 (optional):\nPour alcohol into a small pot and warm over medium heat until steaming, about 1 minute. Turn off heat and, using a stick lighter (see note), carefully light the fumes from the alcohol. Immediately pour the flaming alcohol over the cheese. (Use caution, as the fat in the pan will ignite in a glorious display.) Pour walnut vinaigrette on top to put out the flames. Serve right away alongside crusty bread or crackers.\nTo Serve Without Flamb\u00e9ing:\nPour walnut vinaigrette directly over fried cheese. Serve right away alongside crusty bread or crackers.\nSpecial equipment\n10-inch cast iron skillet\n, stick lighter\nNotes\nUsing a stick lighter to flame the alcohol keeps your fingers safe.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSaganaki: Set Fire to the Cheese, Watch It Burn\nCheese\nGreek\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nStovetop\nWalnuts"
