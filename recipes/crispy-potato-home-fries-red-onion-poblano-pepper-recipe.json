  "full_text": "Crispy Home Fries With Red Onions and Roasted Poblano Pepper Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nActive\n35 mins\nTotal\n50 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\nmedium\nfresh\nPoblano pepper\n(optional; see notes)\n1 1/4\npounds\n(\n575\ng\n) small new or\nfingerling potatoes\nKosher salt\n1\ntablespoon\n(\n15\nml\n)\ndistilled\u00a0white vinegar\n1/4\ncup\n(\n60\nml\n)\nvegetable oil\n, divided\n1\nsmall\nred onion\n, cut into thick slices\n2\nteaspoons\n(about\n4\ng\n) minced\nfresh thyme\nFreshly\nground black pepper\nSmall\nhandful\nminced fresh cilantro\nor parsley\nDirections\nIf using, place Poblano pepper directly over the flame of a gas burner, turning with tongs until well charred on all surfaces. Alternatively, place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet directly under a preheated broiler and broil, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides, about 8 minutes. Wrap charred pepper in foil to trap steam, and set aside. When cool enough to handle, carefully remove skin from pepper (it should slip right off). Remove and discard stems and seeds. Cut into strips.\nMeanwhile, place potatoes in a pot and cover with 2 quarts (2L) of cold water. Add 2 tablespoons (30g) kosher salt and vinegar. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until potatoes are tender, about 5 minutes after they reach a boil. Drain. As soon as potatoes are cool enough to handle, split into quarters and toss with 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil in a bowl.\nTo Finish:\nHeat 2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add potatoes and cook, tossing, until crisp and golden brown on all sides, about 6 minutes. Return to bowl.\nAdd remaining tablespoon (15ml) oil to skillet and add red onion. Cook, tossing occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return potatoes to skillet and add roasted pepper strips, if using. Toss to combine and season to taste with plenty of salt and pepper. Add cilantro or parsley and toss to combine. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nThe recipe can be prepared through the end of step 2 before completing. Store the roasted chiles and the parboiled potatoes in the refrigerator for up to 3 days before continuing.\nI love the flavor of roasted Poblano pepper strips in this dish, but it adds quite a bit of prep time, and the home fries will be delicious even without them. If you decide not to roast the pepper, you can either omit it completely or simply slice a Poblano or bell pepper and saut\u00e9 it along with the onion in step 4.\nNew Potatoes\nStovetop\nOnions\nPoblano Peppers\nBreakfast & Brunch",
