Add the broth, adjust the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the chicken has cooked through, about 12 minutes more.

Add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. Drain, reserving broth for another use if desired, and immediately toss in a serving bowl with the miso-butter. Toss to coat, then add in the chicken. Top with scallions, cilantro and sprouts.
