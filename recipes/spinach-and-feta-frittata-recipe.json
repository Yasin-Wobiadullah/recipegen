Heat olive oil in an 8 inch non-stick skillet over medium high heat, until shimmering. Add shallo and cook until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook until softened, about 2 minutes longer. Add spinach and oregano and cook, tossing often until spinach is fully wilted and any water released by the spinach has cooked off, about 6 minutes total. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nIn a large bowl, beat eggs and milk with a whisk until incorporated. Add feta and season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over spinach then gently stir with a spatula to release the spinach from the bottom of the pan so that the eggs are in direct contact with the surface of the pan.\nCook until eggs are almost totally set, about 12 minutes, reducing heat if necessary to prevent burning. Place pan under the broiler until the top is set as well, keeping a close eye on it so it does not burn, about 2 minutes longer.\nTo release the frittata from the pan, loosen edges with a spatula. Place a dinner plate over pan, and holding plate firmly flip the pan over so the frittata releases onto the plate. Serve warm with toast and sliced scallions.\nSpecial equipment\n8 inch non-stick skillet\nGluten-free Breakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nStovetop Eggs\nFeta Cheese\nSpinach",
