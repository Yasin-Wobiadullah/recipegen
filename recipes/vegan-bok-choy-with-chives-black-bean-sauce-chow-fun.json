Check your local Chinatown or a good Asian grocery. Steamed rice noodles need to be used the day they are made. Do not refrigerate them or they will become brittle/stale very rapidly. If you can't find chow fun noodles, any cooked vegan Chinese noodle will work.\nRead More\nThe Best Vegan Mapo Tofu\nVegan Dan Dan Noodles\nChinese\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStir-Fry Noodles\nVegetable Stir-Fry",
