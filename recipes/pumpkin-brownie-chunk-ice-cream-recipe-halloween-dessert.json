Slowly whisk in cream and milk until smooth.\nSet on medium-low heat and, whisking frequently, cook until custard thickly coats the back of a spoon but a swiped finger leaves a clean line. Stir in bourbon, strain into an airtight container, and chill overnight.\nThe next day, churn according to manufacturer's instructions. When finished, remove churning puddle and quickly stir in brownie chunks with a wide spatula. Transfer to freezer and chill for 2 to 3 hours or until firm.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nNotes\nThe brownie chunks need to stay soft even when frozen. To achieve that I don't think you can do better than Smitten Kitchen's\ncocoa brownies\n. They're dead simple to make and are dark enough to stay flavorful under deep chill. This recipe calls for about 2/3 of the batch, leaving you with some to snack on while the ice cream churns. Let the brownies cool completely before cutting into small (1/2-inch) chunks, and trim away the crisp edges.\nRead More\nPumpkin Spice Ice Cream\nPumpkin Pie Ice Cream\nIce Cream Recipes That Use Fall and Winter Fruit\nThe Best Way to Store Ice Cream in Your Freezer\nIce Cream\nChocolate\nPumpkin"
