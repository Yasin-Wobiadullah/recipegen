Add cubed butter and, using either your hands or a pastry cutter, cut into flour mixture until pea-sized pieces form. Add egg yolks and continue cutting until flour mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in heavy cream with a wooden spoon until incorporated. Let dough stand for 5 minutes.\nGenerously dust work surface with white rice flour. Turn dough onto work surface and dust with more white rice flour. Gently knead the dough a few times, then pat into a large rectangle, about 1 inch thick. Using a 2-inch round cutter, cut out four dough rounds. Gather up dough scraps, pat into a 1-inch-thick rectangle, and cut out 4 more dough rounds; discard remaining dough scraps. Place dough rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush the tops with remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar on top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, for the Toppings:\nStir together strawberries, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Using the back of a fork, gently mash a few of the sliced strawberries. Allow strawberries to stand for 1 hour.\nIn medium bowl, whip heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and beat until stiff peaks form.\nAdjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Remove plastic wrap from baking sheet and bake shortcakes until edges just turn golden brown, about 12 minutes. Let shortcakes cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve shortcakes warm or at room temperature, topping with macerated strawberries and whipped cream.\nSpecial equipment\n2-inch round cutter\nCakes\nGluten-free Desserts\nStrawberry\nSummer Desserts"
