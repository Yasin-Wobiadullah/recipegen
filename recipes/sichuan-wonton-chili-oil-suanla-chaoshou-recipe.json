Transfer a teaspoon-sized amount to a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power until cooked through, about 10 seconds. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt, white pepper, and/or sugar if desired.\nSet up a work station with a small bowl of water, a clean dish towel for wiping your fingers, a bowl with the wonton filling, a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet for the finished wontons, and a stack of wonton wrappers covered in plastic wrap.\nSerious Eats\nTo form dumplings hold one wrapper on top of a flat hand. Using a spoon, place a 2 teaspoon- to 1 tablespoon-sized amount of filling in the center of the wrapper. Use the tip of the finger on your other hand to very gently moisten the edge of the wrapper with water (do not use too much water). Wipe fingertip dry on kitchen towel.\nSerious Eats\nCarefully fold one tip of the wonton wrapper across to meet the opposite tip to form a triangle. Seal edges of the triangle, carefully pushing out all air from within the wrapper as you work. Pull the two corners on the hypotenuse of the newly formed triangle to meet, moistening one with a little water, crossing them and pinching to seal. Transfer finished dumplings to the parchment lined baking sheet.\nSerious Eats\nFor the Sauce:\nPlace chiles and Sichuan peppercorns on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high until toasted and aromatic, about 15 seconds. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or a food processor and crush until it's about the texture of store-bought crushed red pepper flakes. Transfer to a small saucepan.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Immediately pour hot oil over chile/peppercorn mixture (it should sizzle). Let cool for 5 minutes then transfer to a medium bowl. Add sesame oil and set aside.\nCombine sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic in a small bowl and stir until sugar is dissolved. Add chili oil mixture. Set aside until ready to use. (Sauce can be stored in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks).\nSerious Eats\nTo Cook and Serve:\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 12 to 16 wontons and cook until they are completely cooked through, about 4 minutes. Drain wontons and transfer to a warm serving platter. Spoon sauce on top. Sprinkle with peanuts and minced cilantro and serve immediately.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTo freeze, place the entire plate of uncooked wontons into the freezer uncovered and let them rest until fully frozen, about half an hour, then transfer the frozen wontons to a zipper-lock freezer bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, seal the bag, and store them for up to 2 months. The wontons can be boiled straight from frozen.\nChinese\nDairy-free Snacks & Appetizers\nPork Shoulder\nSnacks & Appetizers",
