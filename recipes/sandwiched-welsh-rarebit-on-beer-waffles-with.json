Place a baking sheet on lower-middle rack. Heat waffle iron according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nIn large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks, melted butter, buttermilk, and ale.\nIn clean, dry bowl, beat egg whites on medium speed until firm, but not dry, peaks form.\nWhisk beer mixture into flour mixture until incorporated. With rubber spatula, fold in egg whites.\nLightly coat waffle iron with cooking spray. Cook waffles according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions, until crisp and golden. With tongs, carefully transfer to baking sheet in oven and repeat procedure until you run out of batter (see notes).\nFor the Sauce:\nCook bacon in 2 to 3 batches in large skillet over medium heat until crisp and golden, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Reserve 2 tablespoons fat, and discard any additional rendered fat accumulated between batches. With slotted spoon, transfer cooked bacon paper towel-lined plate. Alternatively, line dinner plate with 2 layers paper towels. Arrange 4 bacon slices on top, then cover with 2 more layers paper towels. Microwave 4 to 6 minutes until crisp. Repeat with remaining bacon and fresh paper towels.\nCook scallions over medium heat in rendered bacon fat (if you microwaved the bacon, cook the scallions in 2 tablespoons butter) until softened, about 3 minutes. Reserve.\nMelt 4 tablespoons butter in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until pale golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in Worcestershire, dry mustard, and cayenne and cook 30 seconds. In a slow, steady stream add cream and ale, whisking constantly and vigorously to avoid lumps. Whisk in egg yolks. Add cheese and cook, stirring, until completely melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nFor the Assembly:\nTransfer waffles on tray to cooling rack and increase oven heat to broil. Break each bacon strip in half. Top each waffle with 4 pieces bacon and 2 slices tomato, then sprinkle with the cooked scallions. Spoon about 1/4 cup sauce over each and broil on top rack until bubbling and brown at the edges (time will vary according to oven). Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nbaking sheet, rubber spatula, waffle iron, whisk, electric mixer, tongs, large skillet or dinner plate and microwave oven, paper towels, large heavy-bottomed saucepan, cooling rack\nBreakfast & Brunch\nNorthern European\nBacon\nTomato\nWaffles"
