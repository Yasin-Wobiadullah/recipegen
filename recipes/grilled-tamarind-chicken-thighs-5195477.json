Pulse until finely chopped, about 7 pulses. Add tamarind paste, fish sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, tomato paste, garlic powder, onion powder, ground ginger, and salt. Process until a rough pur\u00e9e forms, about 45 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nTransfer marinade to a large bowl along with chicken and toss until chicken is thoroughly coated with marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nLight 1 chimney full of charcoal\n. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set the burners on a gas grill to the medium setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes.\nClean and oil\ngrilling grate.\nRemove chicken from marinade, allow excess marinade to drip off, and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet; discard marinade. Place chicken skin-side up directly on the grill. Cover grill, with vents on lid open if using a charcoal grill, and cook until chicken is charred in spots, about 10 minutes (if chicken is charring too quickly, close the vents). Flip chicken, cover, and continue to cook until skin is crispy and charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of each chicken thigh registers 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nTransfer chicken to a serving platter and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Serve with white rice.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nSpecial Equipment\nGas\nor\ncharcoal\ngrill,\nfood processor\nor\nblender\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nSiling mahaba is a Filipino chile with moderate heat. It's sold in many Filipino and Asian markets. If you cannot find siling mahaba, substitute with 1 jalape\u00f1o pepper.\nTamarind concentrate (also sold as tamarind paste) can be found at Asian supermarkets or online. It should be smooth and pourable, strained of any seeds and fibers. I recommend the brand Tamicon for its smooth consistency and moderate tartness.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe marinade can be prepared in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week before using.\nGrilled chicken thighs can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days.\nRead More\nSinigang na Baboy (Filipino Pork in Sour Tamarind Soup) Recipe\nChicken Inasal (Filipino Grilled Chicken) Recipe\nBaked Chicken Wings With Tamarind-Ginger Glaze Recipe\nThai-Style Chicken Satay With Peanut-Tamarind Dipping Sauce Recipe\nFilipino\nChicken Thighs\nGrilled Chicken",
