If the stand mixer bowl has a metal foot, use a glass or ceramic bowl instead, in which case the foil ring is not needed.\nFor the Semifreddo:\nCombine cream, vanilla, and rose water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, and whip until stiff. The time will vary depending on the power of a given mixer, so keep a close eye on the process. Transfer to a separate bowl or plate, then cover and refrigerate until needed. Rinse the stand mixer bowl and whisk, then wipe dry before re-using in step 5.\nCombine eggs, honey, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a glass or ceramic bowl, if the stand mixer bowl has a foot). Stir with a flexible spatula to combine. Place over the prepared water bath, so that the bowl does not touch the water, and adjust heat to maintain a gentle simmer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCook, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until warmed to 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), about 10 minutes in a stainless steel bowl, or about 15 if using glass or ceramic. If the process seems to be taking much longer, simply increase the heat; top the hot water bath up with more hot water if needed at any point. Once the mixture reaches 165\u00b0F, transfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip on high speed until eggs are foamy, more than quadrupled in size, and thick enough to briefly mound up like soft-serve ice cream when dropped from the whisk, between 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the mixer's power. The bowl itself should also feel cool to the touch.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWorking by hand, gently whisk in half of the prepared whipped cream. Once smooth, add the remainder, whisk briefly, then fold with a flexible spatula until well combined. Scrape into the prepared loaf pan, cover tightly, and freeze until firm enough to slice, about 8 hours or to an internal temperature of 0\u00b0F (-17\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Serve:\nPlace a platter large enough to accommodate the loaf in the freezer until cold. Invert the semifreddo onto the chilled platter, using the plastic or parchment paper to pull it free. Leave the semifreddo covered, and return to the freezer until time for dessert. Then, tug loose the plastic or parchment, and top as desired with macerated fruit, toasted nuts, sauces, or whatever you prefer. Let the semifreddo stand a minute or two at room temperature, then slice with a chef's knife dipped or rinsed in hot water between each slice. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\ndigital thermometer\n,\n9- by 5-inch loaf pan\nNotes\nThe honey's character shines through clearly in this recipe, so it's a beautiful showcase for the unique characteristics of local and seasonal honey. Look for honey at the farmers' market or shops that specialize in local products, as its flavor will be more rewarding than generic supermarket blends.\nRead More\nLime Semifreddo with Pretzel Crust\nMocha Mascarpone Icebox Cake\nBlackberry Pistachio Icebox Cake\n10 No-Churn Ice Cream Recipes, No Ice Cream Maker Required\nIce Cream\nGluten-free Desserts\nEaster Desserts\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
