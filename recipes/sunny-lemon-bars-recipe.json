Combine flour, powdered sugar, salt, lemon zest, and butter in the bowl of a food processor; pulse to form a dry but pebbly meal, about 12 one-second pulses. Scatter into the prepared baking pan, press into an even layer, and bake until pale gold and firm, about 30 minutes. Use hot or set aside until needed, up to 48 hours at room temperature if tightly covered.\nVicky Wasik\nFor the Custard:\nCombine sugar, whole eggs, yolks, lemon zest, and salt in a 3-quart stainless steel saucepan, then whisk in lemon juice. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly but not vigorously, until warm to the touch, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until thick and steaming-hot (custard should register 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer), about 8 minutes. Immediately strain into the prepared crust, smooth into an even layer, and cover with aluminum foil. Bake until smooth and firm, about 10 minutes. Remove foil and cool to room temperature, then re-cover and refrigerate until cold and firm, about 1 hour.\nVicky Wasik\nTo Serve:\nLoosen chilled custard from sides of pan with a bench or butter knife, then carefully tug loose and lift using overhanging parchment and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 16 two-inch squares, rinsing the knife clean between each slice. Serve plain, lightly dusted with powdered sugar, or topped with Lemon Chantilly and Crispy Citrus-Candied Pistachios. Store up to 1 week in an airtight container.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n8- by 8- by 2-inch anodized-aluminum baking pan\n,\nfood processor\n,\n3-quart stainless steel saucepan or saucier\n,\nstainless steel whisk\n,\nfine-mesh stainless steel strainer\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nThis recipe works best with the bright acidity of traditional supermarket lemons, not mellow Meyers, in order to balance the sweetness of the custard. Be sure to save the leftover rinds, which form the basis of\nfresh lemon syrup\n.\nDessert Bars\nEaster\nMother's Day\nLemon\nEaster Desserts"
