Fit the machine with a paddle attachment, and mix on low until the powdered sugar is fully incorporated. Add vanilla and salt, then increase speed to medium and beat until the frosting is airy and light, pausing along the way to scrape the bowl and beater as needed. This will take about 6 minutes, although the exact timing will vary depending on the power of the machine. During this time, the mixture will have warmed to approximately 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReduce speed to low, then drizzle in the cream. When fully incorporated, pause to scrape the bowl and beater, then continue beating a few seconds more on medium speed. Taste and adjust salt and vanilla as needed, or add whatever other extracts or gel colors are desired. Use immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n,\nflexible spatula\nNotes\nIf you don't have organic powdered sugar on hand, conventional powdered sugar will be fine; just add 1/2 teaspoon of plain, unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap) along with the salt and vanilla to create a similar depth of flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis frosting is best used right away.\nRead More\nA Guide to Cake Frosting\nThe World of Buttercreams: 6 Varieties to Try at Home\n7 Aromatic Vanilla Extracts to Step Up Your Dessert Game\nWhat's Different About Organic Powdered Sugar, and Why It Matters\nDesserts\nAmerican\nGluten-free Desserts\nNo-Cook Desserts",
