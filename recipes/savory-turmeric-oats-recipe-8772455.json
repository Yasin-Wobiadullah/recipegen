Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds and cook, allowing seeds to sizzle and pop, until they stop popping and darken slightly, about 30 seconds. Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are translucent and have begun to soften and brown around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Add coriander, red pepper flakes, and turmeric, and saut\u00e9 until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Shri Repp\nAdd tomato and pepper and cook until softened and pepper is bright green, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups water, salt, and oats, stirring to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook uncovered, stirring gently and frequently, until oats have softened and thickened but mixture still flows slightly, 8 to 10 minutes. (For looser oatmeal, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach your desired consistency.) Remove from heat and divide oats evenly between two bowls. Garnish with cilantro and serve with a squeeze of lime juice, halved boiled eggs, and yogurt, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Shri Repp\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce cooled, the finished oatmeal, without the garnishes, can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Leftover oatmeal can be reheated in the microwave or in a saucepan on the stove until warmed through; add water as needed to loosen. Garnish just before serving.\nOats\nThe Latest\nIndian\nBreakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian",
