If using fresh bread, arrange slices in a single layer on rack and cook in oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 20 minutes. (If the bread is stale, you can skip this toasting step.)\nMeanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, rum, orange zest, vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and star anise (if using) until thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a medium bowl with either an electric mixer or a whisk, beat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche until soft peaks form. Set aside.\nHeat 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat, swirling skillet, until foaming subsides. Meanwhile, soak 2 to 3 slices of bread in egg bath, turning, until saturated. Add soaked bread to skillet and cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle top side of bread with sugar, flip, and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer French toast to rack in oven in a single layer to keep warm and repeat with remaining slices of bread and egg bath. Allow each batch of French toast to heat in oven for at least 10 minutes (but not more than 30) to ensure it is fully cooked through.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe French toast with whipped cream and maple syrup.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial equipment\nWire rack, rimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nYou can also sprinkle the French toast with Demerara or muscovado sugar for a more molasses-y flavor.\nRead More\nPerfect Quick-and-Easy French Toast Recipe\nHong Kong-Style French Toast Recipe\nBananas Foster French Toast Recipe\nTorrijas Caramelizadas (Spanish-Style Caramelized French Toast) Recipe\nSavory Green Curry French Toast Recipe\nFrench Toast\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nEaster\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
