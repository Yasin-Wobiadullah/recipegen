Let cool completely.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large bowl, combine lettuce, tomatoes, and scallions. Sprinkle a few pinches of toasted kasha on top and season with salt. Drizzle with just enough vinaigrette, gently tossing with clean hands to lightly coat lettuce leaves. Serve right away. Reserve extra kasha for another use (such as a garnish for other dishes).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nThe kasha is sold as \"toasted\" kasha, but you'll be toasting it again in the skillet with oil.\nUse any variety of tender green lettuces you can find, or a single variety if that's what's available.\nRead More\nMarinate Tough Greens, Use Fresh Herbs, and More Pro Tips for Better Salads\nHow to Make a Mixed-Green Salad Like You Actually Care\nWinter Greens Salad With Flax Seeds, Shaved Beets, and Radishes Recipe\nGreen Salad With Pickled Mushrooms, Cucumbers, Onions, and Pecorino Recipe\nQuick Salads\nVegan Salads\nScallions"
