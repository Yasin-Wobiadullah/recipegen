Using a sharp knife, score the top side of the chicken thighs 2 or 3 times, then prick all over with a fork. Place the chicken in a baking dish, ziptop bag, or a food-safe storage container with a lid.\nSerious Eats / Nik Sharma\nIn a blender, combine yogurt, scallions, mint, peppercorns, garlic, ginger, chile, turmeric, and salt. Pulse until very smooth. Pour the yogurt mixture all over the chicken, then gently toss to coat well. Cover the container or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.\nSerious Eats / Nik Sharma\nTo Pickle the Nectarines:\nHeat a small dry skillet over medium heat. Add the coriander seeds to the hot skillet and toast until the seeds become fragrant and start to darken slightly, about 1 minute. Transfer toasted coriander seeds to a mortar and pestle and crush to a coarse powder.\nSerious Eats / Nik Sharma\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the vinegar, honey, and salt until combined. Stir in the chile flakes and coriander powder.\nCut the nectarines in half and remove and discard the stone. Cut the nectarines into thin segments and add them to the vinegar mixture along with the thyme. Stir to coat the fruit well. Cover with a lid and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day before serving.\nSerious Eats / Nik Sharma\nTo Cook the Chicken:\nWhen ready to cook, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and spray the foil with a little oil. Spread the marinated thighs over the prepared baking sheet, 4 pieces per sheet. Bake the chicken until an instant-read thermometer registers 175\u00b0F (79\u00b0C) in the thickest part of the thighs and the edges are slightly browned, about 30 minutes. Remove the chicken, cover, and let it stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve the chicken with the pickled nectarines on the side.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nor\nimmersion blender\n,\nmortar and pestle\n,\nrimmed baking sheets\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nIf using Greek yogurt, use half as much yogurt and substitute half with water.\nFor a stronger kick of heat, double the amount of chile pepper in the recipe.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe chicken can be frozen in its marinade for up to 2 weeks. The quick-pickled nectarines are best eaten the day they're made, but they keep for up to 1 day if stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nRead More\nYogurt-Marinated Chicken Kebabs with Aleppo Pepper\nBroiled Tandoori-Style Chicken With Almonds and Couscous\nYogurt- and Mint-Marinated Lamb Skewers\nIndian\nRoasted Chicken\nChicken Thighs\nNectarine\nYogurt & Cultured Dairy"
