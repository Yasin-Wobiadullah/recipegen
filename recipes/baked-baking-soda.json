  "full_text": "Baked Baking Soda (Sodium Carbonate) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n2 hrs\nActive\n10 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 5 mins\nServes\n408 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n920\ng\n(about\n32\noz\n)\nbaking soda\nDirections\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Note the weight of the foil-lined baking sheet using a digital scale. Spread baking soda in an even layer and place baking sheet in oven.\nBake, stirring the baking soda every half hour, until the weight of the baking soda is reduced to 613g (~21 oz), which is 2/3 of the starting weight (weigh the baking sheet with the baking soda, then deduct the recorded weight of the lined baking sheet to determine the weight of the baking soda itself). The amount of time this can take can vary quite a bit, anywhere from 2 to 5 hours.\nRemove from the oven and, when cool, store in an airtight container; be careful not to handle the baked baking soda with bare skin.\nNotes\nDo not let the baked baking soda come in contact with your skin, as it is a caustic substance. If you do make contact with the baked baking soda, flush the area thoroughly with water.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nSealed in an airtight container, the baked baking soda will keep indefinitely.\nRead More\nFor Ramen Geeks Only: How to Make Low-Hydration Noodles at Home\nHow to Make Ramen Noodles From Scratch\n38%-Hydration, Whole Wheat Homemade Ramen Noodles\n35%-Hydration Homemade Ramen Noodles\nBaking\nRamen",
