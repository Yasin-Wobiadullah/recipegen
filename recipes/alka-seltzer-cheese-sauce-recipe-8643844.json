We also recommend reading the full Alka-Seltzer ingredient list just in case it contains anything you or a diner may be specifically allergic to.\nThis sauce can also be made on stove top: In a saucepan, combine water with Alka-Seltzer and let stand until fizzing ceases. Add butter and heat over medium heat until melted, then whisk in shredded cheese until fully melted and a smooth sauce has formed. Season with flavorings of choice, let cool slightly, then use as desired.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe Alka-Seltzer can be dissolved in the water up to 1 hour ahead.\nCheese\nThe Latest\nFood Science\nCondiments & Sauces",
