Continue to cook until the two integrate into a syrup, about 5 more minutes. Then add pomegranate molasses and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring to dissolve. Remove from heat.\nLet mixture cool to room temperature, then pour into glass container. Add rosewater, seal, and shake. Refrigerate and use as soon as it's cool, or store in refrigerator for up to one month.\nNotes\nIf you are juicing the pomegranate yourself, one large pomegranate usually yields about 1 cup of juice. If you opt to start with juice, be sure to buy pure pomegranate juice that is not made from concentrate or blended with other juices. Using juices from concentrate or blends will result in grenadine with less depth and brightness of flavor.\nIf you choose to leave the pomegranate molasses out, you'll need to add a bit more sugar.\nRead More\nHow to Make Pomegranate Molasses From Fresh Fruit or Juice\nPomegranate Bourbon Cocktail\nMarrakesh Express (Pomegranate Mezcal Cocktail With HArissa) Recipe\nCocktails\nPomegranate"
