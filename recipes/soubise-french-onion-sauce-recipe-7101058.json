Stir in cream and simmer for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer hot onions and cream to a blender. Add curry powder or Vadouvan if using, and blend, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high, until a smooth sauce forms. If desired, pass sauce through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids with a spoon, for an even more refined texture. Return onion sauce to saucepan and season with salt and white pepper (note that sauce should have a texture that's thicker than most sauces but thinner than a puree). Keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nSpecial Equipment\nMedium saucepan,\nblender\n, fine mesh strainer\nNotes\nVadouvan, a French curry powder flavored with shallots and garlic, is available in specialty food stores and\u00a0online.\nRead More\nRoasted Chicken with Soubise (Onion Sauce) Recipe\nFrench\nOnions\nCondiments & Sauces\nEurope\nWestern European"
