Using mixer fitted with whip attachment, beat whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until frothy. Increases speed to medium-high and beat until beginning to form soft peak. Slowly add 1/3 cup sugar and continue to whip to stiff but not dry peak, about 3 minutes. Transfer meringue to a large bowl.\nUsing same unwashed mixer fitted with whip attachment, combine remaining 1 1/3 cups sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda on low speed, about 30 seconds.\nAdd yolks, oil, 1/3 cup water, lemon juice, zest, and vanilla. Increase speed to medium and beat until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute.\nRemove bowl from mixer, making sure to scrape all the zest from the beaters. Gently fold in egg white meringue in three stages until just combined. Pour into ungreased 10-inch tube pan and bake until golden, just set, and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.\nTransfer pan to cool on wire rack until completely cool, about 2 hours. Run knife along inside edges of pan and invert cake onto serving plate.\nNotes\nResist the urge to turn the pan upside down after removing from the oven. This cake is heftier than an angel food cake, and may fall out of the pan.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch angel food cake pan, mixer\nThis Recipe Appears In\nLet Them Eat: Lemon Chiffon Cake\nCakes\nSummer Desserts",
