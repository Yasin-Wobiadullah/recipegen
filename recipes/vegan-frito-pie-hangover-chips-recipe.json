Bring to a boil over high heat. Add jalape\u00f1o and red onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions have lightly softened and are translucent and jalape\u00f1os have become dirty green, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. See note.\nCarefully slit open the front of the Fritos bag with a knife or kitchen shears and pull sides apart. Place bag with opening facing up in a bowl. Add half of chili and stir to combine. Top with remaining chili. Garnish with pickled onions and jalape\u00f1o rings, sliced avocado, cilantro, and scallions if desired. Allow to sit until softened to desired texture and eat with lime wedge (if desired).\nNotes\nThis recipe makes more pickled red onions than you need. Store leftover pickled red onions in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two months. You can use any vegetarian chili recipe you'd like, such as\nvegetarian chili\n, or\nvegan sweet potato and 2-bean chili with hominy\n.\nRead More\nKimchi Frito Pie Recipe\nChilaquiles With Pepitas, Charred Corn, and Black Beans Recipe\nVegan Migas (Mexican-Style Fried Tortillas With Tofu) Recipe\nChili\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nVegan Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nGame Day"
