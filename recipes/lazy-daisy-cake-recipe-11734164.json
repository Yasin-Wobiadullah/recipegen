Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with unsalted butter, then dust with flour, shaking out excess.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine butter and whole milk. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat; set aside and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip eggs and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until yolks are thick, pale yellow, and doubled in volume, about 7 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nReduce mixer speed to low, and slowly pour in milk and butter mixture. Reserve saucepan for topping; no need to clean. Continue to whisk until combined, about 15 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWith the mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture 1/4 cup at a time until just incorporated, about 2 minutes. Using a flexible spatula, scrape down sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure there are no dry bits. (If any remain, use spatula to gently fold until incorporated.)

Reduce heat to low. Whisk in brown sugar, salt, and milk and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes. (Mixture will sputter slightly\u2014this is normal.) Remove from heat and fold in coconut; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCarefully remove cake from oven and dollop coconut topping over it, using a spoon or offset spatula to spread evenly from side to side. Bake until coconut topping is golden brown, 20 to 25 more minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 13-inch baking pan, stand mixer, flexible spatula, whisk\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce cooled, the cake can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.\nCakes\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nDesserts\nCoconut",
