Place chicken tenders in zipper-lock bag and add brine. Transfer to refrigerator and let sit for 1 hour. Combine flour, thyme, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon baking powder, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and white pepper in a large bowl. Whisk together 1 cup buttermilk and eggs in a small bowl. Set both bowls aside.\nMeanwhile, make the dipping sauce:\nIn small bowl, stir cranberry sauce, mustard, honey, thyme, and vinegar to combine.\nPrepare the fries:\nIn large bowl, combine rice flour, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder. Drizzle 3 tablespoons buttermilk into rice flour mixture and rub with fingertips until the mixture is coarse like wet sand; set aside. Combine the potato sticks and remaining 13 tabkespoons buttermilk in large bowl; set aside.\nDrizzle 3 tablespoons of the buttermilk/egg mixture into flour mixture and rub with fingertips until the flour mixture is coarse like wet sand. Remove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to buttermilk/egg mixture.\nIn a Dutch oven or deep fryer over medium heat, heat oil to 350\u00b0F. Working one tender at a time, allow excess buttermilk to drip off and then transfer to flour mixture to coat well, pressing coating into tender. Shake off excess flour and transfer to plate. Repeat with remaining tenders.\nFrying in batches of 5 tenders at a time, carefully lower tenders into hot oil. Cook, turning tenders occasionally, until golden brown and crisp on all sides, and the chicken is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes total. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Return oil to temperature and repeat with remaining tenders.\nIncrease oil temperature to 375\u00b0F. Working in three batches, lift 1/3 of the potato sticks from the buttermilk and let excess liquid drip off. Drop into rice flour mixture and toss to coat.\nCarefully drop in hot oil and fry until tender and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Sprinkle with chopped thyme and salt to taste. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nlarge dutch oven or heavy duty pot for frying, instant read thermometer\nChicken Mains\nFried Chicken\nSweet Potatoes"
