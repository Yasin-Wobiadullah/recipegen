Finely chop 10 Thin Mints (crumbs should be no larger than a pea) and stir into dairy.\nPut saucepan on medium-low heat and cook, whisking frequently, until custard reaches 180\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer (custard should coat the back of a spoon but a swiped finger should leave a clean line). Remove custard from heat and stir in chocolate, then salt to taste.\nWhen chocolate is fully melted and incorporated, transfer to an airtight container and chill overnight in refrigerator.\nThe next day, churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.
