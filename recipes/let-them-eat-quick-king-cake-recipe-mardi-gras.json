Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nMicrowave in small bowl (or bring to boil in small saucepan) raisins, bourbon, orange zest, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 2 minutes in microwave, 5 minutes in saucepan. Cool to room temperature, 5 to 10 minutes.\nIn large bowl, using two dinner knives, cut in pecans, brown sugar, cream cheese, ginger, flour, and salt until mixture resembles coarse meal. Alternatively, work mixture together with fingertips. Stir in cooled raisin mixture.\nDust clean, dry counter with flour. Flour rolling pin. Roll pastry out to 20- by 15-inches. Distribute filling evenly over dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Place fava anywhere on filling.\nStarting at the long end, roll dough up into a log. Transfer log to prepared baking sheet and shape into an oval, pressing ends to seal. Beat egg yolk and cream and brush over log.\nBake until puffed and golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to cooling rack and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.\nFor the Glaze:\nWhisk confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream, bourbon, and salt together in medium bowl. Drizzle over cooled cake and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Serve.\nNotes\nTo toast pecans, arrange them on rimmed baking sheet and bake at 350\u00b0F on middle rack for 10 to 12 minutes until golden.\nI recommend using all-butter Dufour brand puff pastry, but use whatever brand you prefer.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet, parchment paper, microwave or small saucepan, rolling pin, pastry brush, cooling rack\nCakes\nMardi Gras",
