  "full_text": "Pumpkin in Sweet Coconut Cream (Fak Thong Kaeng Buat) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\npound\ncalabaza pumpkin\nor kabocha squash (about half a medium pumpkin)\n4\ncups\nfull fat\ncoconut milk\n3 2/5\ncups\ngranulated sugar\n1/2\nteaspoon\nsalt\nDirections\nRemove pumpkin seeds and trim off the slimy, stringy parts that are attached to the seeds. Peeling is optional if you use calabaza or kabocha. Most of the time, in Thailand, the peel is left on for texture and to help pumpkin pieces hold their shape somewhat better. But if you don't like the texture of cooked pumpkin peels, you can remove the peel. Cut pumpkin pulp into bite-sized chunks of roughly the same size.\nPlace pumpkin pieces, coconut milk, sugar, and salt in a 2-quart saucepan; bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Once coconut cream is boiling, taste for sweetness. Add more sugar, if needed. After 10-12 minutes, pumpkin pieces should be fork-tender. Immediately remove saucepan from heat. (Do not cover as residual heat will continue to cook pumpkin.) Allow it to cool to lukewarm and serve.\nPumpkin\nThai\nCoconut Milk & Cream\nDesserts"
