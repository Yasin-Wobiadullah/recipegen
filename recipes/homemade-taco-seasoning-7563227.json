Add 2 tablespoons taco seasoning and cook, stirring, until it smells lightly toasted. Add ground meat and cook, stirring and breaking up with a wooden spoon, until meat is evenly coated in taco seasoning and lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season with additional salt, to taste, if desired. Transfer to a serving bowl and keep warm.\nNotes\nCornstarch helps make ground beef juicier and less watery as it cooks. If you don\u2019t plan to use the taco seasoning for meat, then you can omit this ingredient.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe taco seasoning can be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry, dark place for up to 2 months.\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nThe Latest\nCondiments & Sauces",
