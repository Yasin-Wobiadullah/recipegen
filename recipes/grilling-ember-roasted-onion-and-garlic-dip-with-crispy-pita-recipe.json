  "full_text": "Ember-Roasted Onion and Garlic Dip with Crispy Pita Recipe | Grilling\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n40 mins\nCook\n50 mins\nTotal\n90 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the Dip:\n2\nmedium\nyellow onions (skin on)\n, cut in half through the stem\n4\nlarge\ngarlic cloves (skin on)\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n1\ncan (15 1/2 ounces)\ngarbanzo beans\n, rinsed\n1/2\ncup\nsour cream\n2\ntablespoons\nfresh lemon juice\n2\ntablespoons\nfinely chopped fresh dill\n3/4\nteaspoon\nground cumin\n3/4\nteaspoon\nWorcestershire sauce\n1/2\nteaspoon\nKosher salt\n1/4\nteaspoon\nfresh ground black pepper\n1/8\nteaspoon\nground cayenne pepper\n6\npita pockets\nDirections\nLight one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals out evenly.\nLay the onion halves, cut side down, on a 16-inch square of heavy duty aluminum foil. Nestle garlic cloves between the onions. Drizzle a couple tablespoons of olive oil over the onions and garlic. Fold up the sides of the foil and seal the packet. Place the packet directly on the coals, cover grill, and cook until a knife inserted into the foil slides through the onions with no resistance, about 20 to 30 minutes, carefully turning the packet once during cooking. Remove the packet with tongs and set aside to cool to room temperature.\nBrush the cooking grate clean. Lightly brush each pita on both sides with oil. Working in batches, grill pitas until crisp and toasted, 2 to 4 minutes, turning frequently and swapping positions as needed for even cooking.\nOpen the packet and remove and discard the skins and hard stems from the onions and garlic. Place roasted onions and garlic in a food processor and pulse until almost pur\u00e9ed. Add all of the remaining dip ingredients and process until quite smooth. Adjust seasonings, if desired. Cut each pita into wedges and serve with dip.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nMemorial Day Menus\nDips\nGrilling\nGarlic\nOnions"
