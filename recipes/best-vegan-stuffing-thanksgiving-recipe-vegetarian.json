Preheat oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Spread bread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger trays on oven racks and bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total, rotating trays and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and cool. Increase oven heat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\nPlace half of mushrooms in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until roughly chopped, about 8 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with remaining mushrooms. Place pecan halves in food processor (do not wipe out bowl) and process until roughly chopped, about 12 short pulses. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chopped mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until all moisture has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Add half of sage and continue to cook, stirring, until mushrooms are well browned, about 5 minutes longer. Add onion, leek, celery, garlic, and remaining sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Add stock, half of parsley, and chopped pecans and bring to a boil. Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTransfer mixture to a greased 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish (or 10- by 14-inch oval dish), cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until hot throughout, about 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown and crisp on top, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, large\nDutch oven\nor\nstockpot\n,\nlarge baking dish\nNotes\nThis recipe requires you to make a batch of\nhearty vegetable stock\nbefore beginning. I strongly recommend using the recipe instead of store-bought vegetable stock. When making your own stock, add any extra vegetable or mushroom trimmings for extra flavor. If keeping the dish vegan is not of concern to you, feel free to substitute\nhomemade\nor store-bought low-sodium chicken stock for the vegetable stock, butter for the olive oil, and add an egg along with the stock.\nThanksgiving Stuffings\nDairy-free Sides\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nRoasted Vegetables",
