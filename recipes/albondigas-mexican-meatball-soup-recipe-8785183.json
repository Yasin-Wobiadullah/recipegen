If the meat mixture is sticky in your hands, moisten your hands with water and continue rolling meatballs.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nGently add meatballs to boiling broth mixture. Reduce heat as needed to maintain a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Add potatoes and continue to simmer for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nAdd carrots, zucchini, and corn and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until meatballs are tender and reach an internal temperature of at least 165\u00b0F and vegetables are fork tender, about 10 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nDivide soup evenly among serving bowls and serve with cilantro and lime, if using.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender, large stock pot or Dutch oven\nNotes\nFor best results, buy freshly ground meat from a local butcher or grind your own. If grinding your own meat, use chuck roast and pork shoulder.\nIf Mexican oregano is unavailable you can substitute with fresh or dried Italian oregano.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Allow soup to cool to room temperature before storing. To reheat, microwave in a microwave-safe container or simmer in a saucepan on the stovetop until warmed through.\nSoups\nThe Latest\nMexican\nMeatballs"
