Set aside.\nPour oil into a 3-quart saucier or saucepan. Add potatoes, arranging them cut-side down in a single layer. Set saucier over medium-high heat and cook, uncovered, until potatoes are light golden-brown on cut-side, 5 to 6 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLower heat to medium-low, add soy sauce mixture and stir to combine with potatoes. Cover saucier with a lid, and cook until potatoes are completely tender and offer no resistance when pierced with a cake tester or paring knife, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRemove lid and increase heat to high. Cook, uncovered, stirring constantly with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, until liquid has reduced and thickened to a sticky caramel consistency that fully glazes the potatoes, 1 to 2 minutes.\nRemove from heat, and transfer potatoes to serving bowl. Drizzle with sesame oil, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier with lid\n,\nheat-resistant spatula\nNotes\nYou can use joseon ganjang (Korean soy sauce made from soy alone), yangjo ganjang (Korean soy sauce made from soy plus wheat), or even Japanese soy sauce here, if that's what you have. See our\nguide to the Korean pantry\nfor more on the most common varieties of Korean soy sauce.\nLook for potatoes that are about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. If you can't find small potatoes, cut larger Yukon Golds into 1 1/2-inch pieces.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nCelebrate the Sides With a Korean-American Banchan Thanksgiving\nKorean\nDairy-free Sides\nStovetop\nYukon Gold Potatoes\nVegetable Sides"
