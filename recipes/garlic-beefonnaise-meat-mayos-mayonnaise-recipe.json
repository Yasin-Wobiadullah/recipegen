  "full_text": "Garlic Beefonnaise Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nTotal\n10 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/4\ncup\nrendered beef fat\n, melted (see note)\n1 1/4\ncups\ncanola oil\n2\nlarge\negg yolks\n1\ntablespoon\nDijon mustard\n2\ntablespoons\nmayonnaise\n(optional, see note)\n1 to\u00a02\ncloves\ngarlic\n, grated on microplane grater or pressed through garlic press\n1\ntablespoon\nwater\n, plus more to correct consistency\nLemon juice\nto taste\nSalt and pepper to taste\nDirections\nCombine beef fat and canola oil in 2-cup liquid measuring cup. Whisk to combine.\nAdd egg yolks, Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, garlic, and water to bowl of food processor (see note). Run processor for 5 seconds to combine. Scrape down sides of processor bowl with rubber spatula. With processor running, slowly drizzle fat into bowl in a thin, steady stream, stopping and scraping down sides as necessary. Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste, and adjust consistency with water until thick, smooth, and creamy, but not mouth-coatingly waxy. Store in refrigerator in air-tight container for up to two weeks.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nNotes\nThis mayonnaise can be made with vegetable oil in place of the rendered animal fat - though flavor will suffer.\nFor insurance, I add jarred mayonnaise to the food processor at the start, which makes it easier to create a stable emulsion. If you are an experienced mayonnaise-maker who has no problems with mayonnaise breaking on you, you may omit the jarred mayonnaise.\nThe mayonnaise can also be made in a bowl with a whisk.\nRead More\nBaconnaise Recipe\nSpicy Duckonnaise Recipe\nSpicy 'Nduja Mayonnaise Recipe\nTwo-Minute Mayonnaise Recipe\nThe Food Lab Video Series: Emulsions\nHow to Fix a Broken Sauce or Vinaigrette\nCondiments & Sauces",
