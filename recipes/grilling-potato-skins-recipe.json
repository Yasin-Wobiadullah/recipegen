  "full_text": "Potato Skins Recipe | Grilling\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n30 mins\nCook\n50 mins\nTotal\n80 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nlarge\nrusset potatoes\n, scrubbed\n8\nounces\nbacon\n, chopped fine\n4\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n, melted\n8\nounces\ncheddar cheese, shredded\n1/2\ncup\nminced fresh\nscallions\n1/2\ncup\nsour cream\nKosher salt\nFreshly\nground black pepper\nDirections\nLight a chimney 3/4 full of charcoal. While the charcoal is lighting, thoroughly prick the potatoes with a fork. Microwave the potatoes on high for 8 minutes, turning them over after 4 minutes.\nWhen the charcoal is fully lit and covered in gray ash, pour the coals out and arrange them on either side of the charcoal grate, keeping the middle empty. Transfer the potatoes to grill, placing them in the middle of the grill, not over the coals, cover, and cook until a paring knife glides easily through the flesh, about 20 minutes. Remove from the grill, slice the potatoes in half lengthwise and let cool.\nWhile the potatoes are on the grill, cook the bacon in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate and set aside.\nWhen the potatoes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop out and discard the flesh, leaving and 1/4-inch layer of potato on the inside of each skin. Brush the potatoes inside and out with the melted butter and season with salt and pepper. Move the potatoes back to the middle of the grill, cover, and let cook until they're light golden brown and crisp, about 7 minutes.\nSprinkle the potato skins evenly with the cheddar cheese and bacon, cover, and continue to cook until the cheese is bubbly, about 7 minutes more. Remove from the grill, let cool for 5 minutes, then sprinkle with scallions and dollop with sour cream and serve.\nRusset Potatoes\nGluten-free Sides\nGrilled Vegetables\nCheddar Cheese\nBacon",
