In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, allspice, salt, and citrus zest. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together pumpkin and eggs. Whisk in spice mixture. Whisk in evaporated milk. Pour pumpkin mixture into baking dish and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and bake until mixture is just set (it will be slightly jiggly in the center but will firm as it cools), about 45 minutes. Let cool completely. Do not turn off the oven.\nFor cookie crumble\n: While custard is cooling, mix together cookie crumbs, dark brown sugar, salt, and flour. Add melted butter and mix until well coated. Press into bottom of pie dish and bake until cookies are toasted and fragrant and mixture holds together, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely.\nTo serve\n: Break up cookie crumble into large shards. Top each serving of custard with crumble and whipped cream, if desired. Store leftover custard in the refrigerator. Keep crumble separately at room temperature in an airtight container.\nNotes\nI used about 3/4th of a 29-ounce can of 100% pumpkin puree. For the cookie crumble, I used one 5.25 ounce package of Ana's Ginger Thins. Do not crush the cookies too finely\u2014you want them to be in about 1/4-inch chunks for texture. For extra garnish, add a topping of freshly whipped cream. You can also make the crumble alone to top a variety of custards, panna cotta, or ice cream.\nSpecial Equipment\n7- by 10 1/2- by 2-inch baking dish, 9-inch pie plate, mixing bowl\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCookie Monster: Pumpkin Custard With Cookie Crumble\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nBaking\nPumpkin\nFall Desserts",
