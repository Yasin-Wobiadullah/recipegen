Place trotters in a large stock pot with bay leaves, carrots, onions, garlic and peppercorns. Cover with water then bring to a simmer skimming foam off the top of the pot until trotters are tender (test with a knife) 2-3 hours. Remove trotters then strain liquid through a strainer. Reserve liquid.\nCover potatoes with water and bring to a simmer, cook until tender, then drain and mash. Add cream then season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow to cool to room temperature.\nWhen trotters are still warm but cool enough to handle, unwrap the cheese cloth and gently separate the halves. Remove all the bones from the trotter, trying to keep each half as intact as possible. If any bits of trotter fall off, reserve them. Season both sides of each trotter half with salt and pepper.\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Carefully unroll caul fat so that the thin sheets are separated and easy to handle. Place each trotter half skin side down on a cutting board then divide potatoes evenly between trotters. Roll trotter around potatoes, then gently wrap each trotter half with caul fat. Repeat with remaining trotters. Place wrapped trotter halves on rack in baking pan and roast until deep golden brown, about an hour.\nIn a large skillet cook bacon over medium high heat until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp, about 6 minutes. Add any bits of trotter that fell off while the bones were being removed and cook until beginning to brown. Add cabbage and cook until wilted, adding some of the pork stock leftover from cooking the trotters if anything begins to stick. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Once trotters are roasted serve alongside cabbage with plenty of dark beer.\nSpecial equipment\nlarge stock pot, roasting pan and rack, cheese cloth\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSunday Supper: Crubeens and Cabbage\nPork\nBritish\nCabbage\nPork Mains",
