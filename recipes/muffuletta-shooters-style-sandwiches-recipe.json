Cut around the perimeter of the interior crumb, making sure not to break through the bottom crust, then use your hand to lift out the excess bread from the inside, leaving you with a hollow bread boat.\nSerious Eats/J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nSpread half of olive salad along bottom of bread boat. Layer 1/3 or mortadella, 1/3 of sopressata, 1/3 of capicola, and 1/3 of provolone. Repeat cold cut and cheese layers 2 more times. Top with remaining olive salad and close sandwich.\nSerious Eats/J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nWrap sandwich tightly in aluminum foil or burtcher paper, then place in between 2 stiff cutting boards. Place a heavy weight on top (about 40 pounds), press down firmly to flatten sandwich, then let rest under the weight for at least 4 hours and up to overnight (keep an eye on the sandwich to ensure that it is pressing evenly).\nSerious Eats/J.
