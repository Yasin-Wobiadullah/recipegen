Working in batches if needed, place potatoes on microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power, flipping halfway through, until potatoes can be easily pierced with a paring knife, 12 to 14 minutes. (If they aren't ready, continue to microwave in 30-second increments until soft.) Let potatoes sit until cool enough to handle. Peel the potatoes and pass through a ricer into a medium bowl; set aside. (See notes if you\u2019d prefer to use a blender instead.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhile potatoes cook:\nIn a 6-quart pot, cook bacon over medium heat, stirring constantly, until bacon is crisp and fat is rendered, about 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons bacon fat from pot.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd onion and garlic to remaining bacon fat in pot and saut\u00e9 over medium heat until very soft but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add milk, season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a gentle simmer and cook until flavors meld, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nUsing an immersion blender, pur\u00e9e onion, garlic, and milk until smooth. Add riced potatoes and sour cream, stirring to combine, until soup is warmed through. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve. Garnish with sour cream, chives, cheddar, and potato chips, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nMicrowave, ricer, 6-quart pot, immersion blender\nNotes\nAlternatively, you can use a blender instead of a ricer. Peel cooked potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes, then proceed with step 2 of recipe. In step 4, add potatoes and sour cream to onion, garlic, and milk mixture. Pur\u00e9e using an immersion blender or transfer soup to a blender and begin blending on low (make sure to remove lid vent and cover with a clean kitchen towel before turning on blender to prevent a build-up of pressurized steam). Slowly increase speed to high and blend until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Return soup to pot, straining through a fine-mesh strainer if desired, and bring soup to a simmer over medium heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve. Garnish with sour cream, chives, cheddar, and potato chips, if desired.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nSoup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Once cooled, soup can be frozen for up to 1 month in an airtight container. To thaw, place in refrigerator overnight.\nRead More\nRoasted Garlic, Potato, and Parmesan Soup\nPotatoes\nThe Latest\nSoups",
