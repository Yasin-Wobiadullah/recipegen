Pur\u00e9e with an immersion blender until thick and smooth, then strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids with a flexible spatula until they give up all their liquid. Discard the fibrous oat solids, and reserve 2 ounces of the thick and gooey pur\u00e9e to use as directed below. This should not be done in advance, as the oat slurry will continue to thicken and become unusable over time.\nFor the Dough:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Combine refined coconut oil, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater as needed along the way.\nWith the mixer still running, dribble in the prepared oat slurry and continue beating until smooth. Shut off the mixer, and scrape the bowl and beater. Meanwhile, sift the flour into a medium bowl, then add the dry malt extract and whisk to combine, about 1 minute (if this mixture is not homogeneous, the cookies will have an irregular flavor and consistency, so take your time).\nResume mixing the slurry on low speed, then add the malt-flour all at once, followed by the chopped chocolate. Continue mixing only until well combined. Because coconut oil is solid below 76\u00b0F, the dough will seem crumbly and dry; in a hot kitchen, the dough may seem wet or oily, instead.\nPortion the Dough:\nWith a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, divide the dough into about 32 pieces, firmly compressing each portion into the scoop with the palm of your hand or the edge of the bowl. Arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between each. With the palm of your hand, gently press each portion to minimize its dome. This step is not meant to smash or flatten the cookie dough, but to create a slightly level surface. Sprinkle each with chopped chocolate and a pinch of salt.\nTo Bake:\nBake until the cookies are puffed and golden, but still quite steamy and soft in the middle, about 12 minutes. Due to the unique melting point of coconut oil, the cookies will seem doughy and raw in the middle, but they will become increasingly thick and firm as they cool. Cool directly on the baking sheet until the crumb is set, about 5 minutes. These cookies are best served fresh, or within 12 hours of baking, but leftovers can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion blender\n,\nnon-reactive sieve\n, stand mixer, flexible spatula, 2-tablespoon cookie scoop (optional), half sheet pans\nNotes\nWith kitchen temperatures above 74\u00b0F (23\u00b0C), start by refrigerating the mixing bowl and dry ingredients until cooled to 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). At elevated temperatures, these ingredients and equipment can act as a heat source, warming the dough and causing excessive spread in the oven.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Perfect Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies, One Ingredient at a Time\nCookies\nDairy-free Desserts\nVegan Desserts\nBaking\nChocolate"
