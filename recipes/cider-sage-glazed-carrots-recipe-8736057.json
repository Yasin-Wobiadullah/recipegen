  "full_text": "Glazed Carrots\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n30 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n6 tablespoons\n(75\ng)\nunsalted butter,\ncut into 6 pieces\nThree\n5-\ninch\nlong\nsage\nsprigs\n2\npounds\n(910g) medium\ncarrots,\npeeled and sliced on the bias into 1/2 inch\u2013thick discs\n1 cup (\n240\nml)\napple cider\n1/2\ncup\n(120ml)\nhomemade chicken stock\nor store-bought low-sodium\nchicken broth\nor vegetable broth\n3 tablespoons\n(45\nml)\nhoney\n1\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt,\nplus more to taste; for table salt use half as much by volume\n1/4\nteaspoon freshly\nground black pepper\n1\nteaspoon\napple\ncider vinegar,\nwhite wine vinegar, or unseasoned rice vinegar\n1\n-2\ntablespoons\nchopped fresh tender herbs such as flat-leaf\nparsley,\nchives, and/or tarragon\nDirections\nIn a deep 12-inch stainless-steel skillet, melt butter over medium heat, stirring often, until melted, about 2 minutes. Once melted, continue to cook, stirring constantly, just until milk solids separate and sink to the bottom of the skillet and begin to darken, 2 to 3 minutes. (Butter can go from brown to burnt quickly, so keep a close eye on it as you stir it.) Add sage sprigs; cook, stirring constantly, until sage leaves darken and crisp and butter foams and browns, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nQuickly add carrots, apple cider, chicken or vegetable stock, honey, salt, and pepper to brown butter in skillet. Carrots should be almost submerged, if not, add a small amount of stock until they are. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover, reduce heat to medium-high, and continue to boil, vigorously shaking the skillet occasionally, until carrots are a crisp/tender, and still firm in the center, about 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nReduce heat to medium, uncover (the liquid should look creamy and still almost cover the carrots) and continue to boil, vigorously stirring and shaking skillet often, until the mixture is reduced to a glaze that coats and clings to the carrots, 12 to 14 minutes. If the sauce begins to break and you see oily, butter-colored specks, add a splash of water (about 2 tablespoons) and return to a vigorous simmer, stirring constantly, until the mixture looks creamy and homogenous again.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nRemove from heat and discard sage sprigs. Stir in vinegar and season with salt to taste. Sprinkle with herbs. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch stainless-steel skillet\nNotes\nThis recipe can be doubled and cooked in 2 separate batches.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nGlazed carrots are best served immediately to keep the emulsified glaze intact, but leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\nTo reheat, bring carrots and 1/3 cup water or stock to a vigorous boil in a large skillet over medium-high, stirring often; simmer, shaking skillet and stirring constantly, until sauce is creamy and carrots are hot. Add additional water, 2 tablespoons at a time, if needed to re-emulsify the sauce.\nCarrots can also be reheated in the microwave in a covered dish\u2014the sauce might break, but the carrots will still be delicious.\nVegetable Sides\nCarrots\nFall\nChristmas\nThanksgiving",
