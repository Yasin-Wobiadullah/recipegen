  "full_text": "Risotto al Salto (Crispy Rice Pancake) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nTotal\n10 mins\nServes\n2\nto 4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2 1/2\ntablespoons\n(\n35\ng\n)\nunsalted butter\n2\ncups\nleftover risotto (\n475\ng\n), such as\nrisotto alla milanese\n, fully cooled\nFreshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\nor Grana Padano, for serving\nDirections\nLightly grease two flat 10- or 11-inch plates (you can use any oil for this, or even some extra butter). In a well-seasoned 10-inch carbon steel skillet or a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over high heat until foaming. Add rice and, using a spatula, pat it down to form a round pancake shape.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nContinue cooking over high heat, patting the top and sides to form a compact, pancake-like round, and swirling to keep the pancake moving and to avoid hot-spots (it should not stick), until very well browned on on the first side (you can tell it's ready when you see that it has browned around the edges). If the pancake comes apart as you swirl and jiggle it, simply use the spatula to press it back together.\nCarefully slide the pancake out onto one of the prepared plates, then invert the other prepared plate on top of it. In one very quick motion, flip the plates, then lift off the top plate. Very carefully slide the pancake back into the skillet; using the spatula to patch up any spots that were damaged during the flip. Continue cooking, swirling, jiggling, and patting with the spatula, until well browned on the second side.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCarefully slide the pancake out onto a warmed serving plate and grate cheese all over. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nYou need to use a skillet with sloped sides for best results; a straight-sided cast iron pan is not a good choice here, as it will make swirling and flipping the pancake very difficult.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch well-seasoned\ncarbon steel\nor nonstick skillet with sloped sides, two 10-inch plates\nRice & Grain Mains\nItalian\nStovetop\nRice & Grains\nQuick Dinners"
