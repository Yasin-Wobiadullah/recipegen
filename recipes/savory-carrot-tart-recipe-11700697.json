Arrange carrot rounds and lengths in a single layer, cut side down. Roast until carrots are tender and lightly browned at edges, about 25 minutes.

On a lightly floured work surface, use a rolling pin to roll puff pastry sheet into a 13- by 11-inch rectangle. Transfer to parchment-lined sheet. Using a pairing knife, lightly score a border around perimeter of puff pastry, about 1/2 inch from edges. Using a fork, prick pastry at 1-inch intervals inside the border (do not prick the border).\u00a0Loosely cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to bake.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nWhen ready to bake, arrange Brie slices in an even layer inside scored border of pastry.
