Refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours or up to 1 week. Churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions (see note). This ice cream can be frozen up to 1 month in an airtight container with a layer of plastic wrap pressed firmly against the surface.\nNotes\nMy Girmi ice cream maker churns this base into a full quart of ice cream. You can expect comparable results with other stand-alone machines from brands such as Cuisinart or Breville, but in my experience, stand mixer\u2013based attachments can yield as little as 3 cups.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nThis Recipe Appears In\nIf You Like Dulce de Leche, You'll Love This Three-Way Cajeta Sundae\nIce Cream"
