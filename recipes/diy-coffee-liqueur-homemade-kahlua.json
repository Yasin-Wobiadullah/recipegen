Let mixture steep 3 days, then remove vanilla bean and bottle liqueur.\nSerious Eats / Liz Clayman\nSpecial Equipment\nCoffee filter\nNotes\nWhen hot coffee cools down, it loses some of its good qualities. Cold brewing the coffee keeps bitter and overly acidic flavors from taking over.\nTurbinado sugar, also known as raw sugar, is available at most grocery stores. You can substitute other types of sugar if desired.\nIf rum isn't your favorite spirit, try vodka, brandy, or bourbon.\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines\nCoffee",
