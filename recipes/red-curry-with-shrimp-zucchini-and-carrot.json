Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables just start to soften, about 3 minutes.\nPour in the remaining coconut milk, and stir well. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer. If using jalape\u00f1os, add them now. Cook until vegetables are completely tender, about 7 minutes. Add shrimp and peas, and cook until shrimp are pink and plump, about 2 minutes.\nIn a medium sized bowl, stir together the fish sauce, chicken stock, and sugar. When sugar has dissolved, pour this into the skillet. Stir well and simmer for a minute. Turn off the heat, add cilantro, chopped mint, and lime juice. Serve the curry with the whole mint leaves as a garnish and a side of white rice.\nSoups\nStovetop Seafood\nCoconut Milk & Cream\nShrimp"
