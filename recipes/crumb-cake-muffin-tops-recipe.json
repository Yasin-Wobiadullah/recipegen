Grease muffin top pan.\nWhisk sugar, salt, melted butter, and oil in a large bowl. Whisk in egg, milk, sour cream, and vanilla. In a separate bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Stir into wet mixture until just combined.\nFor the crumb topping:\nWhisk flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl until combined. Add melted butter and vanilla, and toss with fingers until mixture forms moist crumbs.\nSpoon 2 tablespoons batter into each muffin top cup and spread evenly (see notes). Sprinkle with 1/2 of crumb mixture. Bake until light golden and cakes are just firm, about 15 minutes. Let cakes cool in pan 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter and crumbs.\nSpecial Equipment\n6 cup muffin top pan (or a\n8\" cake pan\nor\n12 cup muffin pan\n)\nNotes\nMuffin top pans differ depending on the brand. I used a muffin top pan that has six cups, each cup with a volume of 5 tablespoons. The batter in this recipe made exactly two batches, or 12 muffin tops total. Though I haven't tested it, you should be able to bake this batter in a standard size 12 cup muffin pan.\nRead More\nBlackberry Crumb Cake\nEasy One-Bowl Coffee Cake\nHow to Scale a Recipe for a Cake to Fit Any Pan\nLemon Ricotta Cake\nBreakfast & Brunch\nMuffins"
