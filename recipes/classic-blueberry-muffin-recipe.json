Prepare a nonstick or aluminum muffin pan by greasing lightly or lining with tinfoil or paper liners. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, coriander, nutmeg, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix at low speed to form a mealy powder, about 2 minutes. Add milk, eggs, and vanilla (if using), mixing briefly to form a thick batter.\nDrop a heaping tablespoonful (about 1 ounce, or 28g if you want to be mathematically precise) of plain dough into the bottom of each muffin cup. Fold blueberries into remaining dough, which will be extremely stiff. Divide evenly between each cup. If you like, top each muffin with sparkling sugar, about 1 teaspoon each or to taste. Bake until muffins are puffed and firm, about 25 minutes. Enjoy immediately and store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 1 day.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStandard muffin pan (see notes), liners (optional),\nstand mixer\nNotes\nFor muffins that are golden on the bottom and perfectly round on top, be sure to use a nonstick pan; more on the science behind that\nhere\n.\nMuffins\nBlueberry\nBreakfast & Brunch\nEaster\nMother's Day"
