Wash lids and rings and bring to a simmer in a separate, small saucepan of water. Turn off heat and allow jars, lids and rings to sit in hot water until you need them.\nPour cider into your largest heavy-bottomed, non-reactive pot. Insert chopstick into cider until it touches the bottom of the pot. Using a pen or a paring knife, mark or notch the chopstick at the level of the cider. Then, removing the chopstick from the pot, measure from your first mark (the cider level at the start) and the end of the chopstick (the bottom of the pot) and make a second mark or notch at the halfway point. Make a mark/notch at the 1/3 point as well. The marks on the chopstick will serve as visual cues to help you see how much your cider has reduced.\nBring cider to a boil over high heat and then reduce to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally until thoroughly reduced, 5-8 hours, depending on your stove. Check the cider level against your chopstick measurements regularly.\nCider is finished when it has reduced to one third of its original volume, and it coats the back of a spoon. When cider is finished, remove from heat and strain, in batches, through a paper coffee filter or a fine sieve strainer lined with a clean, dampened dishtowel.\nPour cider into prepared jars, leaving a quarter inch of headspace. Wipe the rims of the jar lids with a clean kitchen or paper towel and seal.\nPlace sealed jars back into the canning kettle. When all jars are added, make sure that the water level clears the jar lids by at least 1 inch. Add more water if necessary, and, over high heat, bring the water back up to a boil. Once the water boils, set a timer for 5 minutes.\nAfter 10 minutes, turn off heat, and allow jars to sit in water for 5 additional minutes. Then, using a jar lifter, remove jars to a cooling rack.\nOnce jars have reached room temperature, remove rings and test that all lids have sealed properly. If any have not sealed, store them in the refrigerator. Label and store sealed jars in a cool place out of direct sunlight.\nSpecial Equipment\nBoiling water canner, disposable wooden chopstick\nNotes\nTo learn more about the canning process, check out our\nbeginner's guide to canning\n.\nSyrup\nApple"
