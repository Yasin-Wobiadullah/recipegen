  "full_text": "Mexican-Style Flour Tortillas Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n60 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n45 mins\nResting Time\n75 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 30 mins\nServes\n12 tortillas\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n11\nounces\n(315g)\nall-purpose flour\n(about 2 1/2 cups), plus more for dusting\n2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n(\n8\ng\n); for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight\n2\nteaspoons\nbaking powder\n1\nteaspoon\nsugar\n1/2 cup\nlard\n(\n115\ng\n), melted\n3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons (\n220\nml\n)\nwhole milk\n, warmed to 125\u00b0F (50\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer\nDirections\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add flour, sea salt, baking powder, and sugar. Turn mixer to low speed and mix until dry ingredients are well combined, about 30 seconds. Turn off mixer, detach whisk, and use it to scrape down bowl to quickly incorporate any unmixed flour.\nAttach the paddle attachment. Turn mixer to low. Add half the lard in a slow stream, then turn mixer up to medium speed and slowly pour in the remaining lard until fat is incorporated and flour becomes crumbly but still soft and powdery to the touch.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nWith the mixer still at medium speed, add milk in intervals, pouring it steadily in 3-second additions followed by 3-second pauses to allow the milk to mix in. Repeat until all the milk has been added. Increase mixer speed to high and let run until dough is smooth and elastic, 3 minutes.\nUsing bench scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough into a clean medium mixing bowl, cover with plastic, and let rest at room temperature for at least 1 and up to 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Dust a work surface with flour. Turn dough out onto work surface and divide evenly into 12 portions (about 1 3/4 ounces, or 50 grams, each). Working with 1 dough portion at a time and keeping the rest covered with a clean kitchen towel to prevent drying, dust the dough portion, then gently roll it into a ball; transfer dough ball to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough portions, then wrap baking sheet tightly with plastic. Let stand 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nHeat a dry 10-inch cast iron pan over medium heat; make sure to have a plastic bag, clean kitchen towel, or tortilla warmer nearby to hold the cooked tortillas. Lightly flour the work surface once more. Working with one dough ball at a time and keeping the rest covered with plastic to prevent drying, place a ball on the work surface and sprinkle lightly with flour. Gently press the ball down with your palm to make a flattened puck shape.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nUsing a rolling pin and working from the center of the puck toward its top edge, gently roll out the dough ball, being careful not to roll past the top edge. Roll the rolling pin back toward the bottom edge, being careful not to roll past the bottom edge. Flip the dough over and rotate it 45 degrees clockwise. Dust with more flour, if needed, then repeat rolling process. Continue to flip, rotate, flour, and roll the dough until a roughly 8-inch round tortilla has formed.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nTransfer tortilla to preheated pan and let cook until tortilla begins to bubble, about 10 seconds. Continue cooking about 15 second longer, until brown spots have developed on bottom side, then flip tortilla and cook on second side until browned and blistered in spots, about 10 seconds, adjusting heat as necessary to lightly brown the tortilla without burning it. Place the tortilla in the plastic bag (or tortilla warmer or wrapped in the clean towel) to keep warm and prevent drying. Repeat the rolling and cooking process with the remaining dough balls. Use tortillas as soon as possible after cooking.\nSerious Eats / Jillian Atkinson\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\nrolling pin\n,\ncast iron skillet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe tortillas are best when made and consumed fresh.\nRead More\nEasy Nixtamalized Corn Tortillas\nDo Wheat-Enriched Corn Tortillas Bring Us the Best of Worlds?\nGluten-Free Flour Tortillas\nMexican\nBread\nStovetop\nTacos",
