Add onion (or shallots) and cook, stirring, until tender, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until water has released and evaporated, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook mushrooms, scraping up browned bits from bottom frequently, until darkened and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Stir in parsley and nutmeg, season with salt and pepper, and cook mushroom duxelles for 1 minute longer. Set aside, pressing plastic wrap against the surface to keep it from drying out.\nFor the Artichokes:\nFill a large bowl with water; halve and squeeze 2 lemons into it.\nIf using large artichokes:\nClean them down to the hearts, following the\nguidelines shown here\n.\nIf using small artichokes:\nTrim artichokes following\nRoman-Jewish artichoke guidelines shown here\n. Transfer cleaned artichokes to bowl of lemon water as you work, covering them with a clean kitchen towel to keep them completely submerged.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDrain artichokes. Using a spoon, stuff each artichoke with as much mushroom filling as will fit. Cut pancetta into strips just large enough to cover the top (mushroom-stuffed) side of each artichoke and lay them on top so that the mushroom filling is well covered; you may have some pancetta unused. Tie with kitchen twine to secure the pancetta. (Reserve any unused mushrooms duxelles for another use, such as a layer on a sandwich.)\nIn a 3-quart saut\u00e9 pan or saucier, combine diced pancetta and olive oil and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until pancetta has rendered some of its fat and is beginning to brown lightly, about 4 minutes.\nAdd onion, carrot, and garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until just starting to soften, about 4 minutes. Nestle stuffed artichokes and their stems on top, then add white wine and bring to a simmer; lower heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook for 4 minutes.\nAdd stock, season lightly with salt, and return to a simmer. Add herbs. Cover and cook at a gentle simmer until artichokes and other vegetables are tender enough to easily slide a fork through them, about 25 minutes (cooking time will vary depending on the age and size of artichokes; if liquid level ever gets too low, add a little more water).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDiscard herb bundle. Using a slotted spoon, transfer artichokes, onions, carrots, and garlic, to a serving plate and keep warm. Return cooking liquid to the heat and simmer until slightly syrupy and reduced to about 3/4 cup (175ml). Keep warm.\nRemove twine from artichokes, being careful to leave pancetta and mushroom stuffing in place. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, sear artichokes over medium-high heat, pancetta side down, until pancetta is browned and crispy. Return to serving platter.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhisk butter and minced parsley into reduced cooking liquid, season with salt and pepper, then pour sauce over warmed platter of vegetables. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart\nsaut\u00e9 pan\nor\nsaucier\n, 10-inch\nnonstick skillet\n,\nwhisk\nRead More\nClassic Artichokes\u00a0\u00e0 la Barigoule\u00a0(French Braised Artichokes With White Wine)\nCarciofi alla Romana (Roman Braised Artichoke Hearts)\nVegetables\nRecipes\nFrench\nSpring\nArtichoke",
