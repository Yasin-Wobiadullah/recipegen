In a large stockpot or large Dutch oven, add the pork shoulder, pig\u2019s feet, if using, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Add 2 1/2 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low and cook, covered, adjusting heat as needed and occasionally skimming any scum and fat that rises to the surface, until a richly flavored broth is created and pork is just beginning to turn tender, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nFor the Sauce:\nMeanwhile, in a high-walled stainless-steel skillet, toast chiles over medium-low heat until aromatic, turning occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of water, bring to a boil, then immediately turn off heat and soak chiles until softened, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nIn a blender, blend the chiles with their soaking water, garlic, onion, black peppercorns, cumin seeds, and chicken bouillon powder until smooth, about 1 minute. Season with salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nAfter the pork has cooked for 1 hour in step 1, add the hominy and pour the blended chile sauce into the pork and broth mixture through a fine mesh strainer. Continue to cook on low heat, covered, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer until pork is fork-tender (broth yield should be about 2 1/2 quarts), about 2 more hours. Discard pig\u2019s feet, onion, and bay leaves. Use a ladle to skim off any excess fat, if needed. Season to taste with salt.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nFor Serving:\nLadle into individual serving bowls and serve with toppings (onion, radish, cabbage, avocado, oregano, and lime juice) on the side to be added at the table. Tostadas can be shattered into the soup or slathered in crema and eaten on the side.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender, large stockpot or large Dutch oven, skimmer, fine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nCanned hominy can be found in the Mexican aisle of most well-stocked supermarkets.\nThis recipe can easily be doubled if; if doubling, you will need a very large stockpot, or need to cook in 2 separate batches.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe chile sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.\nPozole can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months.\nSoups\nThe Latest\nMexican\nPork",
