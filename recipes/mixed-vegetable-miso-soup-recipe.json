Remove kombu with tongs and discard or reserve for another use. (Kombu can be sliced thinly and tossed into a salad.)\nAdd katsuobushi to water and bring to a rolling boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let dashi stand 10 minutes.\nStrain dashi through a fine-mesh strainer set over a heatproof bowl; discard katsuobushi. Transfer dashi to a clean saucepan. In a small bowl, whisk both misos with just enough dashi to form a thin paste. Stir miso paste into dashi until incorporated.\nLadle dashi into warmed bowls, garnishing with radish, greens or stems, and pea shoots. Add a few drops of citrus juice to each bowl, if desired. Serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nThis recipe calls for a mix of two types of miso for more depth of flavor, but if you want to use just one, substitute 3 tablespoons\nawase\nmiso, which is a combination of\nshiro\n(white) and\naka\n(red) miso.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nPlumbing the Depths of Miso Soup\nSoups",
