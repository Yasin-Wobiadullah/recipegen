Season liberally on all sides, including edges, with salt, and place on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Let sit, uncovered, for at least 45 minutes or up to 3 hours (if you plan to cook the steak within an hour, you can leave it out at room temperature; otherwise transfer to refrigerator until you are ready to cook).\nWhen you are ready to cook the steak, use a sharp chef's knife or serrated knife to cut tomatoes into an assortment of slices, wedges, and bite-size pieces. Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on a large serving plate, and sprinkle lightly with coarse sea salt (if using).\nIn a 10- or 12-inch carbon steel, stainless steel, or cast iron skillet, heat oil over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Carefully add steak and cook, flipping every 20-30 seconds, until a golden-brown crust starts to develop, about 4 minutes total.\nSlide steak to back of skillet, and add butter to front of skillet. Once butter has melted and begun to foam, add shallots, garlic, and thyme sprigs (if using). Holding skillet handle with your non-dominant hand, tilt skillet so butter pools near base of handle. If butter begins to smoke excessively or steak begins to burn, reduce heat to medium. Use a large metal spoon to continuously baste butter and aromatics over steak, concentrating on areas where crust is less browned. Continue to baste steak, flipping every 20-30 seconds, until steak registers 120 to 125\u00b0F (49 to 52\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium, 1 to 2 minutes for medium-rare, 2 to 4 minutes for medium.\nImmediately transfer steak to serving platter with tomatoes, and let rest on top of tomatoes for 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pan juices, including aromatics, to a small bowl, stir in vinegar and fish sauce (if using), season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside. While steak rests, warm creamed shishitos in a small saucepan over medium heat until heated through, and transfer to a serving bowl. Transfer steak to a cutting board, slice against the grain into 1/2-inch-thick pieces, and arrange once again on top of tomatoes. Spoon brown butter-pan dripping dressing over the steak and tomatoes, and serve right away, passing creamed shishitos at the table.\nSpecial equipment\nCarbon steel skillet\n, or\n12-inch cast iron skillet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nThis recipe is designed for very large steaks, at least one and a half inches thick. This method works for both boneless and bone-in steaks. A boneless steak of this size should weigh between 16 to 22 ounces (450 to 625g), or 24 to 32 ounces (700 to 900g) with the bone in. Porterhouse, T-bone, ribeye, and New York strip steaks will all work as well. Avoid using tenderloin steaks, as they are likely to overcook.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe creamed shishitos can be made ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Gently reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a little cream as needed to achieve the proper consistency. The steak and tomatoes are best enjoyed immediately.\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop Beef\nRibeyes\nShishito Pepper\nTomato",
