Adjust flame to maintain temperature. Working in batches, add tortillas and fry, agitating with a metal spider, until edges just start to brown. Flip chips over and continue to cook until crisp and light golden brown. Transfer chips to a paper towel-lined tray, sprinkle with salt to taste, and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes to drain. Repeat with remaining batches. Set aside until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nTo make the chile:\nRoast poblano and cubanelle peppers directly over the flame of a gas stove, grill, or under a hot broiler, turning occasionally, until skin is completely charred and blackened all over. Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit until cool enough to handle, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove charred outer skin, then stem and seed peppers. Transfer to the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nPreheat broiler. Place tomatillos and jalape\u00f1o on a baking sheet, cut side down. Broil until tomatillos have charred and softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to food processor with peppers, along with any exuded liquid.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nHeat oil in a Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Season chicken all over with salt and pepper; place in Dutch oven, skin side down. Cook until skins have deeply browned and crisped, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until second side has browned, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a plate and pour out all but 1 tablespoon of fat from Dutch oven. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion has softened and lightly browned around the edges, about 5 minutes. Stir in cumin and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer to food processor with chiles and tomatillos and pulse until roughly pur\u00e9ed.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nReturn Dutch oven to high heat. Add chicken stock and scrape bottom of pan to release browned bits. Stir in chile mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Nestle chicken in sauce, cover, and cook until thickest part of thigh registers between 175-185\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate and let sit until cool enough to handle.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nWhile chicken is cooling, increase heat to medium-high heat and let sauce boil until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro and lime juice. Remove and discard chicken skins. Using hands, pull chicken from bone into thin shreds. Add chicken back to sauce and stir to combine. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper to taste.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nTo make the cheese sauce:\nPlace cheese in a medium bowl and toss with cornstarch until evenly coated. Transfer cheese to small sauce pan and add 1 cup evaporated milk. Place over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until melted and thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in pickled jalape\u00f1os and thin out with additional evaporated milk to desired consistency. For a smoother, shinier cheese sauce, blend with immersion blender or in standard blender for 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nTo make the avocado salsa:\nPlace avocados, garlic, crema, cilantro, and lime juice in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Process until completely smooth. Season with salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nTo serve:\nSpread single layer of chips out on large baking sheet or serving platter. Spoon on cheese sauce, chile, and avocado salsa. Top with another layer of chips and spoon on additional sauce, chile, and salsa. Top with diced onion, cilantro, radish, pepper slices, and cotija cheese. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven, food processor\nRead More\nThe Ultimate Vegan Fully Loaded Nachos\n37 Superbowl Snacks to Kick the Game Off Right\nEasy Pressure Cooker Pork Chile Verde\nNachos\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nFrying\nChicken Thighs\nGame Day"
