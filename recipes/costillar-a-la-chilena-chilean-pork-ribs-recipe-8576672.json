Transfer ribs and marinade to a large baking dish and add 1 cup (237ml) water. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 1 1/2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nRemove dish from oven and increase oven temperature to 375\u2109 F (190\u2103). Being careful of hot steam, remove foil and, using a spoon, baste the ribs all over with cooking liquid. Return ribs to oven and cook, uncovered, basting once halfway through, until a paring knife inserts easily into the meat with slight resistance, the ribs are tender but not falling off the bone, the cooking liquid is reduced, and the ribs are lightly browned, 30 to 45 minutes. Slice racks into 2- or 3-rib sections and serve.\nSerious Eats / Estudio Como\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge baking dish, large zipper-lock bag\nNotes\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe fully cooked ribs will keep well in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.\nPork Mains\nThe Latest\nRoasted Pork\nPork\nSouth American",
