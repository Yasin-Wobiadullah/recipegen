Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nFor the Chicken:\nSet a (6-quart) air fryer to 400\u00b0F and preheat for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together oil, brown sugar, salt, smoked paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dry mustard, and cayenne (if using) until all spices are coated in oil to form a paste. Rub the spice paste all over the chicken. (If you have\u00a0time, transfer chicken to a plate and refrigerate uncovered for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours before cooking.)\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nPlace chicken flat in the preheated air-fryer basket, spaced as evenly apart as possible to allow for air circulation. Cook until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 160\u00b0F, 10 to 13 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nFlip chicken over and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the prepared sauce over each thigh. Return to the air fryer and continue cooking until the sauce is glazy, edges are lightly charred, and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 175 to 180\u00b0F, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully transfer to a cutting board to let rest for at least 5 to 15 minutes before slicing. Serve with the remaining sauce.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nHow to Make This Recipe With Chicken Breasts\nIf cooking chicken breasts, use two (6- to 8-ounce each) boneless skinless breasts or two (10- to 14-ounce each) bone-in chicken breasts, starting with the breasts presentation-side down. In step 3, cook the chicken breasts until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 120\u00b0F (for boneless skinless breasts this will take 5 to 10 minutes, for bone-in breasts this will take about 15 minutes). Then sauce, flip and sauce the chicken again, and cook until it registers 160\u00b0F, 6 to 10 minutes.\nSpecial Equipment\nAir Fryer\nNotes\nSave the remaining chipotle in adobo for another use. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks or freeze for up to 3 months.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe spice rub and the sauce can be made and stored separately in airtight containers for up to 7 days.\nThe cooked chicken can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days.\nQuick Dinners\nThe Latest\nChicken\nAmerican\nChicken Mains",
