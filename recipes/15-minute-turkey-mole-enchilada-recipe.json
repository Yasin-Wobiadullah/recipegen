Add 1 1/2 ounces of turkey meat. Roll tightly into a cigar shape and rest on seam side. Repeat with remaining tortillas and turkey.\nHeat oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium. Add enchiladas seam-side-down in a single row (you may have to work in batches). Cook without moving until crisp on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn with tongs or a slotted spatula and cook on second side until crisp.\nRemove from pan and drain on paper towels. Season with salt immediately. If cooking in batches, cooked enchiladas can be held in a 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C) oven while you cook the second batch.\nTo serve, spread half of sauce on a plate. Top with enchiladas and spoon remaining sauce on top. Drizzle with crema. Sprinkle with cotija, onions, and cilantro. Serve immediately with lime wedges.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet\nNotes\nYou can use store-bought mole or any other enchilada-style salsa for this dish, such as this\nsalsa verde\n. Mexican crema can be found in Latin markets or most large supermarkets. If unavailable, combine 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream in a small bowl and whisk together. Season with salt.\nRead More\nMole Poblano\nBasic Salsa Verde (Mexican Tomatillo Salsa)\nTurkey\nMexican\nStovetop\nTurkey Mains\nQuick Dinners",
