In a medium saut\u00e9 pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over low heat, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until the onion has wilted and started to turn translucent, 8 to 10 minutes; be careful not to let it brown. Add the red wine vinegar to the pan and shake briefly to coat onions, then transfer onion mixture to the bottom of an 8- by 12.25-inch baking dish.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nWipe the pan with a paper towel to clean it, then place it back over low heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil; heat until shimmering, about 5 minutes. Add the anchovy paste and, using a wooden spoon, stir to dissolve the paste into the oil, about 1 minute. Dump the breadcrumbs into the pan and stir to completely coat them with the oil, about 15 seconds. Transfer the breadcrumbs to a small bowl to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nAdd herbs to the bowl with breadcrumbs, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nLay the fish on top of the onions and season fish with salt and pepper. Distribute the breadcrumb-herb mixture evenly on top of the fish. Add the white wine or water to the pan and scatter the olives around the dish.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nBake the fish until opaque and flaky but still moist, 15 to 20 minutes; check the pan after 10 minutes and add a bit more water or wine if dry.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nServe immediately, with onions, olives and pan juices spooned alongside the fish.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nSpecial Equipment\n8- by 12.25- inch baking dish\nCod\nItalian\nRoasted Seafood\nSeafood Mains\nEaster",
