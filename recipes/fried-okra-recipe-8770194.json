Transfer to a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nFor the Fried Okra:\nIn a large bowl, whisk buttermilk and hot sauce to combine. Add okra and toss to evenly coat.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nFill a large Dutch oven with 1 1/2 inches of oil and heat oil over medium-high to 350\u00baF (175\u00baC).\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nMeanwhile, in a shallow bowl, whisk cornmeal, flour, cornstarch, and Creole seasoning to combine. Working in batches, dredge okra in flour mixture, tossing and pressing gently to adhere. Shake off excess flour and transfer okra to a rimmed baking sheet, arranging them in a single layer.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nLine a separate 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with 2 layers of paper towels; set aside. Carefully add 1/3 of dredged okra to oil, and fry, using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon to gently stir to prevent sticking, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer okra to prepared baking sheet and sprinkle evenly with salt. Let oil return to 350\u00b0F (175\u00baC), and repeat with remaining okra in two more batches. Serve with comeback sauce.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nVariation\nFor a slightly spicier comeback sauce, substitute the chili sauce for chili-garlic sauce (such as Huy Fong) and reduce chopped onion to 1 tablespoon. Proceed with remainder of step 1.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor, large Dutch oven, 2 rimmed baking sheets, instant read or deep-fry thermometer, spider skimmer or slotted spoon\nMake-Ahead and Storage:\nComeback sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nThe okra can be dredged and frozen in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet, then transferred to an airtight container and frozen for up to 2 months. Fry from frozen and add 30 seconds to 1 minute to the frying time for each batch, if necessary.\nFried okra are best eaten immediately, but in a pinch you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and reheat them in an air fryer.\nOkra\nThe Latest\nSoul Food & Southern\nSummer Snacks & Appetizers\nSummer Sides",
