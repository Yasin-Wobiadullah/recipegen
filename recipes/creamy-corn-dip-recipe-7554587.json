Using your fingers, break up the cream cheese into dollops and evenly distribute around the bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nIn a large bowl, combine the corn, feta, half-and-half, and red onion with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, oregano, garlic, red pepper flakes, and a generous grinding of black pepper. Using a silicone spatula, scrape the mixture into the baking dish over the cream cheese.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nTransfer baking dish to oven and bake until the cream cheese has softened, 15 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and use the silicone spatula to stir the cream cheese into the corn mixture until fully incorporated, making sure to scrape up all the cream cheese from the bottom and corners of the dish. Return baking dish to the oven and continue to bake until the dip begins bubbling around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nRemove the dish from the oven and, using the spatula, stir the dip together again. Season to taste with salt to taste, if needed, and top with olives, tomatoes, mint, and the remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil. Serve with crackers or pita chips.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\n8-inch square baking dish or other 2-quart capacity oven-safe dish, silicone spatula\nNotes\nBecause different varieties of feta have different salinities, there\u2019s no measured additional salt in this recipe. Taste the baked dip and season as needed before adding the fresh toppings.\nPit-in olives are often better-quality than pre-pitted ones; we recommend buying pit-in olives and removing the pits yourself.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can assemble the dip, cover the dish, and refrigerate it for up to 2 days before baking. When ready to cook, increase baking time to 45 minutes. Once baked and cooled, dip can be reheated in either the oven or microwave until hot in the center.\nCorn\nThe Latest\nCheese\nFeta Cheese\nSummer"
