Drizzle 4 tablespoons of egg mixture into flour and pinch with fingers until combined.\nRemove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to buttermilk mixture and turn to coat. Working one piece at a time, allow excess milk mixture to drip off then transfer to flour mixture. Turn to coat, pile extra mixture on top of thigh, and press down firmly to adhere as much mixture as possible to the meat. Lift thigh, shake off excess flour, then transfer to a rack set in a tray and let rest for 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, preheat oil to 350\u00b0F in a large wok, deep fryer, or Dutch oven.\nCarefully lower chicken into hot oil and cook, turning thighs occasionally until golden brown and crisp on all sides, and chicken is cooked through, about 6 minutes total.
