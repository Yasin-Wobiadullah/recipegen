Remove the chicken, and pat dry. Reserve the wine.\nIn a medium saucepan, cook pancetta over medium heat until just starting to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the shallots reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally until shallots are soft, about 2 1/2 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds longer. Add the reserved wine and porcinis, and bring to a boil. Add the ketchup, mustard, sugar, vinegar, thyme, and bay leaf. Cook over low heat until the mixture is thick and coats a spoon, about 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaf, and pur\u00e9e mixture in the blender until smooth, about 30 seconds. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nPreheat a cast iron grill pan or a grill to medium heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and toss in about 1/3 of the barbecue sauce. Lightly oil the hot grill and cook chicken turning once, until breasts register 155\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer and legs register 165\u00b0F, about 30 minutes. If chicken skin begins to burn, reduce heat and continue cooking. Remove chicken from grill as it reaches temperature and tent with foil to keep warm. Allow chicken to rest for 5 minutes, then serve.\nSpecial equipment\ngrill pan or grill\nChicken Mains\nGrilled Chicken"
