  "full_text": "French in a Flash: Drunken Angel Hair with Leeks and Cream\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n40 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\nsmall\nto\nmedium\nleeks\n, whites and light greens sliced into julienne\n1\ntablespoon\nbutter\n1/4\ncup\nwater\n, plus extra if needed\n3/4\ncup\nwhite wine\n1\npound\nangel hair pasta\n1/2\ncup\nheavy cream\n1/4\ncup\ngrated parmesan\n1\ntablespoon\nchervil\n, chopped\nSalt\nand\nfreshly cracked black pepper\nDirections\nIn a wide, preferably nonstick saut\u00e9 pan, melt the butter in 1/4 cup water on medium-high heat. Add the leeks and cover with a lid, lowering the heat all the way down. Cook until soft and spaghetti-like, about 20 minutes, adding water whenever the pan gets too dry, to avoid burning the leeks, and conversely evaporating off any extra liquid once the leeks are soft and sweet.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Add all the wine in the bottle except 3/4 cup, and a handful of coarse salt. Add the angel hair to the boiling water and wine, and cook until al dente, just a few minutes.\nIn the pan with the leeks, add 1/2 cup of wine, and allow to reduce slightly. Add the cream, and heat through. Add the cooked angel hair and some pasta water, and toss the pasta to incorporate. I like to add the final 1/4 cup of wine \"raw\" so that the alcohol is still palatable, but that's your choice. You just want enough wine and pasta water to create a sauce from the leeks and the cream that lightly coats the angel hair. Add a lot of freshly cracked black pepper, and the Parmesan and chervil. Voila! All done.",
