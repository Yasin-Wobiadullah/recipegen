Toss sweet potato with 4 tablespoons vegetable oil and salt. Spread sweet potato on 2 rimmed baking sheets and bake for 1 hour, rotating pans front to back and top to bottom halfway through cooking. Increase oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and cook until sweet potatoes are tender and lightly browned around the edges, about 25 minutes.\nIn a large pot, heat remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add carrot, onion, garlic, sage (if using), and a generous pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until vegetables are just tender.\nAdd sweet potatoes and stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes until vegetables are very tender. Discard sage, if using. Add orange juice. Using an immersion blender or countertop blender, blend soup until smooth. Season with salt.\nIf desired, pass soup through a fine-mesh strainer using a rubber spatula to plunge and scrape it through (it may not seem like it at first, but almost all of the soup will pass through).\nIn a mixing bowl, stir together pistachios, orange zest, scallions, mint, and cayenne pepper. Fold in olive oil and season with salt.\nServe soup, spooning pistachio salsa on top.\nSpecial Equipment\n2\nrimmed baking sheets\n,\nimmersion blender\nor\ncountertop blender\n;\nfine-mesh strainer\n(optional);\nmortar and pestle\nor\nfood processor\nNotes\nIf you choose to strain the soup through a fine-mesh strainer, thin soup to desired consistency with extra stock or water if necessary.\nSweet Potatoes\nSoups\nVegetarian\nFall\nVegan",
