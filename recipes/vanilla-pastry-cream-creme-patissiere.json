  "full_text": "How to Make Pastry Cream (Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re Recipe)\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nSteeping and Chilling Time\n3 hrs\nTotal\n3 hrs 20 mins\nServes\n18\nto 20 portions\nMakes\n2 1/2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\ncups\n(\n455\ng\n)\nwhole milk\n1\nvanilla bean\n, split and scraped (see note)\n4\nounces\ngranulated sugar\n(\n1/2\ncup;\n115\ng\n), plain or\ntoasted\n1\nounce\n(\n3\ntablespoons\n;\n30\ng\n)\ncornstarch\n1/4\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\nYolks\nfrom\n4\nlarge\neggs, straight from the fridge (\n2 1/2\nounces\n;\n70\ng\n)\n1\nounce\nunsalted butter\n(\n2\ntablespoons\n;\n30\ng\n), cut into 1/2-inch cubes\nDirections\nIn a 2-quart stainless steel saucier, combine milk and scraped vanilla bean along with its seeds. Bring to a bare simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat, cover to prevent evaporation, and let steep for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large bowl, set up an ice bath by partially filling it with a combination of cold water and ice. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a medium heatproof mixing bowl set on top of a dampened towel (this serves as a stable base), stir together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk in egg yolks until mixture is pale yellow, smooth, and fluffy, about 1 minute.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUncover infused milk and remove vanilla bean (see note). While whisking continuously, slowly pour milk into egg yolk mixture in a thin stream, until all of it has been added.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReturn the mixture to the same saucier. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly until pastry cream begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Once it thickens, continue to whisk, pausing every few seconds to check for bubbles, about 1 minute. When it begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for 1 minute. This step is important to neutralize a starch-dissolving protein found in egg yolks.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nOff-heat, whisk in butter until melted and thoroughly combined. Strain pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve set over a heatproof medium bowl. Immediately place plastic wrap or buttered parchment paper directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Transfer bowl to prepared ice bath to chill for 30 minutes, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen ready to use the pastry cream, whisk until smooth.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n2-quart stainless steel saucier\n,\nballoon whisk\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nI prefer Tahitian vanilla beans for their light, fruity-floral flavor, but you can use any variety of vanilla bean. Plus, you can reserve the used vanilla bean for\nother applications\n.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPastry cream can be stored in an airtight container, with plastic wrap or buttered parchment paper placed directly on the surface, and refrigerated for up to 3 days.\nRead More\nCr\u00e8me L\u00e9g\u00e8re Recipe\nCr\u00e8me Anglaise Recipe\nCream Puffs Recipe\nFlan P\u00e2tissier (French Custard Tart)\nBoston Cream Pie Recipe\nBanana Cream Pie Recipe\nChoux au Craquelin Recipe\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nPastries\nStovetop"
