Seal and shake. Let mixture steep for 3 days at room temperature away from direct sunlight. Strain fruit out, pressing down to extract liquid. Then, filter mixture through a coffee filter or through two layers of cheesecloth.\nCombine sugar and water in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Let syrup cool.\nOnce the syrup is cool, combine it with the melon infusion (see note). Seal in bottle or jar, then shake to mix. Let rest for a minimum of one day. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer, cheesecloth or coffee filter, resealable bottle or jar\nNotes\nDo not use frozen melon for this liqueur; even when it has been properly defrosted it seems to dilute the flavor.\nIf you would like a less-sweet liqueur, start by using only half the suggested sugar and water. Let the mixture rest a day, then sample and add more simple syrup to taste.\nRead More\nDIY Strawberry Liqueur\nDIY Peach Liqueur\nPimm's Melon Punch\nFresh Cantaloupe Margaritas\nVodka\nMelon"
