Strain through a fine-mesh strainer set over a resealable container and discard cinnamon sticks. Refrigerate shrub for at least 1 hour and up to 1 week.\nFor the Pitcher Cocktail:\nCombine rye and 12 ounces shrub together in a 1 1/2\u2013 or 2-quart pitcher and stir well to mix. Pour about 3 ounces (90ml) into each julep cup or rocks glass. Fill with crushed ice. Garnish each glass with a mint sprig (and cinnamon stick, if desired) plus 3 cranberries or red currants, and a straw.\nSpecial equipment\nSaucepan,\nfine-mesh strainer\n, 1 1/2\u2013 or 2-quart pitcher, straws for serving\nNotes\nIf you're not a fan of rye, try cognac; it makes a satiny-smooth, easy-drinking version of the punch. If you'd prefer to mix drinks individually, just combine two parts rye to one part shrub and mix well together before adding crushed ice.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nWhiskey + Easy Cranberry Shrub = Your Holiday Pitcher Cocktail\nWhiskey\nCranberry\nWinter Drinks"
