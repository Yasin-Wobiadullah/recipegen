Cut each jalape\u00f1o into two equal pieces.\nSerious Eats\nBreak off a ball of sausage about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Flatten sausage into a 1/4-inch thick disc and place stuffed-jalape\u00f1o piece in the center. Wrap sausage around jalape\u00f1o, pinching sausage closed to completely encase jalape\u00f1o. Gently roll sausage in your hands to create a smooth egg shape. Repeat with remaining sausage and jalape\u00f1os.\nSerious Eats\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil the grilling grate\n. Place smoking wood directly on top of coals. Sprinkle barbecue rub all over armadillo eggs, then place eggs on cool side grill and cover, with top air vent positioned over cool side of grill. Cook until sausage is cooked through and browned all over, about 30 minutes, flipping eggs halfway through. Any eggs not thoroughly browned can be quickly seared on hot side of grill, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a platter, let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then serve.\nSerious Eats\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\nHors D'Oeuvres\nGrilling\nCheese\nSausages\nJalapenos"
