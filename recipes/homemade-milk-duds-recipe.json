In a 2-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water, sugar, and salt over medium heat. Stir with a fork until sugar is fully dissolved and syrup comes to a rolling boil, about 4 minutes. Simmer, without stirring, until syrup is honey-gold, roughly 7 minutes. Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low, adjusting the heat lower if needed to keep caramel from foaming too high. (This is more likely on an electric stove due to residual heat.) Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula, simmer until caramel registers 260\u00b0F (127\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer, about 7 minutes. Immediately pour into prepared pan, cover tightly with foil, and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.\nPeel caramel from parchment, transfer to a cutting board, and cut into 50 pieces (approximately 1/4 ounce or 7g each) with a sharp knife; don't worry about being too precise with their shape or size. If you like, use your fingers to mold the pieces into a more oval, Milk Dud\u2013like shape.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Chocolate Coating:\nLine a baking sheet with parchment. Temper chocolate according to one of the methods described\nhere\n. Fold all caramel pieces into tempered chocolate. With a clean hand, scoop up pieces like handfuls of marbles, then slide each one over your index finger with your thumb into your other hand (think of how you'd dole out a handful of M&M's) and arrange on prepared baking sheet. Let stand at room temperature until fully set, about 15 minutes, then transfer to an airtight container.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n8-inch\nanodized aluminum cake pan\n(round or square), 2-quart stainless steel\nsaucier\n,\nheat-resistant spatula\n,\ndigital thermometer with clip-on attachment\nNotes\nFor the most authentic flavor, choose a dark chocolate with 65 to 72% cocoa solids. Brands like Callebaut or Valrhona are easiest to temper, but any high-quality chocolate made with real cocoa butter will do.\nRead More\nHomemade Butterfingers\nChocolate-Coated Caramel Honeycomb With Salted Peanuts\nPastillas de Leche (Filipino Milk Candies)\nSmoked Salt Caramels\nBoozy Caramel Bonbons\nCandy\nChocolate\nEaster"
