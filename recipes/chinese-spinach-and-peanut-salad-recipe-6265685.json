  "full_text": "Chinese Spinach and Peanut Salad\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n15 mins\nCooling Time\n10 mins\nTotal\n35 mins\nServes\n2 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\n(\n3 1/2\nounces\n;\n100\ng\n)\nraw skin-on peanuts\n, soaked in cold water for at least 10 mins, then drained and dried\n1/2\ncup\n(\n120\nml\n)\nneutral-flavored oil\n, such as peanut, canola, soybean, or vegetable\n1\nteaspoon\n(\n3\ng\n) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight\n1\npound\n(\n450\ng\n)\nspinach\n, thick stems trimmed and thoroughly washed in several changes of water of any sand or grit (see note)\n1\ntablespoon\n(\n15\nml\n)\nChinese light soy sauce\n1\ntablespoon\n(\n15\nml\n)\nseasoning oil\nfrom the\nChinese all-purpose vinaigrette recipe\n1\nteaspoon\n(\n5\ng\n)\nChinese Zhenjiang (black) vinegar\n4\ng\ngranulated sugar\n3\nmedium cloves\n(\n6\ng\n) finely minced peeled\nfresh garlic\nDirections\nIn a small saucepan, cover the peanuts with oil. Set over medium heat and cook, slowly bringing the oil up to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and then holding it there, until the peanuts are golden, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peanuts to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain, then transfer to a large metal bowl. Toss the peanuts with the salt and let cool.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a large bowl, prepare an ice bath. In a large pot of salted boiling water, blanch spinach until just tender and cooked through, about 30 seconds. Using a spider, quickly transfer spinach to ice bath, stirring to chill rapidly. Drain spinach, then wrap in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze to express any excess water. Cut spinach into 2-inch lengths.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, seasoning oil, vinegar, and sugar until well combined.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhen ready to serve, combine spinach, peanuts, minced garlic, and vinaigrette. Serve cold.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nThis salad can be made with any variety of mature (i.e., not baby) spinach. Amaranth and hearty leafy greens, including kale, chard, and j\u00ecc\u00e0i (shepherd\u2019s purse), would all also be good.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe vinaigrette can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week. The dressed salad can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 3 days, but will gradually lose its vibrant color.\nSpinach\nChinese\nPeanuts\nThe Latest",
