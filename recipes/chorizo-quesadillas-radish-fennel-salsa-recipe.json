Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nFor the Quesadillas:\nIn a large cast iron skillet or on the flat side of a cast iron griddle, heat 1/2 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add chorizo and cook until browned, turning once, about 3 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon onto a paper towel\u2013lined plate.\nSet out 4 tortillas on a work surface and sprinkle approximately 1 ounce (28g) cheese over half of each tortilla. Scatter chorizo and scallions on top of cheese, then top with remaining cheese. Fold tortillas in half over filling to form a half-moon shape.\nAdd remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to skillet or griddle and heat over medium-high heat until lightly smoking.\nAdd quesadillas to skillet or griddle in a single layer, working in batches if necessary. Cook until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Flip quesadillas and cook until second side is crisp and cheese is fully melted, about 3 minutes. Add more oil as needed if working in batches. While cooking any remaining batches, keep finished quesadillas warm by arranging them on a baking sheet in a single layer and holding them in a 250\u00b0F oven.\nCut quesadillas into wedges and serve with radish and fennel salsa.\nNotes\nTo save time, you can use pre-shredded cheese.\nStovetop\nCheese\nSausages\nFennel\nRadishes"
