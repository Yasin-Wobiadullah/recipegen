Place over medium heat and stir with a fork until bubbling hard around the edges, about 5 minutes. With a damp pastry brush, wipe all around the sides of the pot to wash down any visible sugar crystals. Clip a digital thermometer to the pot and cook the amber syrup until it registers 234\u00b0F (112\u00b0C), about 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nImmediately\nstir in the baking soda with a heat-resistant spatula (the syrup will bubble vigorously), followed by the remaining portion of water. Continue cooking until the syrup returns to 234\u00b0F (112\u00b0C), about 2 minutes longer. Pour into a Pyrex measuring cup to halt cooking, then stir in butter and vanilla. Cool to a safe eating temperature, about 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C), and serve. Cover leftovers as soon as possible to prevent syrup from forming a skin and refrigerate up to 3 months in an airtight container.\nSerious Eats/ Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n1-quart stainless steel pot, pastry brush, digital thermometer, heat-resistant spatula\nNotes\nYou'll be surprised at how intense a touch of dark brown sugar can be, so don\u2019t add more than a half ounce until you\u2019ve made a batch for yourself. For light brown sugar, you\u2019ll need about three times as much to get the same malty flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nDIY syrup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 months, although minor crystallization may occur.\nRead More\nFresh Lemon Syrup\nFresh Pineapple Syrup\nButtermilk Vanilla Waffles\nLight and Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes\nSyrup",
