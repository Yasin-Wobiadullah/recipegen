Season pork roast liberally with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, mix together smoked paprika, brown sugar, and garlic powder. Rub spice mixture all over pork.\nPlace pork on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to oven and roast until internal temperature reaches 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C), about 2 hours. Remove from oven and tent with foil for at least 15 minutes and up to 45 minutes.\nIncrease oven temperature to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil and cook parsnips and carrots until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain well. In a large bowl, toss parsnips, carrots, radishes, and turnips with just enough olive oil to coat. Arrange in a single even layer on 2 rimmed baking sheets and/or a large baking dish or roasting pan and roast until vegetables are browned and tender, about 25 minutes.\nReturn roast to oven and cook until crisp and browned on the exterior, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven, tent with foil, and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Return vegetables to bowl, drizzle lightly with fresh olive oil, and toss with parsley, lemon zest, and ginger. Season with salt and pepper.\nCarve roast by slicing between each rib. Serve with roasted vegetables and tapenade sauce.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nwith rack,\ninstant-read thermometer\n, baking dish, and/or\nroasting pan\nPork Mains\nRoasted Pork\nPork Loin\nFall Mains\nChristmas Dinners"
