Pulse 20 times, stopping to scrape down the sides every few pulses for even mincing. Transfer minced shrimp to a large bowl.\nAdd egg white, scallion, white pepper, salt, cornstarch, and Shaoxing wine to the shrimp. With chopsticks or a fork, mix in a circular motion until combined. Using wet hands, form shrimp paste into 2-inch balls and set on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate until ready to cook in hot pot.\nFor the Ginger-Scallion Sauce:\nIn a small saucepan, heat peanut or olive oil over medium heat for 1 minute. Add ginger and cook for 1 minute, then stir in scallions. Continue stirring and cook until scallions begin to wilt, about 2 minutes. Turn off heat and add salt, white pepper, and sesame oil. Serve right away or at room temperature.

In a small saucepan, heat peanut or olive oil over medium heat for 30 seconds. Drizzle hot oil all over scallions, chile, ginger, and cilantro.\nStir in soy sauce, vinegar, and hot chili oil. Let stand at room temperature until vegetables are slightly wilted, at least 15 minutes. Serve at room temperature.\nFor the Broth:\nBring water or chicken stock to a boil in the hot pot. Stir in BullHead sauce, fish sauce, and sugar. Season with salt. Add lime juice to taste.\nFor Serving:\nKeep broth in hot pot at a simmer. Arrange various raw ingredients for dipping (including shrimp balls, if using; thinly sliced meats; fresh seafood; mushrooms and other vegetables; and noodles) on plates. Arrange plates on table around hot pot. Dip ingredients into simmering broth until just cooked, then dip into one of the dipping sauces and enjoy.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n;\ninduction\n, electric, or butane burner for hot pot; hot pot divided pot;\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nThe shrimp balls are a delicious homemade choice, but entirely optional. Feel free to omit them, supplementing with other dipping ingredients, if desired.\nChinese\nBraising & Stewing\nBeef\nChicken\nLamb",
