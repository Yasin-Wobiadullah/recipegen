Cover with 6 cups (1.4L) cold water. Stir to dissolve salt and baking soda. Let stand at room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse chickpeas thoroughly.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nPlace chickpeas in a large Dutch oven or saucepan. Add remaining baking soda, 1 tablespoon (12g) salt, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Add 6 cups (1.4L) water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover with lid slightly cracked, and cook until chickpeas are completely tender and nearly falling apart, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Check on chickpeas occasionally and top up with more water if necessary; they should be completely submerged at all times. Let cool slightly. Discard onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Drain chickpeas, reserving their cooking water.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn a mixing bowl, combine tahini sauce with chickpeas and parsley. Stir, mashing some of the chickepas into the tahini until thoroughly mixed and chickpeas are coated in a creamy, thickened sauce. (If you prefer the sauce thinner, gently work in a little of the reserved cooking liquid.) You can refrigerate the hummus at this point; it will become thicker in the refrigerator.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpoon onto a serving dish, drizzle with olive oil, and top with garnishes of your choice. Serve with warm pita bread.\nMiddle Eastern\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nStovetop\nChickpeas\nSesame & Tahini"
