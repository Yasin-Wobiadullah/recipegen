Add buttermilk, melted butter, egg whites, and vanilla extract and whisk until smooth.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Waffles:\nSet waffle iron to medium and preheat until indicator is ready. For an 8-inch square machine, scrape in roughly half the batter. For a 7-inch Belgian machine, scrape in about one-third. Close lid and cook until waffle is golden brown but still steaming, 4 1/2 to 6 minutes depending on the depth and heat of your machine. Serve immediately, with copious amounts of maple syrup, and griddle remaining batter as before.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk\n,\nflexible spatula\n,\nwaffle iron\nNotes\nFrom size and depth to heat settings and materials (cast iron versus nonstick), waffle irons vary considerably from brand to brand; a small test waffle is a low-risk way to determine how the batter behaves on your machine.\nIn place of buttermilk, this recipe can be made with a 50/50 blend of plain, nonfat Greek yogurt and milk. You can also make this recipe without the vanilla bean, but the waffles won't be as aromatic.\nRead More\nBacon, Cheese, and Scallion Waffles\nWhat to Do With Leftover Buttermilk\nWaffles\nMother's Day\nButtermilk\nEaster\nFather's Day"
