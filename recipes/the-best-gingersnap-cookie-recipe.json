Mix on low to moisten, increase to medium, then beat until fluffy, pale tan, and soft, about 5 minutes. Add egg and beat until smooth, 2 minutes more, pausing to scrape as needed. Resume mixing on low, sprinkle in flour, and continue until a soft dough is formed.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDivide into 48 level 1/2-ounce portions with a 1 tablespoon scoop. Roll until smooth and round, tumble in a dish with raw or granulated sugar, and arrange on prepared sheet pans, leaving 2 inches in between. Do not flatten, these cookies will spread on their own.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake until puffed and chestnut brown, about 22 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pan 2 hours\u2014prior to that, gingersnaps will not be crisp inside. Store leftovers in an airtight container up to 3 weeks at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n, paddle attachment, #60 cookie scoop (1 tablespoon), aluminum half sheet pans\nNotes\nDue to its unique pH and sodium content, blackstrap molasses will give these cookies a cakey texture and slightly bitter edge. If you can't get a hold of molasses, reach for Lyle's Golden Syrup instead.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nPortion dough onto a cutting board wrapped with plastic, cover lightly, and chill until firm; about 30 minutes. Divide between a few heavy-duty zipper-lock bags, and refrigerate for up to one week (freeze for two months). Bring to room temperature, roughly 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), then roll, coat in sugar, and bake as directed.\nCookies\nAmerican\nBaking\nGinger\nChristmas Cookies"
