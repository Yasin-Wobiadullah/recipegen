Sprinkle with sumac. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Nader Mehravari\nNotes\nMake Sure to purchase dried spearmint, and not dried peppermint for this recipe.\nAny tomato variety will work in this recipe, as long as it is fresh and ripe. Information on how to dice tomatoes can be found\nhere\n.\nEnglish cucumber may be substituted for Persian cucumber with an equal amount by weight. Information on how to dice cucumbers can be found\nhere\n.\nSeville Oranges (Bitter Oranges)\nare a prized souring agent in Persian cooking. If in season and available, try replacing half of the acidic ingredient in this recipe with Seville orange juice.\nFor a salad with a bit of a fiery kick, consider adding two cloves of minced garlic or one finely chopped small fresh Thai green chile.\nThis salad is most often served as a side dish, but is also great served as a light main dish along with some bread.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dressed salad can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days before serving. The tomatoes will soften in texture, but the onion and cucumbers will retain most of their crunch.\nAlternatively, the vegetables can be cut and refrigerated in separate airtight containers for up to 3 days then tossed with the prepared dressing right before serving.\nTomato\nThe Latest\nMiddle Eastern\nNo-Cook Salads"
