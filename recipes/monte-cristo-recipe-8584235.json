In a small bowl, whisk milk and egg until combined. Whisk milk mixture into the flour mixture until a smooth batter is formed. Batter should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; set aside until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nFor the Sandwiches:\nPlace 4 slices of bread on a clean work surface. Spread 2 slices with mayonnaise and 2 slices with mustard. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nLayer 1/4 cup (about 1 ounce) of the cheese on each mayonnaise-coated bread slice, top with the ham, divided evenly between the 2 slices. Top with the remaining cheese (1/4 cup per sandwich). Close each sandwich with the remaining bread slices, mustard side down. Press firmly to adhere.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nWorking with 1 sandwich at a time, use a fish spatula and hands to dip and turn the sandwich in the prepared batter to coat evenly. Transfer the sandwich to a large plate and repeat with remaining sandwich.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nIn a large nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat, swirling to coat the pan evenly, until foaming. Carefully transfer the sandwiches to the skillet and cook until golden brown on bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Using 2 spatulas, carefully flip the sandwiches. Set a cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven directly on the sandwiches to press them. Continue to cook until the bottom side is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nTransfer sandwiches to a clean wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and let cool for 5 minutes. Cut sandwiches in half and dust with powdered sugar, if using. Serve with raspberry jam on the side, if using.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven, fish spatula\nNotes\nFor less mess and for ease of handling, cut sandwich into halves or quarters before dredging.\nUsing two large fish spatulas to flip the sandwich (over/under) carefully in the hot oil is the most seamless way to do it.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce the sandwiches are dredged, they should be prepared immediately. Batter and sandwiches, however, can be prepared ahead of time separately.\nHam\nThe Latest\nSandwiches"
