Grill or char the jalape\u00f1os until blackened on all sides and quite soft, about 5 minutes total. Place them in a small bowl covered with a plate or towel and allow the skins to steam and loosen. Peel, stem, and seed the chilis.\nIn a small food processor or blender, combine the jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, parsley, garlic, lime juice, red wine, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pulse (or blend) until the mixture is a coarse puree. Taste and adjust for salt and blend again.\nIf a grill is not already prepared, heat a grill pan over high heat. Rub the steaks with olive oil and season very generously with salt and pepper. Grill until medium rare, 2 to 4 minutes per side depending on thickness (center of steaks should register 125\u00b0F on an instant read thermometer). Remove to a plate and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes.\nSlice the steak across the grain with the knife at a 45 degree angle. Arrange on a serving plate and spoon some chimichurri over the steak. Serve with the extra sauce.\nGrilled Steaks\nJalapenos\nQuick Dinners",
