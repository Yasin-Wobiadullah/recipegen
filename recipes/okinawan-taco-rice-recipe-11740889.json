Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring constantly to avoid browning, until tender and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add ground beef and cook, using a wooden spoon to break up meat into small pieces, until the beef starts to brown, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nAdd chile powder, salt, ground cumin, black pepper, smoked paprika, dried oregano, ketchup, and 1 cup (240 ml) water. Cook, using a wooden spoon to scrape and stir bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until liquid slightly thickens, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, season to taste, and cover to keep warm; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nFor the Cheese Sauce:\nIn a medium saucepan, toss grated cheddar with cornstarch to evenly coat. Add 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) evaporated milk, salt, black pepper, and smoked paprika. Cook on low heat, whisking constantly, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nDivide cooked rice equally among 4 plates. Top each with taco meat, followed by the cheese sauce, lettuce, and sliced tomato. Garnish with salsa and crushed tortilla chips.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nNote\nFor the cheese, if you want to keep it classic, you can skip making the cheese sauce and use 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar instead. To serve, add 1/4 cup of cheddar on top of each serving of beef. The residual heat of the meat will slightly melt the cheese. To get the best melty texture, use freshly grated cheddar, preferably on the thicker grated side. Pregrated, store-bought cheddar has extra ingredients that prevent it from as easily melting compared to the freshly grated stuff.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nWhite Rice\nJapanese\nRice & Grain Mains"
