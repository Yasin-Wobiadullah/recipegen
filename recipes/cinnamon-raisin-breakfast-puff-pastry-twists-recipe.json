Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together sugar and cinnamon.\nLay puff pastry out on a clean surface so that the long side of the rectangle is closest to you. Brush surface with melted butter.\nSprinkle cinnamon sugar evenly across puff pastry, then cover with raisins.\nFold puff pastry in half horizontally. Cut into about 12 1-inch, vertical strips.\nLightly press down sides of first strip to keep filling inside. Carefully twist strip into a spiral. I found it was easiest to do this while keeping the twist as close to my work surface as possible. Continue to twist remaining strips.\nCarefully transfer twists to prepared baking sheet. Bake twists until golden, about 30 minutes.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nWake and Bake: Cinnamon Raisin Twists\nDesserts\nPastries"
