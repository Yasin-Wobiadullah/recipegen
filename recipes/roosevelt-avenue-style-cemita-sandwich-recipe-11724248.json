Mound cheese strands on top.\nSmear top buns with mayonnaise and close sandwiches. Set on baking sheet and transfer to oven until just warmed through and cheese is just starting to soften throughout, about 3 minutes. Or wrap in foil to warm bun and soften cheese, just like they do at the taco truck.

Queso Oaxaca should be shredded by hand into very thin strands, just like string cheese. Cilantro can be used in place of the papalo.\nRead More\nPueblan-style Cemitas\nCharred Corn Tacos in Crispy All Cheese Taco Shells\nThe Best Things I Ate In Mexico City and Puebla\nSandwiches\nRecipes\nMexican"
