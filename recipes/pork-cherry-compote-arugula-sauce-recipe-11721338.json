In a large oven-safe skillet, add cherries, sugar, and salt; stir until evenly coated. Transfer skillet to oven, and bake until cherries are tender and liquid begins to caramelize, 30 to 35 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nRemove skillet from oven, and carefully stir in wine, vinegar, thyme sprig, and bay leaf. Return to oven, and continue to bake until liquid is bubbling and begins to thicken and flavors meld, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool (sauce will thicken as it cools).\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nFor the Pork Tenderloin\n: While the cherries cook, in a small bowl stir together cumin, brown sugar, salt, smoked paprika, and garlic powder until combined. Rub pork with oil and sprinkle evenly with spice mixture, rubbing spices into pork so they adhere. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Let sit at room temperature while the cherry compote cooks.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nOnce cherry compote is cooked, set aside and reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u2103). Roast tenderloin until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 120 to 130\u00b0F (49 to 54\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 130 to 140\u00b0F (54 to 60\u00b0C) for medium, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and let rest 10 minutes while preparing the arugula sauce.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nFor the Arugula Sauce:\nIn a blender, add oil, arugula, basil, pistachios, lemon juice, garlic, ice cubes, salt, and black pepper and blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as needed. Transfer to a small bowl, and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nTo Assemble:\nTransfer pork to a cutting board. Slice crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick medallions, and serve with prepared cherry compote and arugula sauce (reserve any remaining sauce for another use).\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge oven safe skillet, rimmed baking sheet and parchment paper, blender\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe cherry sauce can be prepared ahead and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reheat in a saucepan over medium heat until warmed through.\nThe pork can be refrigerated for up to 4 days and reheated in a 350\u00b0F (175\u2103) oven until warmed through.\nThe arugula sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Note that it may darken in color as it sits.\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nRoasted Pork\nCherry\nArugula"
