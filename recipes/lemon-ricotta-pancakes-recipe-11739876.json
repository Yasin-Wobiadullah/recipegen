Using fine-mesh sieve, sift in flour, baking powder, and salt to ricotta mixture. Whisk until just combined.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk egg whites on medium speed until they begin to foam, about 1 minute. With mixer running at medium speed, slowly add remaining 2 tablespoons (30 g) sugar. Continue to whisk until meringue is glossy and reaches medium-stiff peaks, about 5 minutes. Using a flexible spatula, gently fold meringue into pancake batter. (Alternatively, egg whites can be whisked in a large bowl using a traditional whisk or an electric hand mixer.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nPlace a wire rack inside a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet; set aside.\nHeat a large electric nonstick griddle to medium heat (350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C) or large nonstick, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet or stovetop griddle over medium heat. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter, and, using a 1/3 cup scoop or measuring cup, scoop batter onto griddle or skillet to form 3-inch pancakes spaced 1/2 to 1 inch apart, working in batches if necessary. Cook until bubbles begin to appear on top of batter and bottoms are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip pancakes and cook until bottoms are lightly golden and pancakes are cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm with fresh fruit, compote, and/or maple syrup.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nWhisk, stand mixer or hand mixer, wire rack, rimmed baking sheet, nonstick electric griddle or large nonstick, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet or stovetop griddle\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce cooled, pancakes can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat in the microwave or a 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) oven until warmed through.\nPancakes\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nBreakfast & Brunch\nLemon",
