Repeat with remaining mushrooms in as many batches as needed, adding more oil to the pan before each batch.\nIn a large bowl, combine watercress with cooled mushrooms and cheese. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Dress and toss with just enough vinaigrette to lightly coat salad ingredients, adding more vinaigrette as needed. Serve right away. Extra vinaigrette can be kept refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.\nSpecial equipment\nimmersion blender, large cast iron skillet, baking sheet\nNotes\nIf you can't find oyster mushrooms, feel free to substitute others, such as king oyster or cremini (sliced and then seared), or hen-of-the-woods (divided by hand into small clusters).\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Greatest Watercress Salads Are All About Balance\nGluten-free Salads\nVegetarian Salads\nStovetop\nWatercress\nOyster Mushroom"
