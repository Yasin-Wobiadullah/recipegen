Alternatively, make several trays of large ice cubes. In addition, you'll want about 4 standard trays of ice cubes for serving.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine halved figs, cinnamon sticks, and 4 1/2 cups (1.06L) water and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Let simmer 1 minute. Add tea bags, remove pan from heat, and let steep 5 minutes. Discard teabags, then allow cinnamon-fig tea to stand for 45 minutes. Fine strain into a sealable container, pressing on solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to chill, and up to 24 hours.\nSerious Eats / Emily Dryden\nTo Make Punch:\nIn a large bowl, 3-quart pitcher, or other large container, stir together rum, Madeira, and cooled fig tea. Taste, adding optional maple syrup in 1/4-ounce additions until desired sweetness level is reached (you may not need any, depending on the sweetness of your rum and Madeira). The punch can be served right away or refrigerated, well sealed, up to 6 days.\nWhen ready to serve, transfer punch to a punch bowl and stir well. Add the prepared large ice block or several trays of large ice cubes, plus all but 12 of the lemon wheels. Serve punch in ice-filled cups, garnishing each with a reserved lemon wheel.\nNotes\nYou may want to adjust the drink's sweetness by stirring in a little easily-dissolved maple syrup, but taste the mixture first; the rum and Madeira you use may be sweet enough to get the drink in balance without any added sugar.\nSpecial Equipment\nPunch bowl and ladle, fine-mesh strainer\nRead More\nSweater Weather Punch (Scotch and Cranberry Cocktail)\nFlaming Holiday Punch\nCharleston Light Dragoon's Punch\nRum\nFig\nWinter Drinks"
