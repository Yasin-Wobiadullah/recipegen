Add water to cover completely (About 2 quarts). Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to low, and add cinnamon, black pepper, salt, and ginger. Simmer until tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove from heat and allow brisket and tripe to cool in broth.\nMeanwhile, make the chile sauce. Combine Sichuan peppercorns, sesame paste, soy sauce, and chile oil. Set aside.\nWhen the brisket and tripe have cooled down, remove from the broth and cut on a bias into 1/8-inch slices. Add 1/4 cup beef broth to chile-sesame mixture and stir to combine. Dress the brisket and tripe liberally in the sauce, tossing to coat all the slices. Add the chopped cilantro and serve at room temperature. Leftovers may be kept in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.\nNotes\nYou can use store-bought chile oil, or make your own by toasting a cup of whole dried Chinese peppers in a wok until lightly charred, then adding 1 1/2 cups of vegetable or canola oil. Heat the oil until the chiles start to bubble slightly, then allow to cool and transfer to a sealable container. Chile oil will stay good in the refrigerator for several months.\nBeef Liver & Organ Meats\nChinese-American\nBrisket\nBeef Mains",
