Add salt, and stir until dissolved completely.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCombine vital wheat gluten and bread flour in the bowl of a food processor fitted with metal blade, or in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Process until thoroughly mixed, about 30 seconds in a food processor or 1 minute on low speed in a stand mixer.\nIncrease speed to medium-low and, with machine running, add 1/3 of liquid at a time, allowing time between each addition for liquid to be fully absorbed, about 30 seconds. After final addition, allow machine to run until flour and water mixture looks pebbly, about 1 minute. If using food processor, stop machine and let rest for 30 minutes. If using stand mixer, stop machine, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let rest for 30 minutes. (This pause is to allow the flour to more fully absorb the liquid.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPress dough into a ball and divide into two roughly equal portions. Place both in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.\nWorking with one portion at a time, flatten balls to a thickness of about 1/5 inch (the dough will be very stiff, so do the best you can, as it will make it easier to run through the pasta rollers). Run flattened disk through widest setting of pasta roller, followed by the second widest setting, followed by the third widest setting, followed by the fourth widest setting. Fold dough sheet in half, so it is half of its original length, then repeat entire process two times (it will become significantly harder to run the doubled up dough through the rollers in each iteration). If done correctly, longitudinal lines will form on the sheet of dough. Wrap dough sheet in plastic wrap or place, folded, in zip top bag, and repeat process with the remaining portion. Let dough sheet rests for at least 30 minutes before proceeding.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWorking with one dough sheet at a time, run dough through progressively narrower settings on your pasta machine, until it reaches the thickness you desire (~1-1.5 mm). Run final dough sheet through the spaghetti cutting attachment; dust noodles with flour or corn starch to prevent sticking, shake off excess starch or flour, and fold into loose nests. Alternatively, dust dough sheet with flour, fold it, dust again with flour, and fold again, to form a stack of dough. Using a sharp knife, cut through dough at regular intervals to produce noodles. Once finished cutting, shake noodles to loosen, and fold into loose nests.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPlace noodles in zip-top bag and refrigerate overnight. (Noodles can be used immediately, but they improve significantly in texture and flavor if allowed to age slightly.)\nBefore Cooking Noodles (optional):\nGather noodles into a ball and compress with your palms on a clean, dry surface, using a similar amount of pressure you would use to compress a snowball. Loosen noodles and repeat process, gathering them into a ball and compressing with your palms. (This brief compression gives the noodles their signature curls.)\nTo Cook Noodles\n: Bring large pot of unsalted water to rolling boil over high heat. If using noodle baskets, add noodles to baskets and plunge in water, rapidly stirring noodles with tongs or chopsticks in basket to prevent sticking. If not using noodle baskets, add noodles to boiling water and stir vigorously with tongs or chopsticks to prevent sticking. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes if using hand-cut noodles; cook for about 1 minute and 30 seconds if using noodles cut on spaghetti cutter. (The exact cooking time will depend on your preferences and on the thickness of the noodles.) Drain thoroughly, shaking off as much excess water as possible, and add to hot ramen broth.\nSpecial Equipment\nDigital scale\n,\nmanual pasta machine\nor\npasta roller attachment for a stand mixer\n,\nstand mixer\nor\nfood processor\n,\nrolling pin\n(optional),\nbench scraper\n(optional), noodle basket (optional)\nNotes\nKing Arthur bread flour has one of the highest protein percentages of the many bread flours on the market, and for that reason is specified here.\nIn order to determine the exact amount of time the noodles need to boil, you will have to test them. Cut a single noodle into 5 or 6 pieces, place them in boiling water, and remove them at 10 second intervals, starting at 1 minute and 30 seconds. Repeat the process as many times as necessary to confirm the correct boiling time, according to your preferences. When you have determined the exact time, subtract 10 seconds, to account for the noodles sitting in the hot bowl of broth.\nVital wheat gluten\nis a protein supplement that is used to give breads and noodles more \"chew.\" It is available at most supermarkets, health food stores, and chains like Whole Foods.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nNoodles are best made 24 hours in advance. They can be made up to 3 days in advance and kept in the refrigerator. Noodles that have rested in the refrigerator overnight can be frozen and kept for up to 3 months.\nRead More\nHow to Make Low-Hydration Noodles at Home\nPressure Cooker Chintan Shoyu Ramen Recipe\nMiso Tori Paitan Ramen (Creamy Chicken Broth Ramen) Recipe\n21 Ramen Recipes to Build a Perfect Bowl at Home\nGuide to Ramen Varieties\nDairy-free\nJapanese\nVegetarian\nNoodle Mains"
