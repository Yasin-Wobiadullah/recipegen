(Using hot water will cause the sago pearls to expand too quickly.) Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nIn a medium saucepan, cover sliced bananas, palm sugar, salt, and pandan leaves with the 3 cups (720ml) water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the bananas begin to soften, about 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nUsing a fine-mesh strainer, strain soaked sago pearls and add them to the saucepan. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, gently stir, breaking up any lumps of sugar or sago as needed, until the sago is mostly translucent, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nAdd the coconut milk and cook, stirring, until bubbles begin to appear around the edges, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow pengat to sit until it has cooled slightly, about 5 minutes. Ladle into small bowls and serve.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nSpecial Equipment\nMedium saucepan, fine-mesh strainer, wooden spoon or rubber spatula\nNotes\nLook for sago pearls online or at Asian grocery stores; if you can\u2019t find them, small pearl tapioca offers a similar chew and can be substituted.\nLook for slightly green bananas that are just beginning to yellow. If using ripe bananas instead of green bananas, reduce sugar to 1/4 cup (50g) to accommodate the increased sweetness of the bananas. Season to taste with additional sugar as needed.\nFresh and frozen pandan leaves can be found in well-stocked Asian grocery stores that specialize in Southeast Asian ingredients.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nLeftovers can be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to 3 days if using canned coconut milk or 1 day if using fresh coconut milk.\nTo reheat leftovers in the microwave or on the stove, stir in about 1/2 cup (120ml) water to loosen pengat before heating\u2014or simply eat it cold for a different but equally delightful experience.\nThe Latest\nDairy-free\nDesserts\nBanana\nVegan",
