Add the diced onion, and season with salt and pepper. After 2 minutes, add the minced garlic. Saut\u00e9 another 5 minutes until the onion is translucent and soft, but not golden.\nMeanwhile, feed the celeriac and potatoes through the grating attachment of a food processor. Transfer the grated vegetables to a kitchen towel, and ring out as much moisture as possible. Transfer the dry grated potato and celeriac to a bowl, and season with salt, pepper, and parsley, and add the onion and garlic mixture. Mix thoroughly to combine, and distribute the flavorings. Add the egg, and mix again just to combine.\nAdd 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the same pan in which you saut\u00e9ed the onions and garlic. Press half the potato celeriac mixture into the bottom of the pan, spreading it out all over the bottom. Cook on medium heat for 15 minutes. Then, press a plate over the top of the pancake, and flip the pan so that the pancake then sits on the plate, then slide the pancake raw-side-down into the saut\u00e9 pan and cook another 15 minutes. Repeat with the other half of the potato-celeriac mixture to make the second pancake.\nTo make the apple cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, peel a gala apple, and grate with a box grater on all four sides until you hit the core of the fruit. Discard the core, dress the grated apple immediately with the juice of 1\u20444 lemon, and chop the apple even finer. Combine with the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and season with salt, pepper, and the freshly snipped chives.\nCut the large potato-celeriac pancakes into wedges, and serve with the apple cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche alongside.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Best Potatoes for Latkes\nHanukkah\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop Vegetables\nCelery Root\nVegetable Sides",
