Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nFor the Filling:\nMeanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, combine pork belly, shrimp, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and fish sauce, and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nTo Cook:\nIn an 8-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon cooking oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add several strands of sliced onion, about 5 pieces of pork belly, and about 5 pieces of shrimp, then fry, stirring occasionally, until opaque, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nStir batter to mix well, then ladle about 1/3 cup (50ml) batter into pan in a swirling motion. (You should hear distinct sizzling that tells you you\u2019re at the right temperature.) Immediately swirl batter around pan to form a thin, even layer that spreads up the side of the pan; make sure the batter mostly gets under the solid ingredients to prevent holes from forming around them.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nCook, undisturbed, until edges begin to pull away from side of pan, 3 to 4 minutes. Add a small handful of bean sprouts to one half of the b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nContinue to cook until b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o is crispy and golden brown with small charred bits, 5 to 6 minutes longer. Gently slide a wide silicone spatula underneath and fold in half over the beansprouts, then transfer to a wire rack. Repeat steps 3 to 6 with remaining ingredients, stirring batter each time before ladling. B\u00e1nh x\u00e8o are best eaten right away as each is ready, but you can also hold them on a wire rack in a 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C) oven until ready to serve all together.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nTo Serving:\nServe b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o right away with a platter of vegetables and herbs and/or rice paper (the lettuce and rice paper can be used to wrap around the b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o and herbs), and n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m for dipping.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nNotes\nYou can use two nonstick pans at a time to speed the cooking process.\nYou can use an 8- or 10-inch nonstick skillet, adjusting the amount of batter and filling ingredients as appropriate.\nThis recipe scales up well, if larger batches are desired.\nIf using rice paper to make rolls, set a shallow dish of warm water on the table when serving; diners can dip a rice paper round in the water to soften, then form a roll.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe batter and fillings can be prepared up to 1 day in advance.\nRefrigerate any leftover b\u00e1nh x\u00e8o in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Reheat in an unoiled nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until hot and crispy on both sides, about 5 minutes, or bake in a 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) oven until hot and crispy, about 10 minutes.\nVietnamese\nThe Latest\nShrimp\nSoutheast Asian\nPork"
