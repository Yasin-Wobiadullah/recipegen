Pour enough vinegar on top to just cover. Let stand, stirring once or twice, for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour (the onion will grow softer and more pickled-tasting as it sits). Drain, then add to sandwiches, salads, and other dishes where raw onion would be used.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nDairy-free\nVegan\nVegetarian\nPickling\nOnions",
