Let stand.\nIn a 3-quart saucier or saucepan, cook bacon over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and starting to crisp, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a plate, leaving rendered bacon fat in the saucier.\nAdd diced mushroom caps and cook, stirring, until they release their water and then brown all over, about 6 minutes; add oil as needed at any point if saucepan becomes too dry. Season with salt and pepper. Scrape saut\u00e9ed mushrooms onto plate with bacon and set aside.\nAdd small diced carrot and pearl onions to the saucier, and cook, stirring, until just softened, about 5 minutes; add oil at any point if the pan becomes too dry. Transfer carrots and pearl onions to plate with bacon and mushrooms.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd reserved mushroom stems, large diced carrots, shallots, 1 clove garlic, and thyme sprig to saucier and cook, stirring, until just starting to brown; lower heat and/or add oil to saucier at any point to prevent scorching. Add red wine and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of the pan. Continue to simmer until wine is reduced by half.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, mix butter with flour until thoroughly incorporated; keep cool.\nAdd chicken stock and gelatin to saucier and return to a simmer. Continue cooking until reduced by one third. Strain sauce into a heatproof bowl, discard solids, then return to the saucier. Whisk in butter-flour mixture, then simmer until sauce begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. If sauce is thin, you can reduce further, or whisk in additional butter-flour mixture. Season with salt and pepper. If it tastes too sharp or acidic, you can whisk in a pinch of sugar to round out the flavor.\nAdd bacon and vegetable garnishes to the sauce and heat through. Rub toasts with remaining clove of garlic, then set on serving plates. Slide 2 poached eggs onto each toast. Spoon the sauce and garnishes all over, sprinkle with parsley, and serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucier, whisk, slotted spoon, fine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nIf you can't find frozen pearl onions, you can substitute with an equal quantity of diced onion or shallot.\nChicken stock with sufficient gelatin will turn to jelly when refrigerated; if your stock is store-bought, or if it's homemade but remains liquid even when fully chilled, it needs the unflavored gelatin to be added to it.\nRead More\nEasy Poached Eggs Recipe\nPoached Eggs\nFrench\nStovetop Eggs"
