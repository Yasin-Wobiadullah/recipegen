If you plan on making shelf stable pickles, prepare a boiling water bath canner. Put fresh canning jar lids into a small saucepan with 3 inches of water and set to the barest simmer.\nWash and dry cucumbers. Remove blossom end. Cut into chips, spears or leave whole, depending on your preference.\nEqually divide garlic cloves, dill seed, black peppercorns, and red chile flakes between jars. Pack prepared cucumbers into jars as tightly as you can without crushing them.\nCombine vinegar, water, and salt in saucepan and bring to a boil.\nPour the brine into the jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace (that's the amount of space between the surface of the brine and the rim of the jar).\nRemove any air bubbles from jars by gently tapping them. You can also use a wooden chopstick or plastic utensil to help remove stubborn bubbles.\nWipe rims and apply lids and bands (don't screw them on too tightly).\nIf processing jars for shelf stability:\nlower jars into your processing pot. When water returns to a boil, set a timer for 10 minutes.\nWhen time is up, remove jars from canning pot and allow them to cool. When jars are cool enough to handle, check seals. Let pickles rest for at least 1 week before eating.\nIf you choose not to process your jars:\nlet them cool before putting them into the refrigerator. Do note that your jars may seal during the cooling process. However, without the boiling water bath process, that doesn't mean they're shelf stable. Still refrigerate.\nSpecial Equipment\n4 pint jars or 2 quart jars with lids and rings;\nequipment for boiling-water bath canning\n;\nsaucepan\nRead More\nMilwaukee Dill Refrigerator Pickles Recipe\nLacto-Fermented Dill Pickles Recipe\nQuick Dill Pickle Chips Recipe for Burgers & Sandwiches\nPickle Science: How to Master the Preserving Power of Acids\nPickling\nCucumbers\nGarlic\nSummer Snacks & Appetizers",
