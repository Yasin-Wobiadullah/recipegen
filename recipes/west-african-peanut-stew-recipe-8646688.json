Drain and transfer to a large heat-proof bowl and add 1 teaspoon kosher salt, then cover with boiling water by about 2 inches. Cover loosely and let soak at room temperature until all the peanuts sink, have absorbed some water, and the liquid is cooler, at least 1 hour or up to 12 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nAdjust the oven rack to middle position and heat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u2103). Lay a clean kitchen towel over a rimmed baking sheet. Drain peanuts under running water, rinse well and transfer the peanuts to the kitchen towel-lined baking sheet and pat to dry.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nRemove the towel and roast the peanuts on the rimmed baking sheet, stirring the peanuts 2 or 3 times during roasting, until lightly golden brown and fragrant, about 25 minutes. The nuts will have started to brown and you'll hear an occasional pop and crackle. Remove from oven and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. (There will be more popping and crackling as they cool and shrink a touch.)\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nOnce cooled for 10 minutes, remove the peanut skins by using a clean kitchen towel to rub the peanuts vigorously until the skins come off in bits. Transfer to a colander set over a large bowl or tray and shake until most of the skins are removed.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nDiscard the skins and transfer the peanuts to a blender jar and add 1 cup broth. Blend on high speed until creamy, about 1 minute (some grit may remain). You will have about 2 cups of the pureed peanuts; transfer to a large bowl and set aside. Wash the blender.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn the now-clean blender, make the stew mix by blending the roughly chopped red onion, bell pepper; tomatoes, half of Scotch bonnet or habanero, if using, and 1 cup broth. Blend on high speed until finely pur\u00e9ed, about 30 seconds; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a large bowl, combine 1 tablespoon salt, ginger, garlic, thyme, pepper, and 1 tablespoon oil. Add the chicken and beef and rub well to season the meat; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the sauced meat, and cook, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 10 to 15 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer meat and any bits of ginger and garlic to a bowl.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nAdd the remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil to the pot and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion cut into 1/2 inch pieces, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring until onion softens, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 2 cups broth, stirring with a wooden spoon to remove any bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the remaining Scotch bonnet or habanero half, if using, and bring to a boil, uncovered. Stir in the pur\u00e9ed stew mix, and bring to a boil before reducing heat as needed to maintain a simmer and cook, partly covered, for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nCarefully remove 1 cup of the stew broth and whisk into the reserved peanut paste until well combined. Return the mixture to the pot, stir well, and bring to a boil before returning the meat to the pot, add 3 cups of broth, and season with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Stir well, and return to a boil before reducing heat to low and simmer, partially covered, adjusting heat as needed to maintain simmer and stirring often, until meat is tender, 60 to 90 minutes. Taste and add dried pepper to taste, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nAdd carrots, stir, and continue to cook until the carrots are just softened, about 8 minutes. Add bok choy and the sliced onion. Cover and cook until the bok choy leaves soften and begin to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the lid, stir and cook until the stew is thick and creamy and onion is just softened, about 5 minutes. Let sit off heat to cool and thicken slightly, about 10 minutes. Adjust the stew\u2019s consistency with additional broth to desired texture, if needed, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the pepper half and serve soup with plain rice,\nNigerian plantains\n, or your preferred flatbread\u2014I love Indian rotis and naans.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSpecial Equipment\nColander or sieve, Large pot or Dutch oven, Blender\nNotes\nYou can use 1 cup of already roasted peanuts or 1 cup of unsweetened peanut butter and start recipe at step 5.\nIn place of the Nigerian red dry pepper, you can use cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes.\nYou can use other proteins, such as fried tofu, in place of the chicken and beef, and add additional vegetables such as sweet potatoes, roasted mushrooms, plantains, and/or greens; adjust cooking times as necessary.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can make the peanut blend (step 5) and stew base (Step 9) ahead and refrigerate them in separate, airtight containers for up to 5 days. The finished soup can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave.\nRead More\nHow to Stock a Nigerian Pantry\nGhanaian Chicken and Peanut Stew (Groundnut Soup) Recipe\nPanang Neua (Thai Panang Beef Curry) Recipe\nKare-Kare (Filipino Curry) Recipe\nComfort Food\nThe Latest\nBeef Chuck\nPeanuts\nBraised & Stewed Mains"
