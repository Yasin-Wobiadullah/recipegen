Drain well, then toss with the neutral oil so the noodles don\u2019t stick to each other. Spread noodles out in a thin layer on a tray and refrigerate until fully chilled, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nWhile the noodles are chilling, stir the sesame paste with the warm water until smooth. Stir in soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, sugar, and seasoning oil until thoroughly combined.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nToss the chilled noodles with about 6 tablespoons (90ml) of the vinaigrette until thoroughly coated. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds, cucumbers,\u00a0 scallions, and chili garlic sauce (if using), and serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nChinese sesame paste, unlike most commercially available tahini, is always made with toasted sesame seeds.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe vinaigrette can be made up to 1 week in advance; keep refrigerated in an airtight container.\nThe noodles, once tossed in the sauce, will hold up to 1 day in the refrigerator, but any longer and the noodles will lose their textural quality.\nChinese\nThe Latest"
