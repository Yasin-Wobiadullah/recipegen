The prepared fruit (you should have approximately 10 ounces or 285g) can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 24 hours (see note). If desired, reserve pits to make\nCherry Pit Whipped Cream\n; the cream and cherry pits will need to infuse at least 4 hours prior to whipping, a final step that can be accomplished while the baked tart is cooling.\nFor the Tart Shell:\nPrepare the pie dough as directed in the recipe. After dividing dough in half (or after the final fold, if making a half batch), roll dough into a 12-inch round. Trim away ragged edges with a knife, then transfer to a 9- or 10-inch stainless steel tart ring or tart pan placed on a half-sheet pan (see note). Nestle dough into the bottom edge of the pan, making sure it's also flush with the sides. Fold outer edge of dough toward bottom edge of pan to make a double-thick wall around the sides, pressing and molding with your fingertips to seal the dough together. After shaping, cover dough loosely in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours. When you are ready to proceed with assembling and baking the tart, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\nFor the Frangipane:\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine butter, pistachio paste, and salt. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl and beater as needed, until mixture is creamy, soft, and pale, about 5 minutes. With mixer still running, add egg and continue beating until smooth, then drizzle in cream and continue beating until incorporated.\nFor the Egg Wash (optional):\nIn a small bowl, combine egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt, beating well with a fork until quite homogeneous and smooth. Using a pastry brush, brush mixture around the outer edge of the tart dough. In an airtight container, this egg wash can be held for up to 1 week in the fridge for use in other pastry projects.\nTo Assemble:\nScrape pistachio frangipane into prepared tart shell using a flexible spatula and smooth into an even layer. Immediately arrange cherry halves on top, fitting the pieces as close together as you can.\nBake tart until fragrant, well puffed, and lightly browned on top but still slightly soft and spongy to the touch, about 30 minutes. Loosen the crust from the outer ring with a butter knife and remove the ring while tart is still warm. Let tart cool about 15 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board using an offset spatula. If the tart will not be served warm, transfer to a wire rack instead.\nTo serve, cut with a sharp chef's knife; if desired, top each slice with a dollop of cherry pit whipped cream or pistachio whipped cream. This tart is also excellent with ice cream of any sort. Leftovers can be kept for about 2 days at cool room temperature, if wrapped in foil or stored in an airtight container. If desired, reheat leftovers for a few minutes in a 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) oven before serving.\nSpecial equipment\nRolling pin, 9.5-inch stainless steel tart ring or similar, flexible spatula, pastry brush,\noffset spatula\n,\nhalf-sheet pan\nNotes\nDo not wait until the frangipane is made to pit and halve the cherries, as letting the tart sit out while the cherries are prepared can have adverse effects on the tart, and refrigeration can have adverse effects on the frangipane.\nThis recipe can also be prepared in a 4.5- by 14-inch rectangular tart pan, without any adjustment to the ingredients or bake time, although the dough will need to be rolled into a roughly 6- by 16-inch rectangle instead.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nAfter it's shaped, the dough can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated up to 24 hours. Wrapped in foil, leftover slices of tart will keep for about 2 days at cool room temperature.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFor This Gorgeous Pistachio Cherry Tart, It Pays to Frangi-plan Ahead\nHomemade Pistachio Paste Opens Up a World of Pistachio Desserts\nPies\nPastries\nGluten-free Desserts\nCherry\nPistachios",
