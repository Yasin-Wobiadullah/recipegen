Add asparagus and cook until bright green but still crisp, about 45 seconds. Use a fine-mesh strainer to transfer to a bowl of cold water. Cook fava beans, then peas, then sugar snap peas in succession until each is bright green but still crisp, transferring each batch of vegetables to cold water as they cook. Remove skins from fava beans and discard. Carefully drain all vegetables and transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined tray to dry.\nHeat 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil in a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add morels and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until browned on multiple surfaces, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a large bowl. Add another tablespoon vegetable oil to wok and heat over high heat until lightly smoking. Add green vegetables and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until vegetables are blackened in spots and tender, about 90 seconds. Transfer to bowl with mushrooms.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nHeat final tablespoon oil in wok over high heat until shimmering. Add dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns and cook until aromatic, about 10 seconds. Add olives, scallions, garlic, and ginger and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return mushrooms and vegetables to wok along with Shaoxing wine and soy sauce. Add cilantro and mint. Toss to combine and cook for 30 seconds. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to serving platter and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / J.
