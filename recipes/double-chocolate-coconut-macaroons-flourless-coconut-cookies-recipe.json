Cool slightly.\nIn a large bowl, whisk sugar with cocoa until combined. Whisk in whites, salt, vanilla, and coconut extract. Whisk in chocolate mixture until smooth. Fold in coconut and remaining 2 ounces chocolate (see notes). Chill until firm enough to scoop, about 30 minutes.\nAdjust oven rack to upper-middle position and lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or preferably a non-stick baking liner. If using parchment, lightly grease.\nUsing scoop or tablespoon, portion batter by 2 tablespoons each, spacing evenly onto pans (about 8 cookies per pan). Gently form into mounds.\nBake until set and center doesn't look raw, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cookies cool on pan 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.\nNotes\nIf batter feels warm when it's time to fold in the chopped chocolate, let it cool in the fridge slightly before adding, so that the chopped chocolate does not melt.\nRead More\nThe Best Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons\nRaspberry Dark Chocolate Macaroons\nCookies\nBaking\nChocolate\nCoconut"
