Add herbs. Cover and cook at a gentle simmer until artichokes and other vegetables are tender enough to easily slide a fork through them, about 25 minutes (cooking time will vary depending on the age and size of artichokes; if liquid level ever gets too low, add a little more water).\nDiscard herb bundle. Using a slotted spoon, transfer artichokes, onions, carrots, and garlic, to a serving plate and keep warm. Return cooking liquid to the heat and simmer until slightly syrupy and reduced to about 3/4 cup (175ml).\nWhisk in butter and minced parsley, season with salt and pepper, then pour sauce over warmed platter of vegetables.
