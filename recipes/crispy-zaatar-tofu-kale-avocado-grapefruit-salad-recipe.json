Pour 1 quart boiling water over tofu and let rest for 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined tray and press dry. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add tofu and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp on all surfaces, about 15 minutes total. Sprinkle with half of za'atar and toss to coat. Transfer tofu to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to drain. Scrape remaining contents of pan into a medium bowl and set aside to cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nAdd 2 tablespoons reserved grapefruit juice, tahini, miso paste, lemon juice, and honey or agave nectar to bowl with reserved oil from cooking. Add 1 more tablespoon olive oil. Whisk until smooth, adding more grapefruit juice or water as necessary to achieve a smooth, pourable consistency about the texture of heavy paint. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nAdd tofu to a large bowl. Add remaining tablespoon olive oil and remaining za'atar, season with salt, and gently fold together.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nAdd greens and half of dressing and gently fold to combine. Add grapefruit segments and avocado and gently toss to combine. Serve immediately, drizzling remaining dressing on top.\nSerious Eats / Victor Protasio\nNotes\nFeel free to mix up the base of the salad if you're bored of salad greens. Roasted vegetables, like beets or cauliflower, work great, as does kale or heartier winter lettuces.\nDairy-free Salads\nVegan Salads\nVegetarian Salads\nStovetop\nGrapefruit"
