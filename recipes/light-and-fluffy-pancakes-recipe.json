Transfer to an airtight container. The mix will stay good for 3 months. (See note.)\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nFor each Batch of Pancakes:\nPlace one batch of dry mix in a large bowl. In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogenous. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking. Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps).\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nHeat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Use a 1\u20444-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nNotes\nPancake dry mix can be scaled up as many times as you'd like. Each batch of pancakes takes 11 ounces of dry mix to make (about 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons). The sour cream can be replaced with more buttermilk.\nRead More\nOatmeal and Brown Butter Pancakes\nFluffy Vegan Oatmeal Pancakes Recipe (With Aquafaba)\nEasy Homemade Pancake Mix\nPancakes\nFather's Day\nButtermilk\nMother's Day\nWinter Breakfast & Brunch"
