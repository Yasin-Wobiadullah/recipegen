In a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook elbow macaroni until just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than cooking time indicated on package. Drain, then transfer pasta to a large mixing bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons (30g) butter until butter is melted and pasta is evenly coated. Set aside.\nIn a large saucepan, bring 3 cups (720ml) water to a simmer. Whisk in sodium citrate until fully dissolved. While maintaining a gentle simmer, add cheddar cheese in small increments, whisking constantly to incorporate each addition before adding the next. When all the cheese is added and the sauce is smooth and glossy, whisk in hot sauce, mustard powder, and garlic powder. Season with salt, if necessary.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nScrape cheese sauce into pasta and mix until evenly coated. Let cool slightly, then add grated Gruy\u00e8re and mix well. Scrape pasta into a greased 9- by 13-inch baking dish and smooth surface into an even layer.\nAdd panko to a small mixing bowl. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter, then add to panko and mix until evenly coated. Season with salt. Scatter panko all over surface of mac and cheese in an even layer. Bake on top rack of oven until browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes (ovens can vary; check often to prevent top from burning).\nLet mac and cheese rest 15 minutes, then serve. Leftover mac and cheese can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; it reheats surprisingly well in the microwave or oven.\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 13- inch baking dish\nNotes\nFood-grade sodium citrate is available online. Buy it once, then have a supply for making awesome cheese sauce and cheese dip for years\u2014you won't regret having it in your pantry.\nFor the cheese, any semi-firm cheese, such as cheddar, Swiss, Gruy\u00e8re, Fontina, or Jack, can work here; feel free to use whichever appeals to you.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nCasserole can be assembled through the end of step 3, then covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to five days before baking. Increase baking time by 15 minutes if refrigerated.\nRead More\nClassic Baked Macaroni and Cheese Casserole With Cheddar and Gruy\u00e8re\nAmerican\nSoul Food & Southern\nVegetarian Sides\nBaked Pasta\nCheddar Cheese"
