This can be done up to a week in advance; crust can be held at room temperature if wrapped tightly in plastic.\nFor the Filling:\nIn a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt and mix until smooth, then whisk in eggs, lime zest, and lime juice, followed by milk. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly but gently, until hot to the touch, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIncrease heat to medium and continue whisking until thick, about 3 minutes longer. When custard begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for exactly 2 minutes. (This is important to neutralize a starch-dissolving protein found in egg yolks.) Remove from heat and stir in rosewater, if using. Pour into prepared pie crust. For a silkier texture, first strain through a stainless steel sieve, pushing the thick custard through with a flexible spatula.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Topping:\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Prepare Swiss meringue as directed, making a half or full batch depending on your own personal preference for meringue. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Starting at the very edge of the pie, pipe meringue kisses over surface of custard until completely covered. Alternatively, spread meringue over custard with the back of a spoon. Place on a wire rack set inside a half sheet pan (this setup minimizes heat transfer to the custard) and bake pie until meringue is well browned, about 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Serve:\nCool pie to room temperature, then cover loosely in plastic and refrigerate until no warmer than 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C), about 3 1/2 hours. Cut with a wet chef's knife, rinsing the blade clean with cold water between slices. Wrapped in plastic, leftovers can be refrigerated up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n9-inch pie plate\n,\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n(see note),\nwhisk\n,\nstainless steel fine-mesh strainer\n(optional), pastry bag and tips (optional),\nhalf sheet pan\nand\nwire rack\n,\ndigital thermometer\nNotes\nYou can zest and juice the limes right before making the pie, or do it up to 3 days in advance; combine and refrigerate in a nonreactive, airtight container until ready to use. If you like, save the leftover rinds to make a lime variation of\nfresh lemon syrup\n.\nWhen working with citrus, it's vital to use nonreactive equipment throughout\u2014a stray aluminum whisk, pot, or sieve is all it takes to give the custard a harsh, metallic flavor.\nRead More\nLemon Meringue Pie\nOrange Meringue Pie\nChocolate Orange Cream Pie\nBanana Cream Pie\nPies\nNorth American\nPie Dough\nLime\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings"
