Add the olive oil and caraway seeds and continue kneading until they are fully incorporated. Cover the dough and let it rest until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nWhen the dough has doubled, flour your work surface and turn out the dough. Knead it briefly, then divide it into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball and place them on a single baking sheet that will fit into your smoker (a quarter-sheet pan fits in mine) for pull-apart rolls, or on two baking sheets for individual rolls.\nCover the rolls with plastic wrap and set aside until nearly doubled in size, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare your smoker and soak your wood chips according to the manufacturer's directions. Set the temperature for 275\u00b0F.\nWhen the dough has just about doubled, uncover it and bake it in your smoker until the dough is lightly golden and cooked through, about 45 minutes. Remove the buns from the smoker, and remove them from the pan to cool on a rack.\nSides\nYeast Breads\nSmoking\nRye"
