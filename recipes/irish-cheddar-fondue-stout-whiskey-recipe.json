Add the garlic cloves and cook until fragrant and just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Pour in the stout and whiskey, and stir in the salt and mustard powder. When the sauce begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium low.\nAdd 1 handful of the cheese and cornstarch mixture to the pot and whisk until the cheese is completely melted. Continue adding handfuls of the cheese mixture to the pot, stirring until each addition is melted before adding the next addition of cheese; this will take 2 to 3 minutes. When all of the cheese has been melted, continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer the fondue to a bowl and serve immediately with cubed bread, sliced apples, or leftover corned beef as dippers.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge saucepan or saucier\nSnacks & Appetizers\nCheddar Cheese"
