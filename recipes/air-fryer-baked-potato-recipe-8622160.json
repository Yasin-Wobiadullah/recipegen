  "full_text": "Air-Fryer Baked Potato\nJump to recipe\nCook\n40 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nServes\n2\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nTwo\n8-ounce (227g)\nrusset potatoes\n, unpeeled\nCanola\n,\nvegetable\n, or\nolive oil\n, for rubbing\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n4\ntablespoons\n(57\ng\n)\nbutter\n, softened\nToppings of your choice, such as grated\ncheddar cheese\n, crispy diced\nbacon\nbits, minced\nchives\n, sliced\nscallions\n, and/or\nsour cream\nDirections\nUsing a fork or paring knife, lightly prick each potato all over several times. Rub each potato with oil. Sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nPlace potatoes in air fryer basket, spaced evenly apart. Place basket in air fryer and cook at 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C) until the potato skin is crispy and a paring knife inserted into the center of the potatoes meets little to no resistance, about 45 minutes. (Center of potatoes should register between 205 to 210\u00b0F [96 to 99\u00b0C] with an instant-read thermometer.)\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nTransfer potatoes to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice each open lengthwise and scoop flesh into a mixing bowl. Add butter, season with salt and pepper, and roughly mash, just until butter is incorporated but potatoes are still chunky.\nSerious Eats / Jen Causey\nScoop mashed potatoes back into skins. (You can refill each skin, making 2 potatoes, or use all the mashed potato to refill only one skin, making 1 overstuffed potato.) Using your hands, reshape each stuffed potato back into a classic baked potato shape.\nAdd toppings of your choice. To melt cheese, add it first, then return potatoes to the air fryer set at\u00a0 400\u00b0F oven until cheese melts, about 30 seconds to 1 minute; alternatively, use a torch to melt cheese. Serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nAir fryer\nRusset Potatoes\nThe Latest\nVegetable Sides\nPotatoes\nAir Fryer Recipes"
