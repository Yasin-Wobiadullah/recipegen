In a separate medium bowl, toss apples with brown sugar to evenly coat; let stand, stirring occasionally, until apples have released some liquid and broken down slightly, 20 to 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nFor the Apple Topping:\nWhile the apples macerate, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice and cook, stirring frequently, until apples are tender and can be pierced easily with a knife, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in maple syrup; set aside, covered, in a warm place.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nFor the Maple Whipped Cream:\nIn a large bowl, combine heavy cream and maple syrup. Using an electric hand mixer, whip on medium speed until medium peaks form, about 2 minutes.\u00a0 Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. (Whipped cream can also be prepared in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.)\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nWhisk egg, milk, sour cream, melted butter, and vanilla into macerated apple mixture until well combined. Add apple mixture to flour mixture; using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir just until combined. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nHeat a large nonstick griddle to medium heat (350\u00b0F/175\u00baC) or large nonstick skillet over medium. Using a 1/3 cup scoop, scoop batter onto griddle or skillet to form pancakes. Spread into 4-inch discs spaced 1/2- to 1-inch apart. Cook until bubbles start to appear on top of batter and bottoms are golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to prevent overbrowning. Carefully flip pancakes and cook until bottoms are lightly golden and pancakes are cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining batter.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nServe pancakes immediately; garnish with apple topping, chopped toasted pecans, maple syrup, and maple whipped cream.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\nElectric hand mixer, griddle, wire rack, rimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nIf you\u2019d prefer to mix your own pumpkin pie spice, sift 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon,\u00a0 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice, and 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves into a small bowl. Whisk until well combined. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months. Yields about 2 teaspoons spice mix.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe pancakes are best enjoyed fresh.\nThe apple topping is best eaten the day it\u2019s made. Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Gently reheat in the microwave until warmed through before using.\nThe maple whipped cream is best enjoyed fresh. Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Whisk to bring back together if needed; whisk in additional heavy cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, to adjust consistency if needed.\nApple\nThe Latest\nBreakfast & Brunch\nFall\nFall Breakfast & Brunch"
