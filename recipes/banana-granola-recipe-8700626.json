Alternatively, this can be done in a food processor or with an immersion blender. Add rolled oats, wheat germ, flaxseed, and chia, tossing with a flexible spatula to combine. Cover with plastic and set aside until oats are stiff and dry, about 30 minutes. Stir in sugar; cover and let stand until well dissolved, about 30 minutes more. Finally, stir in melted coconut oil.\nFor the Mix-Ins:\nWhile oats are soaking, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Combine pumpkin seeds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, and pecans on parchment-lined half-sheet pan; toast until fragrant and just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer to large bowl, toss with a teaspoon of oil and sprinkle with salt. Stir in dried mangos, dried cherries, and dried blueberries.\nTo Bake the Granola:\nReduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C). After stirring in melted coconut oil, scrape granola onto parchment-lined half-sheet pan used for toasting the nuts. Spread mixture into even layer. Bake until uniformly golden brown and dry to the touch, about 110 minutes, pausing every 25 minutes or so to remove mixture from oven to stir well with a pair of forks. Be sure to circulate granola from edges of the pan to center and vice versa, so that it bakes and dries evenly.\nWhen oats are deep golden brown and dry to the touch, although perhaps a little soft, transfer them to the bowl of fruit and nuts. Toss with flexible spatula until well combined; return to baking sheet and spread in even layer to cool, about 45 minutes. As soon as granola has cooled, add freeze-dried bananas (if using) and transfer to airtight container. The granola will keep up to 6 weeks at cool room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nFlexible spatula,\nHalf-sheet pan\nNotes\nSmall packages of dried fruit can be wildly expensive; look to stores that sell in bulk or else shop online. These are my favorite brands of dried mango slices, tart cherries, and blueberries. When making substitutions, think about the flavors, textures, and colors you're replacing, and choose fruit with a similar profile. For example, dried apricots and dried mango have a similar color, chewiness, and tart flavor.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe granola will keep up to 6 weeks at cool room temperature.\nBanana\nGranola",
