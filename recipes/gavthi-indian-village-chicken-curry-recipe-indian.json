Season chicken all over with salt, then rub all over with marinade. Set aside.\nFor the Spice Paste\n: Heat a cast iron skillet until smoking, then turn the heat down. Toast sesame seeds, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, Kashmiri chiles, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, and cloves until they release their aroma, about 15 seconds, stirring constantly so they don't burn. Set aside to cool.\nOnce toasted spices have cooled, using an immersion blender or countertop blender, blend spices with coconut and 3 tablespoons (45ml) water until a smooth paste has formed. Set aside.\nFor the Curry\n: In a heavy-bottomed, lidded saucepan, heat oil until shimmering, then turn the heat down. Add green chiles and bay leaves. Stir until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add onion and keep stirring until soft but not brown, about 5 minutes.\nAdd spice paste and keep stirring until fragrant and until oil floats on top, about 10 minutes. Add marinated chicken pieces and stir until coated in the spice mix, about 5 minutes. Add remaining water to thin out the mixture for more gravy.\nSeason with salt, stir once, and cover pot. Turn heat to medium. Cook for about 15 minutes or until chicken is tender.
