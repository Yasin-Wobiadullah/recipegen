  "full_text": "Honey Biscuits\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n14 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nTotal\n34 mins\nServes\n8 biscuits\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\ncups\nall-purpose flour\n1\ntablespoon\nbaking powder\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n1\ncup\nmilk\n1/4\ncup\nhoney\n1 1/2\nsticks\n(\n3/4\ncup\n)\ncold\u00a0unsalted butter\nDirections\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a small bowl, combine the milk and honey. Stir until it is completely combined.\nCut the butter into chunks and add it to flour. With a pastry cutter or two knives, cut the butter into the flour until it's the size of small peas. Add the milk and honey mixture to the flour and mix gently just until there are no dry spots.\nFlour your work surface and turn the dough out. Pat it into a rough rectangle, then roll it until it's about 1/2 inch thick. Fold it in thirds, like a letter, and roll it again. Fold in thirds again. This time, roll it again to about an inch thick. With a 3-inch biscuit cutter, cut as many biscuits as you can. Re-roll the scraps and cut more biscuits. You can re-roll a third time, but I usually use the final scraps for a free-form biscuit.\nPlace the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet, If you like soft sides, place the biscuits so they touch. If you want the sides more crisp, keep them separated. If you like, brush the top of the biscuits with milk, butter, or cream. Bake at 400 degrees until the tops are nicely browned, 12-14 minutes.\nSoul Food & Southern"
