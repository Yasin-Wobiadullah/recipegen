Adjust heat to maintain a strong simmer. Stir in onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is half tender, about 5 minutes. Add chicken pieces and cook, stirring and turning chicken occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and broth has reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes for chicken thighs or 3 to 4 minutes for chicken breast. Stir in half of scallions and all of mitsuba (if using), then season broth to taste with more soy sauce or sugar as desired. The sauce should have a balanced sweet-and-salty flavor.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nReduce heat to a bare simmer. Pour beaten eggs into skillet in a thin, steady stream, holding chopsticks over edge of bowl to help distribute eggs evenly (see video above). Cover and cook until eggs are cooked to desired doneness, about 1 minute for runny eggs or 3 minutes for medium-firm.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nTo Serve:\nTransfer hot rice to a single large bowl or 2 individual serving bowls. Top with egg and chicken mixture, pouring out any excess broth from saucepan over rice. Add an extra egg yolk to center of each bowl, if desired (see note). Garnish with remaining sliced scallions and togarashi. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch skillet\n,\nchopsticks\nNotes\nHomemade dashi is nice, but not necessary for this simple dish, which has so many other strong flavors.\nMitsuba is a Japanese herb similar to parsley. It can be found in Japanese grocery stores; omit it if unavailable.\nFor a richer finished dish, use 4 eggs, reserving 2 of the yolks. Beat the extra egg whites together with the eggs in step 2, then add the reserved egg yolks to the finished bowls just before serving.\nTogarashi is Japanese chile powder, which comes in both ichimi (chiles only) and shichimi (chiles blended with other dried aromatics) versions. Either will work on this dish.\nRead More\nKatsudon (Japanese Chicken or Pork Cutlet and Egg Rice Bowl) Recipe\nChicken Donburi (Japanese Rice Bowl) With Spinach Recipe\nGyudon (Japanese Simmered Beef and Rice Bowls) Recipe\nEggplant Rice Bowl (Donburi) Recipe\nJapanese\nDairy-free Mains\nChicken Thighs\nEggs\nWhite Rice"
