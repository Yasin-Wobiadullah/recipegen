Drain and rinse salt cod with cold water, then transfer to cutting board.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nUsing 2 forks or your hands, flake salt cod into pieces, making sure to remove any lingering bones (the exact size of the pieces is flexible, from very fine to bigger chunks, depending on preference). Return to large bowl.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nStir in onion, tomato, scallions, Scotch bonnet, thyme leaves, salt, and a generous grinding of black pepper. Fold in flour.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nStir in 2/3 cup (160ml) water, until a thick and chunky batter is reached. (Add more water if needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, to achieve proper consistency.)\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nIn a large cast iron skillet or stainless steel saut\u00e9 pan, heat oil (oil should measure 1/2-inch deep in skillet) over medium heat until oil registers 375F (190\u00b0C). Working in batches to avoid crowding the oil, carefully drop heaping 1-tablespoon-size dollops of batter into oil; make sure to release them close to the surface to avoid splashing. Fry fritters until edges turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip fritters and fry until second side is golden, about 2 minutes longer (adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature between 350 and 375\u00b0F (177 to 190\u00b0C). Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer fritters to paper towel-lined sheet tray to drain. Return oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and repeat with remaining batter; top up oil as needed.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nServe hot with dipping sauce of choice.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe salt cod can be soaked and flaked, then frozen in a sealed bag with the air pressed out for up to 2 weeks. When ready to use, transfer to refrigerator to defrost for about 24 hours.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet or stainless-steel saut\u00e9 pan, spider or slotted spoon\nCod\nThe Latest\nFried Seafood\nJamaican"
