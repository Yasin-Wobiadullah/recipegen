Place cooking grate on grill and set wok in center. Add oil and heat until smoking. Add beef and cook, stirring and tossing until beef is lightly charred but still pink in spots, about 1 minute. Push beef to sides of wok to clear space in center. Add peppers and onions and cook, stirring vegetables in center until lightly charred, about 30 seconds. Toss with beef and push up sides of wok. Add garlic/ginger/scallion mixture to center of wok and immediately push all ingredients into center, tossing and stirring until beef is cooked through and vegetables are just barely tender, about 30 seconds longer. Stir sauce and pour into wok (it should immediately start to boil). Toss all ingredients to coat in sauce and cook until lightly thickened, about 30 seconds. Carefully transfer to a serving platter and serve.\nTo Cook On A Burner\n: When ready to cook, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of beef and cook without moving until well seared, about 1 minute. Continue cooking while stirring and tossing until lightly cooked but still pink in spots, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with 1 more tablespoon of oil and remaining beef, adding beef to same bowl. Wipe out wok. Repeat with 1 more tablespoon oil and half of peppers and onions. Transfer to bowl with beef. Repeat with remaining oil and remaining peppers/onions. Return wok to high heat until smoking. Return peppers/onions/beef to wok and add garlic/ginger/scallion mixture. Cook, tossing and stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sauce and cook, tossing and stirring constantly until lightly thickened, about 45 seconds longer. Carefully transfer to a serving platter and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\n,\ncharcoal grill\nwith wok insert (optional)\nRead More\nChinese-American Beef and Broccoli With Oyster Sauce\nStir-Fried Beef With Chinese Broccoli\nSpicy Stir-Fried Beef With Leeks and Onions\nSichuan Dry-Fried Beef Recipe\nThe Best Outdoor Wok Burners for Restaurant-Style Stir-Fries\nBeef Stir-Fry\nChinese-American\nStovetop Beef\nFlank Steaks\nSkirt Steaks",
