Thin out with coconut water to desired consistency, between 2 and 2 1/2 cups. Whisk in lime juice and salt to taste, then chill in refrigerator.\nFor fruit pearls:\nIn a blender, combine fruit juice with sodium alginate and blend until very smooth. Strain into a wide bowl and let sit for several minutes for large air bubbles to disperse. In the meantime combine water and calcium chloride in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.\nUsing a syringe or the edge of a spoon, add fruit juice drop by drop into water bath. Drop juice in from a low height to keep pearls relatively round and uniform. Let pearls sit in water bath for one minute, then taste one. If skin is too thin and bursts too easily (likely in your hands), let sit for one or two more minutes.\nWhen all pearls are set, transfer to strainer and rinse under cold water to remove bitter taste of water bath. Place pearls in bottom of soup bowls and top with chilled coconut broth.\nSpecial equipment\nblender, scale accurate to 0.1 gram\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHave You Tried Modernist Cuisine at Home?\nDesserts\nCoconut"
