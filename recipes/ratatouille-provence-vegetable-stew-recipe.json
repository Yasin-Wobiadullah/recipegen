Toss both with a liberal amount of kosher salt and let stand to drain at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. Discard any liquid that collects in the bowls.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and garlic, season with salt, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 6 minutes. Scrape onion and garlic onto a rimmed baking sheet and spread in an even layer to cool for 3 minutes. Transfer onion and garlic to a large pot.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, add 3 more tablespoons olive oil to skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add bell pepper, season with salt, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 7 minutes. Scrape bell pepper onto the rimmed baking sheet in an even layer to cool for 3 minutes. Transfer bell pepper to pot with onion.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd 3 more tablespoons olive oil to skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add summer squash and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Scrape onto rimmed baking sheet in an even layer to cool for 3 minutes. Transfer to pot with onion and bell pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil to skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add eggplant and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes; add more olive oil as needed if skillet dries out while cooking eggplant. Scrape eggplant into pot with other vegetables and stir to combine.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSet pot of vegetables over medium-high heat and stir in tomato pur\u00e9e\u00a0and herb bundle; heat until ratatouille is gently bubbling, then lower heat to medium and cook, stirring, until tomato pur\u00e9e coats vegetables in a thick sauce, about 15 minutes. Discard herb bundle. Season with salt, stir in chopped parsley (if using), and drizzle with a small amount of fresh extra-virgin olive oil. Serve right away, or chill and serve either reheated, slightly chilled, or at room temperature.\nPur\u00e9ed tomatoes more fully pervade and flavor the dish.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n2\nwire mesh strainers\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nCanned whole tomatoes often provide some of the best quality you can get, but feel free to use a pur\u00e9e\u00a0made from cooked fresh ones if they're good enough. You can also peel, seed, and dice fresh tomatoes and use them in place of the pur\u00e9e; they will hold their shape more in the finished ratatouille, and their flavor will be more subdued.\nHerbs are optional and can include all sorts beyond the ones suggested below; oregano, marjoram, and savory are also good options.\nYou can speed up steps 2 through 5 by cooking the vegetables individually in multiple skillets at once, then transferring them to a pot to finish cooking together.\nRead More\nProven\u00e7al Tian (Eggplant, Zucchini, Squash, and Tomato Casserole)\nGrilled Ratatouille\nSummer Ratatouille with Pasta\nVegetable Sides\nFrench\nEggplant\nZucchini & Yellow Squash",
