Set tofu on paper towels, lay more paper towels on top and press to extract any excess moisture. Set aside.\nIn a Dutch oven or large saucepan, combine almond milk and oregano. Add cauliflower, cover, and bring almond milk to a boil over high heat. Continue to cook, covered, until cauliflower is fully tender, about 10 minutes; adjust heat as necessary to maintain boil while preventing scorching.\nAdd coconut oil, basil, and garlic. Using an immersion blender, pur\u00e9e cauliflower until very smooth. Add tofu and pur\u00e9e into cauliflower until well incorporated; the resulting pur\u00e9e should have a slightly grainy, ricotta-like texture thanks to the tofu. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nFor the B\u00e9chamel:\nIn a small saucepan, combine almond milk with bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns, and garlic. Bring to a bare simmer, then lower heat to maintain a bare simmer for 20 minutes. Strain almond milk into a heatproof measuring cup and discard aromatics.\nIn a small saucepan, heat coconut oil over medium heat until melted. Add flour and cook, whisking, until raw flour smell is gone, about 2 minutes.\nWhisking constantly, add infused almond milk in a thin, steady stream, or in increments of a couple of tablespoons at a time, whisking thoroughly and getting into all corners of the pan to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added.\nHeat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until b\u00e9chamel sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes. Stir in nutmeg and season with salt and pepper.\nFor the Lasagna:\nAdjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Drain pasta well. In a 9- by 13-inch baking dish, lay down a single layer of lasagna sheets to cover the bottom of the dish. Spread an even layer of vegan \"ricotta\" top, then spread a layer of tomato sauce (or vegan rag\u00f9, if using) on top of that. Drizzle with some of the b\u00e9chamel. Repeat in alternating layers of pasta, \"ricotta,\" tomato sauce (or rag\u00f9), and b\u00e9chamel sauce until baking dish is full and/or any of the components is used up. The final layer should be tomato sauce (or rag\u00f9) with b\u00e9chamel drizzled on top. You may have some of the vegan \"ricotta\" left over, which can be reserved for another use (such as spreading on toasts).\nSet baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until lasagna is browned on top and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Let lasagna rest 20 minutes before serving. Cut individual portions and serve while still warm.\nSpecial Equipment\n9- by 13-inch baking dish\n, rimmed baking sheet,\nfine-mesh strainer\n,\nimmersion blender\nNotes\nMake sure to use refined neutral coconut oil, not a virgin oil that still smells and tastes of coconut.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Vegan Italian-American Lasagna Without Ricotta or Mozz\nVegan\nPastas\nVegetarian\nDairy-free Mains",
