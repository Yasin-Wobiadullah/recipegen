Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, and add the egg. Mix until just combined. It will look a bit curdled.\nAdd the flour, and run the machine just until the dough comes together (you can\u2019t see any dry flour), and not a second more. Turn the dough out onto a big sheet of plastic wrap, and knead two to three times, so the dough has no air pockets or cracks. Roll the dough, using the plastic wrap, into a 10-inch log. Refrigerate for 2 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Cut the ragged ends off the log of dough, and then slice into 1/4-inch rounds. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and bake until the edges of the sabl\u00e9s are just golden, 15-17 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes outside to cool, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve with lots of ros\u00e9!\nSpecial equipment\nstand mixer\nCookies\nFrench"
