Season on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat 1/3 cup oil in a large stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add salmon fillets skin side down. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, pressing gently on back of fillets to ensure good contact with skin, until skin is rendered and crisp, about 6 minutes. If skin shows resistance when attempting to lift with a spatula, allow it to continue to cook until it lifts easily.\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, combine arugula, lemon juice, remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, and avocado. Season with salt and pepper and toss in grated cheese.\nFlip salmon and cook on second side until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium, about 1 minute longer.
