Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar and salt dissolve. Remove from the heat and let cool 5 minutes. Pack sliced radishes into a 2-cup heatproof Mason or other glass canning jar. Pour brine into jar, making sure to cover the radishes completely. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Seal jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake or rotate it to evenly distribute the brine and spices. The pickles will be ready in about 1 hour, but are best after a few hours. They can be refrigerated up to 1 week.\nFor the Bourbon Barbecue Sauce:\nIn a small saucepan, stir together ketchup, chicken stock, sugar, vinegar, 1/4 cup bourbon (60ml), onion, Dijon, molasses, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by about one-third (sauce should be glaze-like). Stir in the remaining tablespoon of bourbon and add more vinegar or hot sauce to taste, if desired. Cooled barbecue sauce can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.\nFor the Nachos:\nHeat oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet, Dutch oven, or wok over medium-high heat until it registers 375\u00b0F. Adjust flame to maintain temperature. Working in batches, add tortillas and fry, agitating with a metal spider, until edges just start to brown. Flip chips over and continue to cook until crisp and light golden brown. Transfer chips to a paper towel-lined tray, sprinkle with salt to taste, and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes to drain. Repeat with remaining batches. Set aside until ready to use.\nIn a medium bowl, combine chicken with 3/4 cup (180ml) of Bourbon Barbecue Sauce. Toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper and add more sauce if needed.\nAdjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.\nLayer 1/2 of chips in the bottom of a rimmed 9-by-13-inch baking sheet or baking dish. Drizzle with half of the cheese sauce and scatter half the shredded barbecue chicken on top. Top with half the corn kernels and sprinkle with half the grated cheese.\nLayer the remaining chips on top. Drizzle with remaining cheese sauce, chicken, and corn. Top with jalape\u00f1os and sprinkle all over with remaining grated cheese. Bake until grated cheese is completely melted, about 5 minutes.\nTop with tomatoes, onion, and avocado and drizzle all over with sour cream or crema. Garnish with cilantro leaves and drained pickled radish slices. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\n2-cup Mason or other canning jar; wok, Dutch oven, or 12-inch cast iron skillet; metal spider; rimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nFrying your own tortilla chips yields the best results, since they're guaranteed to be thick and crisp enough to stand up to the toppings; if you have a good source of store-bought tortilla chips, feel free to skip the frying step and use them here. For the chicken, you can buy a rotisserie chicken and pull the meat off, or\nroast\nor\ngrill\nyour own.\nCorn\nThe Latest\nNachos"
