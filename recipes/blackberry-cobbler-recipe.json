In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, tapioca starch, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda until well combined. Add berries and toss to coat. Scrape into a 7- by 11-inch glass, ceramic, or stoneware baking dish (do not use metal) and set aside while you prepare the topping.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Topping:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add butter and toss to break up pieces, then smash each one flat between your fingertips. Continue smashing and rubbing until butter is broken up into small pieces like cereal flakes. Stir in buttermilk with a flexible spatula, then drop thick dough in 1-tablespoon portions over the prepared dish of fruit. If you like, sprinkle with additional sugar for crispier tops.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPlace on a foil-lined half-sheet pan and bake until biscuits are golden brown and fruit is bubbling hot in very center, about 1 hour. Cool at least an hour before serving, to allow filling to thicken (while piping hot, it will be runny and thin). Covered in foil, leftovers will keep 2 or 3 days at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFlexible spatula, 7- by 11-inch baking dish,\nhalf sheet pan\nNotes\nDue to disparate sourcing practices, tapioca starch manufactured in Asia may be derived from plants other than cassava, which have different gelling properties. Look for products that mention cassava by name on the packaging, such as Bob's Red Mill.\nIf you don't have raspberries, you can substitute with more blackberries.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nCover and store at room temperature for 2 to 3 days.\nRead More\nPlum-Blackberry Cobbler\nClassic Biscuit-Topped Peach Cobbler\nCan You Tell Your Buckle From Your Boy Bait?
