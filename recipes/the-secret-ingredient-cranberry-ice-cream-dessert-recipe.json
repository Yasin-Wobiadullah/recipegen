Meanwhile, use electric beater to beat together egg yolks and remaining 1/3 cup sugar, until mixture is pale and thick.\nOnce cream mixture is hot, pour 1/3 of it into egg yolk mixture and whisk quickly to temper egg yolks. Pour mixture back into pot with remaining cream, and cook over low heat. Use wooden spoon to constantly stir custard until thick enough to coat back of spoon, about 170\u00b0F. Pass custard through fine mesh sieve into large bowl. Whisk in cranberry mixture. Cover cranberry custard, and chill in the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, at least 4 hours.\nFreeze according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Just before the ice cream is completely churned, add white chocolate chunks. Transfer to lidded container, and freeze for at least 4 hours. Let stand at room temperature 10 minutes before scooping and serving.\nIce Cream\nCranberry\nHeavy Cream"
