Spread chicken wings directly on an unlined rimmed baking sheet. Roast wings until golden brown, about 30 minutes.\nTim Chin\nRemove wings from oven and drain any rendered chicken fat into a heatproof bowl and reserve. Pour about 1/2 cup of water on baking sheet and scrape up any browned bits that may be stuck to the bottom.\nTim Chin\nTransfer wings along with water and dissolved browned bits to a large soup pot or Dutch oven. Cover with 1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) water. Bring to a boil over high heat on the stovetop, let boil vigorously for 15 minutes, then reduce to a simmer and cook gently for 2 hours, adding water as needed to maintain the 1 1/2-quart volume.\nTim Chin\nStrain broth through a fine-mesh strainer set over a heat-proof container, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Return broth to now-empty pot.\nTim Chin\nMeanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine chicken legs with enough water to barely cover, along with 1 tablespoon (9g) salt and 1 teaspoon black peppercorns. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickest part of legs registers 190\u00b0F (88\u00b0C), about 30 minutes. Drain chicken, reserving 3/4 cup (175ml) cooking liquid; discard peppercorns. When cool enough to handle, tear chicken into bite-size pieces. Set aside.\nTim Chin\nWipe now-empty saucepan dry. Add reserved chicken fat and oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is coated in oil and beginning to toast, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in reserved 3/4 cup chicken leg poaching liquid and swirl gently to evenly distribute the rice. Bring rice to simmer, then cover, lower heat to low, and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Off heat, uncover rice and stir to fluff. Set aside until ready to serve.\nTim Chin\nHeat a dry 12-inch cast iron or stainless-steel skillet over high heat. Char onion slices until blackened on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Add onions to broth, return to a boil, then reduce heat and gently simmer for 30 minutes. Strain broth through a fine-mesh strainer set over a clean heat-proof container; discard solids.\nTim Chin\nReturn now-empty pot to medium-high heat. Sprinkle the 1 teaspoon ground pepper into pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until pepper is smoky and fragrant, 45 to 60 seconds.\nTim Chin\nAdd broth, carrots, celery, and remaining 1 tablespoon salt and bring mixture to a simmer. Cover and cook until vegetables are just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt; if broth tastes overly rich or too full-bodied, thin with hot water 1/2 cup at a time until desired flavor is reached. To serve, divide cooked rice between bowls and ladle soup over rice. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.\nTim Chin\nSpecial Equipment\nSoup pot or large\nDutch oven\n, medium\nsaucepan\n, 12-inch\ncast iron\nor\nstainless steel\nskillet.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nTo make ahead, prepare recipe through Step 7; store chicken, broth, and cooked rice separately in refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months. To serve, finish soup as described in Step 8.\nSoups\nRice & Grain Mains\nChicken Mains\nThe Latest\nStovetop Chicken",
