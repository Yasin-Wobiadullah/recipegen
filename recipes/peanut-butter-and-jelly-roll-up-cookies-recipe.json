Add cream cheese and butter and pulse until dough is just starting to come together, but not a coherent ball, about 10 short pulses. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and form dough into a ball, then cut ball into two equal pieces. Form each half into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.\nLine two baking sheets with parchment paper. On a clean and lightly floured surface, roll out one ball of dough to a 12- by 6- inch rectangle. Brush with 1/2 strawberry jam and top with 1/4 cup peanut butter chips. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting at the wide end. Cut into 12 cookies. Place cookies with the cut sides on the side (not facing up and down) on a baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough. Cover baking sheets with plastic wrap and let chill for 30 minutes in refrigerator.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly beat egg with 1 teaspoon water to create egg wash. Brush each cookie with egg wash and sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar. Bake cookies until golden, 20 to 25 minutes. If any jam has seeped out the sides while baking, use a knife to brush aside while cookies are still warm. Let cool for 5 minutes on sheet then transfer to a rack to finish cooling.\nSpecial equipment\nbaking sheets, rolling pin, food processor,\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCookie Monster: Peanut Butter And Jelly Roll-Up Cookies\nCookies\nNorth American\nBaking\nPeanut Butter"
