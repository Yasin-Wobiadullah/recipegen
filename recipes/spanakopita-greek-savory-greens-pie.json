Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Brush a 9-inch glass pie plate (either deep-dish or standard size will work with this recipe) generously with olive oil and set on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet.\nFor the Filling:\nIn a large bowl, combine chopped greens, chopped herbs, 1/4 cup olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Massage together to gently wilt the greens, then set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, scallions, and garlic and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the hot mixture to the greens and combine to further wilt the vegetables. Add the trahanas (or your substitute of choice) and egg and thoroughly combine. Once everything is well mixed, fold in the crumbled feta.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Assemble the Pie:\nUnroll thawed phyllo and keep it covered with a moist kitchen towel while working. Working with 1 sheet at a time, lay phyllo so that it is centered in the pie pan with the excess draping over the rim and brush generously with about 1 tablespoon olive oil. Repeat with 3 more sheets of phyllo, each sheet placed perpendicular to the previous one, brushing with olive oil before adding the next.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd greens mixture to phyllo-lined pie. Fold excess phyllo over greens and drape remaining 2 sheets of phyllo over the top. Drizzle with more olive oil. Slice into portions using a serrated knife. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool at least 15 minutes before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nGlass pie plate,\nrimmed baking sheet\n, pastry brush\nNotes\nFeel free to mix and match whatever quick-cooking greens you have on hand\u2014we recommend a combination of spinach, watercress, Swiss chard, and arugula, but as long as you avoid hearty greens, like kale and collards, any mix can work in this pie. If you prefer to keep things traditional, this recipe works with all fresh spinach as well.\nTrahanas is a type of pasta made from fermented dairy and grain. It is traditionally used in Greek cuisine for thickening soups or to absorb moisture from the greens in spanakopita. An equal amount of rice, barley, or couscous can be used in its place.\nRead More\nCreamy Garlic Chicken Spanakopita Skillet\nSavory Crinkle Pie Recipe\nThree-Cheese Hearty Greens and Puff Pastry Tart\nSpanokopita-Style Hand Pies\nBorek (Armenian Spinach and Cheese Turnovers)\nSpinach, Egg, and Feta Breakfast Pockets\nSavory\nVegetarian\nGreek\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nFeta Cheese",
