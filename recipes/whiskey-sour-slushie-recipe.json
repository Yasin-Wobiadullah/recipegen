Transfer to freezer and chill until very cold, about 1 1/2 hours.\nTransfer chilled base into ice cream maker and churn until base looks like a soft sorbet without visible liquid pooling at the top. A spoon pressed against the base should leave a clear indentation once removed. Transfer churned base to an airtight container and chill in freezer until ready to serve.\nFor the Red Wine Syrup:\nIn a small saucepan, whisk together wine and sugar over high heat. Once all sugar is dissolved, let wine boil until it reduces in volume by half, bubbles begin to stack on each other, and the syrup reads 222\u00b0F on a candy thermometer. Transfer to a small container and chill in refrigerator until ready to serve.\nTo Assemble:\nSpoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of wine syrup in the bottom of each bowl or cup. Scoop about 1/2 cup slushy base into a small work bowl, then stir in additional whiskey to each person's taste. Slushy base will remain semi-solid even with a generous amount of added alcohol. Serve with a spoon or a thick straw.\nYou can also mix each slushy directly in its bowl or glass and then top with the syrup, but the presentation won't look quite as neat.\nSpecial equipment\nIce cream maker\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Boozy Slushies in an Ice Cream Machine\nSerious Entertaining: A Vegetarian Cookout\nFrozen Drinks\nWhiskey"
