Season oxtails all over with salt. In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, cook oxtails until lightly browned all over, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer oxtails to plate, then repeat with remaining oil and oxtails. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nReduce heat to medium. Add onions, green and red bell peppers, and garlic. Season lightly with salt, then cook, stirring frequently to prevent browning, until vegetables have softened and onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nIncrease heat to medium-high, stir in tomato paste, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nReturn oxtails to Dutch oven along with any accumulated juices. Add wine, bay leaves, cloves, saz\u00f3n, oregano, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne, mixing until everything is incorporated. Bring to a boil, cover partially with lid, then transfer to oven and cook until oxtails are tender and starting to fall off the bone, about 3 1/2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nReturn Dutch oven to stovetop, uncover, and cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the sauce reduces and thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nServe immediately with rice and maduros.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe finished braised oxtails can be refrigerated for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.\nOxtail\nThe Latest",
