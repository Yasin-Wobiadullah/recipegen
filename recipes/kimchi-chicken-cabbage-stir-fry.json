Add chicken and cook until almost cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes.\nAdd cabbage and cook until cabbage is just beginning to wilt, about 1 more minute. Season to taste with chili sauce and fish sauce.

This shape ensures minimum cooking time and maximum flavor.\nKimchi is a type of Korean fermented cabbage which can be found in the refrigerated section of most well-stocked supermarkets, and at Asian markets. Gochujang is a shelf-stable Korean chile paste often sold in tubs or in tubes. The amount of chili sauce and optional fish sauce will depend on the strength of your kimchi. Season to taste.\nThe longer the dish sits, the more liquid will collect at the bottom from the weeping cabbage. It's best to serve immediately.\nChicken Stir-Fry\nKorean\nChicken Breast\nCabbage\nChicken Mains",
