(A small drop of water dropped into it should immediately sizzle.) Carefully break eggs into hot oil, dropping them from right above the surface to prevent hot oil from splashing. Season with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nTilt the skillet toward you so oil pools against the side of the pan. Using a spoon, baste eggs with hot oil, aiming at the uncooked portions of the egg whites and avoiding the yolk. Continue basting until eggs are puffy and cooked, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch cast iron skillet\nor\ncarbon steel skillet\nor\nnonstick skillet\nFried Eggs\nBreakfast & Brunch\nEaster\nMother's Day"
