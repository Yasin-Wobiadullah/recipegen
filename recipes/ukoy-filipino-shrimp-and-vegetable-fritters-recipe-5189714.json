In a medium bowl, whisk together water, rice flour, and salt until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, add batter to large bowl with vegetable mixture, and fold together until vegetables are evenly coated.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nHeat oven to 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C). Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). To form ukoy fritters, use your fingers to mound roughly 1/2 cup (85g) of the vegetable mixture in single layer in a large heatproof spoon. Nestle 1 shrimp in the center, top with a second 1/2 cup (85g) of vegetable mixture, and gently press down to form a 3-inch disc. Using another large heatproof spoon or spatula, carefully slide ukoy off spoon into oil (don\u2019t worry if the ukoy separates slightly during frying), then form a second ukoy, and slide into oil. Fry until golden brown on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted metal spatula, carefully flip ukoy over and continue to fry until golden brown on second side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to prepared baking sheet, season lightly with salt, then transfer to oven to keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing a spider skimmer, skim any browned bits of batter from oil, and discard. Return oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and repeat process with remaining vegetable mixture and shrimp.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer ukoy to a plate and serve immediately with dipping sauce.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n, slotted spatula,\nspider skimmer\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n, and\nwire rack\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nWhile Ukoy is best served and enjoyed immediately, the dipping sauce can be prepared in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.\nRead More\n25 Filipino Recipes, Because We Can't Stop at Just One\nFilipino Food 101\nWok Skills 101: Deep-Frying\nFilipino\nSnacks & Appetizers\nShrimp\nFried Seafood\nThe Latest"
