  "full_text": "Scooped: Really Buttery Pecan Ice Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nActive\n45 mins\nChurn and Chill\n12 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n13 hrs 5 mins\nServes\n8\nto 10 servings\nMakes\n1 quart\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n9\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n, divided\n1\ncup\nplus\n1\ntablespoon\npacked dark brown sugar\n, divided\n3\ncups\nhalf-and-half\n(or\n1 1/2\ncups\ncream and milk\n)\n5\ntablespoons\nshiro miso paste\n6\negg yolks\n1\ntablespoon\nvanilla extract\n1/4\nteaspoon\ncinnamon\n1 1/2\ncups\npecans\nPinch\nsalt\nDirections\nIn a large saucepan, melt 8 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat, then stir in brown sugar. Increase heat to medium-high and cook sugar until it just begins to smell toasted and smoky, 2 to 3 minutes. Add half and half and miso paste, whisking to combine. Bring to a bare simmer, whisking frequently.\nWhile dairy mixture is heating, whisk egg yolks well in a medium bowl. When dairy just begins to bubble, add one third of mixture to yolks, one ladleful at a time, whisking constantly. Then transfer yolk mixture to saucepan and whisk to combine. Reduce heat to low.\nCook custard, stirring frequently, until it coats the back of a spoon and a swiped finger leaves a clean line. Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla and cinnamon. Pour through a strainer into an airtight container and chill overnight before churning according to manufacturer's instructions.\nWhile ice cream is churning, toast pecans in a large saucepan over medium-high heat with remaining tablespoon of butter and brown sugar. Stir frequently and cook until pecans smell toasted and darken slightly in color. Add salt to taste and set aside.\nWhen ice cream is finished, transfer to a large airtight container or a bowl. Stir in pecans, then transfer to airtight container to chill for 4 to 5 hours; ice cream will be very soft out of the churn and needs time to set. Stir ice cream well before serving, as pecans may have sunk to the bottom.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nIce Cream\nPecans",
