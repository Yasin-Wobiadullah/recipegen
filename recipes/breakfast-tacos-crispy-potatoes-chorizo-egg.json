Transfer to a plate and keep warm. Wipe out skillet.\nAdd remaining teaspoon oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add eggs, season with salt and pepper, and cook until whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nDivide potato mixture between tortillas.
