Process about 30 seconds to ensure the leavening agents are fully homogenized into flour.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd solid coconut oil and pulse only until it disappears into a dry and powdery mix, just a few seconds. It's important the coconut oil is fully combined into the flour, while also remaining powdery and dry, so use caution and avoid over-processing. (At this point, you can either continue on with the recipe or transfer the mix to an airtight container and store up to one year at or below 74\u00b0F (24\u00b0C), or until the date stamped on the package of coconut oil.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPreheat an electric griddle to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C), or heat a large, nonstick skillet to a similar temperature on the stovetop. In a large mixing bowl, whisk milk, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined. Add flour/coconut oil mixture and whisk until smooth, although a few flecks of coconut oil may dot batter.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWith a large scoop, measuring cup, or ladle, divide thin batter in 1/4-cup portions (or as desired) and griddle until golden brown on either side, and cooked through the middle, about 90 seconds per side. Serve immediately, with butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or whatever other toppings sound fun.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTroubleshooting: The timing and yield of this recipe will vary substantially depending on how the pancake batter is portioned as well as the exact temperature of the griddle itself. When pancakes are excessively browned but raw in the middle, the griddle is likely too hot; when the pancakes are cooked through but too soft and pale, the griddle may be too cool.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n,\nelectric griddle\n, large scoop, measuring cup, or ladle for portioning\nNotes\nThis mix can be prepared with an equal amount of cold, unsalted butter to replace the coconut oil; however, this will eliminate its make-ahead qualities, and the mix will need to be prepared and used right away.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nIn an airtight container, the pancake mix can be stored up to one year at or below 74\u00b0F (24\u00b0C), or until the date stamped on the package of coconut oil.\nRead More\nThick and Fluffy Pancakes From Homemade Pancake Mix\nLight and Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes\nOvernight Brown-Butter Yeast-Raised Waffles\nButtermilk Vanilla Waffles\nPancakes\nAmerican\nStovetop\nQuick Breakfast\nMother's Day"
