Put on disposable latex gloves before handling the dried chiles. Using kitchen shears and, working over the wire rack, cut off the stems from the chiles and cut them into strips. Shake the sheet tray to separate the seeds from the chiles and discard.\nIn a spice grinder working in batches, blend the dried chiles to a fine powder. In a dry saut\u00e9 pan, toast the chile powder, coriander, and caraway over medium heat until fragrant. You can stop here and use the harissa in this dry form as a seasoning blend.\nTo make the harissa paste, add 1 cup (240ml) water to the saut\u00e9 pan and simmer until the paste is thick, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Finish the harissa paste by mixing in the olive oil, vinegar, and salt. The harissa is best the next day and keeps in the refrigerator for a month.\nSpecial Equipment\nSpice grinder\n, Sheet tray,\nwire rack\n, gloves, kitchen shears\nNotes\nMix and match any variety of dried chilies to make the harissa suit your taste. For a spicier condiment, incorporate smaller varieties; stick with larger chilies if you prefer to keep it mild.\nRead More\nHarissa Is the Customizable Condiment of Your Sweet, Spicy Dreams\nFresh Chile Harissa\nWhat to Do with Harissa\nGrilled Corn with Harissa and Mint\nCondiments & Sauces\nGluten-free\nMemorial Day",
