Remove and discard stems and slice caps in half. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nBruise red and black dates by twisting them so that the outer layers of the dates are broken. Gently press on ginger with the back of a knife to bruise it.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nIn a small dry skillet, cook garlic cloves, tossing frequently, until charred in spots. Tie garlic, ginger, and red and black dates in a cheesecloth sachet or in a muslin soup bag.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nIn as many cheesecloth sachets or muslin soup bags as needed, tie up white peppercorns, foxglove root, Solomon\u2019s seal, cassia bark, angelica root, Szechuan lovage, licorice root, codonopsis, tangerine peel, star anise, goji berries, Szechuan peppercorns, fennel seeds and cloves.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nFor the Soup:\nIn a large saucepan, combine 2 quarts (2L) water with frozen pork ribs and soft-boned meat pieces and bring to boil over high heat. Once water begins to boil, remove from heat. Drain pork pieces in a colander, then rinse under cold running water to remove any residue or scum.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nIn an 8-quart Dutch oven or stock pot, combine pork pieces, 4 quarts (4L) water, shiitake caps, and all the sachets and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nAdd Chinese light soy sauce, oyster sauce, Chinese dark soy sauce, and cane rock sugar and continue to simmer until pork is very tender and comes off the bone easily, about 2 hours; check water level periodically and add more as needed to keep ingredients covered.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nWhile soup simmers, cut tofu puffs and canned button mushrooms in half and trim roots off enoki mushrooms. Taste the broth and adjust the flavor to your liking with Chinese light soy sauce (savory) and/or cane rock sugar (sweet). If the soup's flavor is too strong for your liking, add water to dilute to taste.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nIncrease the heat and bring the soup back to a boil. Add halved tofu puffs and button mushrooms to the soup and boil for 2 minutes. Gently arrange enoki mushrooms and iceberg lettuce on the surface of the soup. Then, using the back of a ladle, gently press them into the soup to cook for 30 seconds. Be careful not to mix them with the rest of the ingredients in the pot as it will affect the visual appeal of the dish.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nStir in a small handful of cilantro leaves, then serve with white rice drizzled with Chinese cooking caramel, and a dip of minced raw garlic and chopped bird\u2019s eye chile mixed with Chinese light soy sauce. Garnish with additional cilantro at the table.\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nSpecial Equipment\nCheesecloth and/or muslin soup bags, 8-quart Dutch oven or stock pot\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis soup will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the fridge. The broth will be more flavorful the next day, though the meat will be a little tougher.\nMalaysian\nThe Latest\nSoutheast Asian\nPork\nSoups",
