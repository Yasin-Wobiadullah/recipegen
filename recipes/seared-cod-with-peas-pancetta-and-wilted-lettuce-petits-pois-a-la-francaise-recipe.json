Season the cod with salt and pepper and place presentation-side-down in the hot skillet. Cook without moving until the fish takes on a nice golden crust and lifts easily from the spatula, about 4 minutes. Carefully flip fish with a thin metal spatula and cook on second side until cooked through, about 1 minute longer. Remove skillet from heat and transfer cod to a paper towel-lined plate.\nAdd the pancetta to the same skillet, and return to medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until pancetta starts to become crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the peas and warm through, stirring often. Add 2 tablespoon of water, lettuce, parsley, and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Stir over the heat until the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche has melted and the lettuce is just beginning to wilt. Season with salt and pepper.\nTo plate, make a bed of the peas. Top with the cod. Garnish with more parsley.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFrench in a Flash: Crispy Seared Cod and Petits Pois \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7aise\nCod\nFrench\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop Seafood\nPancetta & Guanciale"
