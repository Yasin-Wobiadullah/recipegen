Whisk in milk and Irish cream liquor until combined. Add flour and baking powder to the bowl, then stir until just about smooth (see note).\nHeat 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet until melted over medium-low heat. Scoop as many 1/4 cup portions of batter into pan as will fit without crowding, then gently spread out into a disc shape. When bubbles appear on the surface, flip the pancakes over and continue to cook until done, about 1-2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter (see notes). Serve warm with butter and syrup.\nSpecial Equipment\nNonstick skillet\nNotes\nCake flour can get easily packed if you measure with a cup. For best results, scale out the flour or gently spoon the flour into the cup. If the first pancake is too thick, gently stir in a tablespoon or two of milk (or Baileys!). Avoid over-mixing the dough or else the batter will become too tough\u2014your final batter will contain some lumps. When cooking the subsequent batches of pancakes, you may only need a slight bit, if any, extra butter for the pan.\nPancakes\nMother's Day\nSt. Patrick's Day",
