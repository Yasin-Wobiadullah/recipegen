Add cr\u00e8me de cacao and bourbon or rye and stir well. Half-fill glass with crushed ice and stir to combine. Fill glass completely with crushed ice and stir until outside of glass frosts. Add more crushed ice, heaping generously, then garnish with sprigs of fresh mint. Serve, adding a short straw if desired so that the fragrance of the mint bouquet will greet the drinker with each sip.\nNotes\nRye tends to be less sweet-tasting than bourbon, which you may prefer if you find the combination of chocolate notes and bourbon a little too sweet. It's a matter of personal taste, but worth experimenting with if desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nMuddler\n, Lewis bag or\nshaved ice maker\n, julep cup or large rocks glass\nRead More\nA Summer of Juleps: 4 Icy Cocktails to Beat the Heat\nHow to Make a Perfect Mint Julep\nSpiked Thin Mint Milkshake Recipe\nCocktails\nRecipes\nChocolate\nDrinks"
