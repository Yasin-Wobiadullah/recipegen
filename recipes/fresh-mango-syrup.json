Toss to combine, then cover tightly and let stand at room temperature, stirring once every 45 minutes or so, until sugar has completely dissolved, about 4 hours. Alternatively, cover bowl and set out overnight (between 8 and 12 hours) for same result.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer to a stainless steel strainer set over a nonreactive bowl, pressing gently on the peels and pits with a flexible spatula in order to extract as much syrup as possible. Refrigerate syrup for up to 2 weeks in a glass bottle or half-pint jar. Serve over ice with club soda as a sparkling beverage, or use in place of lemon syrup in recipes such as\nlemon chantilly\n,\ncandied pistachios\n, and\nlemon poppyseed dressing\n.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFlexible spatula,\nnon-reactive sieve\nSyrup\nMexican\nNo-Cook Fruit\nMango\nCinco de Mayo"
