In a Dutch oven, combine chicken legs with pur\u00e9e, remaining onion halves, remaining 1/2 ounce ginger, and remaining 2 cloves garlic, along with hot pepper and bay leaves. Toss to coat.\nSet Dutch oven over medium heat and bring to a simmer, then cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until halved onion is soft and translucent, about 20 minutes. Add an extra 1/2 cup (120ml) chicken stock if mixture begins to stick to the bottom of the pot.\nTransfer chunks of onion, ginger, garlic cloves, and hot pepper to blender. Add peanut butter, canned tomatoes and their juices, and remaining 1 1/2 cups (360ml) chicken stock and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Pass blended mix through a fine-mesh strainer into the Dutch oven, stirring to incorporate.\nIncrease heat to medium and bring to a simmer, then lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is tender, oils have surfaced, and mixture has thickened and reduced by about one-third, about 40 minutes. Add smoked fish, reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook an additional 5 minutes. (If omitting the smoked fish, you can skip this 5-minute covered-cooking step.) Remove and discard smoked fish and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve hot over white rice or fufu.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n(or\nimmersion blender\n),\nDutch oven\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nFor a milder dish, cut the pepper in half and remove its seeds. Alternatively, use just half a pepper, or choose a less spicy pepper, such as a jalape\u00f1o.\nHot-smoked fish is a traditional ingredient in groundnut soup and adds a savory, fishy, smoked undercurrent of flavor to the dish. It can be found in most West African and Caribbean markets, but can be omitted if you're unable to find it or prefer to leave it out.\nFufu is a starchy dish made from pounded and boiled cassava root and green plantains.\nRead More\nChicken Yassa (Senegalese Braised Chicken With Caramelized Onions)\nNigerian Beef Stew\nKanuchi (Cherokee Pureed Nut Soup)\nVegan Peanut, Sweet Potato, and Kale Soup with Coconut\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Legs\nPeanuts\nChicken Mains\nWinter Mains"
