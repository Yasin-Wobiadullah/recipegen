  "full_text": "Light and Easy 5-Minute Fruit Mousse\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nActive\n5 mins\nTotal\n5 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8 1/2\nounces\n(about\n2 1/4\ncups\n)\nfrozen berries\nor other fruit\n2\ntablespoons\nsugar\n(or use sugar,\nhoney\n,\nmaple syrup\n, or\nstevia extract\nto taste)\n1\nlarge\negg white\nFresh berries\nand whipped cream for serving (optional)\nDirections\nAdd fruit to the bowl of a food processor. Process to a rough puree, about 1 minute. Add the sugar or another sweetener and pulse briefly to combine. If you're using a different sweetener, add a small amount at a time to taste.\nSerious Eats / Nila Jones\nAdd the egg white and process until smooth and fluffy and the mixture has lightened in color and doubled or tripled in volume, 2 to 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Nila Jones\nIf the mixture clings to the sides of the food processor's bowl too much (this may happen if the blade doesn't extend all the way to the sides of the bowl), transfer the mixture to a normal medium-sized bowl and beat with a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until fluffy.\nSerious Eats / Nila Jones\nSpoon the mousse into glasses and top or layer with fresh berries and/or whipped cream (optional). Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours (because this mousse has very little sugar in it, it's not very stable and it won't hold for longer than that).\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nNotes\nThis mousse contains raw egg white. Pasteurized egg whites can be used, though the mousse might not turn out quite as fluffy. Those concerned with the health risk of raw eggs should not make or consume this recipe. I call for a little refined sugar in this recipe, but feel free to use honey, maple syrup, or even stevia extract instead, or leave the sweetener out altogether.\nCustards, Mousses & Puddings\nRaspberry\nMother's Day\nFather's Day\nSummer Desserts"
