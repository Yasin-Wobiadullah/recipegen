If you prefer a little fat left on the breasts after cooking, just barely score the skin; to render more fat, score more deeply, taking care not to expose the flesh.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSeason duck breasts with salt, heavily on the skin side and lightly on the flesh side.\nPlace duck breasts, skin side down, in a large, cold saut\u00e9 pan. Place pan over low to medium-low heat. To keep the edges from curling up, press duck breasts down with the help of a smaller saut\u00e9 pan or cooking weight. After about 5 minutes, the fat should begin to gently bubble. If the fat is either silent or spitting, adjust heat accordingly. Maintain the gentle bubble of fat, pouring out excess rendered fat throughout the cooking process, until much of the fat has rendered, skin is golden brown, and duck's internal temperature is 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C), about 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIncrease heat to medium and further brown skin if needed, about 1 minute, before flipping and cooking on the flesh side. For medium-rare meat, cook until breast registers 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 to 2 minutes. Continue cooking until duck registers 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) for medium or 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0F) for well-done. Remove duck from pan and set aside to rest.\nFor the Pan Sauce:\nOver high heat, deglaze saut\u00e9 pan with white wine. Scrape up any brown bits stuck to pan and let wine reduce until pan is almost dry and only 1 to 2 tablespoons remain, about 2 minutes. Add chicken stock and let reduce by half, until sauce is sticky and rich, about 2 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and swirl in butter until melted and evenly incorporated. Season sauce with orange zest and juice, salt, and black pepper. Serve with duck breast.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nThermometer\n, large\nsaut\u00e9 pan or skillet\n, small\nsaut\u00e9 pan\nor\ncooking weight\nRead More\nJust Add Water: How to Make a Pan Sauce, and How to Fix a Broken One\nSous Vide 101: Duck Breast Recipe\nSeared Duck Breast With Prosciutto, Sage, and Peaches\nDry-Aged Roast Duck Breast\nDuck \u00e0 l'Orange\nDuck Mains\nStovetop\nDuck\nQuick Dinners\nMother's Day"
