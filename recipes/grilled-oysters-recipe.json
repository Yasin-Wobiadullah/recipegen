Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes.\nClean and oil\ngrilling grate.\nPlace oysters directly over hot side of grill. Using 2 spoons, place 2 teaspoons (10ml) of compound butter inside each. Cover and cook until butter is melted and liquid is bubbling, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter lined with seaweed or moistened kosher salt (to keep oysters level; see note) and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / J.

Lining your serving plate with seaweed will allow you to keep the oysters stable. If using kosher salt instead, put a cup of kosher salt in a bowl and moisten with water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it has the consistency of wet sand. Place small mounds of moistened salt on your serving platter and nestle an oyster into each mound to hold them stable.\nRead More\nHow to Shuck an Oyster\nGarlic-Parsley Butter\nParmesan-Basil Butter\nKimchi Butter\nGrilled Seafood\nGrilled Seafood\nSnacks & Appetizers"
