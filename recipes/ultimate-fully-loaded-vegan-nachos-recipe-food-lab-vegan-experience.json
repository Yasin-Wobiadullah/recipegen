Heat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Add 1/3 or tortilla chips and cook, agitating and flipping them constantly with a wire mesh spider until bubbles slow to a trickle and chips are pale golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined bowl, season with salt, and toss. Allow to drain for 30 seconds, then transfer to a second bowl. Repeat with remaining chips in 2 more batches.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nLayer 1/3 of chips in the bottom of a large cast iron skillet or baking dish. Dollop with 1/3 of chili and 1/3 of refried beans.

Drizzle with 1/3 of cheese sauce. Transfer to oven and bake until edges of chips are well browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven.\nTop with half of salsa, tomatoes, olives, jalape\u00f1os, radishes, scallions, onions, cilantro, and a big dollop of guacamole. Serve immediately with remaining salsa and guacamole on the side.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nNotes\nHigh quality store-bought tortilla chips can be used in place of the fresh, but the chips will not stay crisp as long.\nFor better results, cut the recipe for vegetarian bean chili in half, omitting the kidney beans and using the full amount of chopped garbanzo beans for a chili with more uniform texture.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis recipe requires that you complete many other recipes before you begin. All recipes except for the guacamole can be completed several days in advance, leaving only the guacamole, fresh sliced vegetables, and layering for the final day just before serving. If using chilled pre-made toppings, warm them up in the microwave or on the stovetop before applying, or alternatively, build nachos in layers, placing them in the oven for five minutes to warm the toppings in between each layer.\nRead More\nThe Ultimate Fully Loaded Nachos\nReal Texas Nachos\nMicrowave Nachos for One\nChicken Tinga Nachos\nNachos\nVegan\nSouthwestern & Tex Mex\nDairy-free Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers",
