Steep until softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer rehydrated chiles to a granite mortar and pestle and pound until pulverized, 3 to 5 minutes.\nPounding thoroughly between each addition to break down and incorporate each ingredient into the paste, add lemongrass, galangal, makrut lime zest (if using), coriander roots (if using), garlic, shallot, shrimp paste, peanuts, nutmeg, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and white peppercorns until a very fine paste forms, about 25 minutes. Use right away or transfer curry paste to an airtight container, covering paste with plastic wrap pressed directly onto its surface to prevent it from drying out, and refrigerate for up to 1 week.\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle\nNotes\nDried spur chiles are a type of Thai chile known as prik cheefa haeng; they have a fruity, mild flavor, and are prized for the color they impart to curry pastes. They can be hard to come by in the US, but are sometimes available online. Alternatively, you can substitute puya or guajillo chiles, which are available at Central American markets.\nGalangal is a rhizome and an integral part of basic red curry pastes. If you are in the US, it's usually best to peel it before slicing as most of what we get is mature galangal, which is very tough to work with. While galangal looks like ginger, they are not interchangeable, as their flavors are very different.\nFresh makrut limes can be hard to find in the US. You can order them online, though they are a seasonal product and may not always be available (note that they are often sold under a different name that we avoid using, as it is a\nderogatory term in some contexts\n); you may also be able to find them in the freezer section at Southeast Asian markets. Makrut lime zest freezes well. If you cannot find makrut lime, you are better off omitting it, as the more common Persian lime and other citrus are not good substitutes.\nThe roots of fresh coriander (a.k.a. cilantro) provide a slight herbal note to curry pastes, but are unfortunately hard to find in the US, as they are often cut off from the stems before going to market (though local farmers markets in the summer and fall often have coriander with the roots still attached). Coriander roots can also be found at Southeast Asian markets. If you can't find the herb with the roots still attached, you can either use the tender stems, which won't make too much of a difference in this particular curry, or omit it altogether. And, to clarify, although they are called coriander \"roots,\" Thai cooks usually also use some of the tender green stem.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nCurry paste can be refrigerated in an airtight container, with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the paste to prevent it from drying out, for up to 1 week.\nRead More\nPanang Neua (Thai Panang Beef Curry)\nA Guide to Thai Curry Pastes\nA Guide to Thai Curry Varieties\nPrik Gaeng Khiao Waan (Thai Green Curry Paste)\nPrik Gaeng Pak Dtai (Southern Thai Curry Paste)\nPrik Gaeng Massaman (Thai Massaman Curry Paste)\nThai\nSoutheast Asian\nCondiments & Sauces"
