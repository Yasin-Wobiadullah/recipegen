Remove from heat, stir in orange blossom water, and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.\nPrepare the filling:\nCombine nuts in food processor and pulse 3 to 5 times, until just broken up. Add dates and pulse until date chunks are the size of marbles. Do not work into a paste. Pour 2 tablespoons of syrup into a small bowl, then mix syrup and filling together in a large bowl.\nForm the turnovers.\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F, spacing three racks evenly. Lightly flour a work surface and roll puff pastry into roughly a 20\" by 12\" rectangle, trimming edges with a sharp knife. Use knife to create a 5 by 3 grid of 4-inch squares.\nMentally divide squares into two triangles, and dock the center of one triangle several times with a fork. Place a heaping tablespoon of filling in the docked side of each square. Fold it over on the diagonal into a triangle and crimp edges by pressing the back of a fork's tines firmly against pastry. Poke top with tip of knife to create a small steam hole. Rub a thin coating of syrup on top of each square. Repeat with remaining sheets of puff pastry.\nBake turnovers on parchment-lined sheet pans for 30 minutes, or until well-browned, very flaky, and dry and firm to the touch. Halfway through baking swap top and bottom pans to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. Cool on cooling racks and store in an airtight container. If stacking turnovers, it is best to separate with a sheet of wax or parchment paper.\nSpecial equipment\nfood processor, rolling pin\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Orange Blossom Water\nPastries\nPistachios\nWalnuts\nDesserts",
