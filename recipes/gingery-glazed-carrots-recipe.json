When liquid boils, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are almost completely tender (carrots should give very little resistance when poked with a cake tester or knife), about 10 minutes. If liquid drops to below 1/2-inch during cooking, top up with a cup of hot water.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nRemove lid and continue cooking carrots at a rapid boil. Combine cornstarch with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and stir with a fork until homogenous. Pour cornstarch mixture into carrots and stir to combine. Continue cooking until sauce is reduced to a syrupy glaze. Pick out thyme sprigs and discard. Off heat, add lemon juice and stir to combine. Season to taste with more salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish and serve.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nNotes\nFeel free to vary the flavorings as desired. Omit ginger and thyme and replace with other herbs or spices (orange zest works well, as does star anise, fennel, chiles, etc.).\nFor tips on how to cut carrots, check out our\nKnife Skills: Carrots\n, and for ginger, our\nKnife Skills: Ginger\nguides.\nIf carrots sit in the pan for too long after cooking, there's a chance the liquid will over-reduce and thicken or break. If this occurs, add a few tablespoons of hot water and stir to combine. The sauce should come back together to the right consistency.\nRead More\nHow to Cut Carrots\nHow to Prepare and Store Ginger\nVegetable Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop Vegetables\nCarrots\nThanksgiving Side Dishes",
