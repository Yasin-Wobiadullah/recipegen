  "full_text": "Malted Barley Dark Rye Sandwich Loaf Recipe | Bread Baking\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n45 mins\nProofing Time\n2 hrs 15 mins\nTotal\n3 hrs 20 mins\nServes\n10\nto 12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nlukewarm\nwater\n2 1/2\nteaspoons\nyeast\n1\ntablespoon\npale chocolate barley malt\n1/2\ncup\ndark rye flour\n1/2\ncup\nrye flakes\n2\ntablespoons\nsugar\n2\ncups\nbread flour\n2\nteaspoons\nsalt\n1/4\ncup\nGreek-style\u00a0yogurt\n1\ntablespoon\nolive oil\nDirections\nIn the bowl of your stand mixer, combine water, yeast, barley malt, rye flour, rye flakes, and sugar. Whisk to combine it all, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set aside for a hour. It will be bubbling vigorously and look like something that dinosaurs used to fall into.\nAdd the bread flour, salt, yogurt, and olive oil. Knead with the dough hook until the dough gathers around the dough hook, cleans the sides of the bowl, and becomes elastic. It will still be sticky.\nDrizzle with a little more olive oil to cover all sides of the dough in the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap again, and set aside until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and sprinkle cornmeal on the bottom of a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.\nSprinkle flour on your work surface and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead the dough by hand a bit, then form into a log that will fit the length of the loaf pan, and place it in the pan.\nCover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside until it has risen to just above the top of the pan, about 30 minutes.\nWhen the loaf has fully risen (if you poke the side of the dough gently with a fingertip, the indent will stay rather than bouncing back), slash the top of the loaf as desired and bake at 350\u00b0F for 35 to 45 minutes, until nicely browned and the loaf sound hollow when tapped.\nRemove the loaf from the pan and cool completely on a rack before slicing.\nYeast Breads\nRye",
