Cover and let stand overnight.\nDrain the beans, reserving the water in which they soaked. Measure the water and add enough additional water to total 8 cups.\nIn a Dutch oven, combine beans, 8 cups water, and ham hocks and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally and skimming the surface as necessary to remove any foam, until beans are very tender, about 4 hours. Top up with boiling water as needed to keep the beans from going dry.\nMeanwhile, in a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add chopped yellow onions and green peppers. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.\nAfter the beans have cooked about 2 hours, add the onion mixture to the beans. Add the bay leaves, pepper flakes, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.\nWhen the beans are almost tender, add rum and cook, stirring and scraping bottom often, 30 minutes longer. The beans should have thickened nicely, being neither dry nor soupy.\nRemove the ham hocks. When they are cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin, fat, bones and gristle. Shred the meat and return it to the beans. Remove the bay leaves. Add the cayenne pepper and Tabasco. Serve with white rice and top with diced white onions, if desired.\nBlack Beans\nCuban\nBraised & Stewed Beans\nHam\nWhite Rice",
