Add the pork, veal, and lamb, and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up large chunks of meat until cooked through, about 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat another 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until smoking. Add chicken livers and sage and cook, stirring constantly, until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer contents to pot with cooking meats. Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to skillet and heat over high heat until shimmering. Add onion, celery, and carrots and cook, stirring and flipping frequently until beginning to soften but not browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to pot with meats and stir to combine.\nAdd wine to meats and bring to a boil over high heat. Allow to reduce until almost gone, about 15 minutes. Add chicken stock, veal stock, tomatoes, and half of basil and parsley. Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors are married and sauce is reduced to a thick, spoon-coating consistency, about 2 hours.\nAdd butter and heavy cream and bring to a boil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For best flavor, remove from heat, allow to cool, and refrigerate at least overnight, and up to three nights. Fat will settle on top. Do not discard fat; stir it back into the sauce as you reheat it.\nReheat, stir in remaining basil and parsley, and serve over tagliatelle, pappardelle, or gnocchi with Parmigiano-Reggiano, torn basil, and freshly ground black pepper.\nItalian\nStovetop Pasta\nVeal\nChicken\nGround Lamb",
