(Spice paste should have the texture of cooked oatmeal; use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. If the paste isn\u2019t coming together, add water 1 tablespoon at a time.)\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor the Rendang:\nIn a 5- or 6-quart Dutch oven, combine spice paste, coconut milk, makrut lime leaves, lemongrass, cinnamon stick, and tamarind. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and add beef, stirring to evenly coat with sauce. (Don\u2019t worry if beef isn\u2019t completely submerged.)\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nTransfer to oven and cook, uncovered, until sauce is reduced and a puddle of oil appears on the surface, about 2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes.\u00a0 At this point, the dish is ready to eat; you can stop cooking here or, for a more traditional rendang, proceed with the remaining steps.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nWearing oven mitts, carefully transfer pot to stovetop and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Using a flexible, heat-proof spatula, stir and scrape the bottom and sides frequently, and cook, uncovered, until the meat is tender, the sauce has reduced and darkened, and any remaining sauce is clinging to the beef, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Serve immediately with white rice and sambal, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\nSpice grinder or mortar and pestle, food processor, 5-quart Dutch oven\nNotes\nAsian shallots are about 1 1/2 inches long and are much smaller than regular shallots. They can be purchased at Asian grocery stores.\nMildly toxic when raw, candlenuts (kemiri) are used as a thickener in Indonesian cooking. In Hawaii, it is known as kukui nut and is a common ingredient in poke. You can find candlenuts at Asian grocery stores specializing in Southeast Asian cuisines and online. Macadamias, another mild tasting nut with a high oil content, have a similar texture when pounded and are a good substitute.\nYou can add 4 ounces (150g) baby or new potatoes if desired. Scrub the skins clean, and halve them if they are large. Add to the sauce at the same time as the beef.\nMakrut lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal and \u201cwet\u201d tamarind are available at well-stocked grocery stores and Asian markets. If you can find daun salam (dried Indonesian salam leaves) and/or dried or fresh turmeric leaves, you can add 2 to 3 of each to the stew for an even more aromatic rendang.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nRendang can be made over several days. The spice paste can be made up to 2 days ahead and stored in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. The rendang can be prepared through step 4 up to 3 days in advance; cool it to room temperature and transfer it to the refrigerator. To continue cooking, proceed with step 5 of the recipe.\nRendang can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week and frozen for up to 6 months.\nThe Latest\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nSoutheast Asian\nIndonesian\nCoconut Milk & Cream",
