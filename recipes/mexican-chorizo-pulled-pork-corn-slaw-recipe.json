Rub the spice blend all over the pork (see note). Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add pork in batches and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate. Reduce heat to medium, add the onions and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen the browned bits, until the onions are softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook, stirring, for 1 minute.\nReturn the pork to the pot and pour in the beer. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cover and transfer the pot to the oven. Cook until the pork shreds easily with two forks, about 3 hours.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nStrain the pork mixture and reserve the liquid. Shred the pork and set aside. Return the liquid to the pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Combine cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water and whisk into the braising liquid. Continue to simmer until thickened, then mix in the apple cider vinegar, adding more to taste if desired. Stir in the shredded pork.\nServe on buns or in tortillas with the corn slaw.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Eisenberg\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nThe spice mixture can temporarily stain your skin, so wear disposable gloves if you'd like to protect your hands while rubbing the pork with the spices.\nRead More\nEasy Oven-Cooked Pulled Pork\nSlow-Cooker Pulled Pork With Dr Pepper\nSous Vide Barbecue Pulled Pork Shoulder\nLow-and-Slow Pulled Pork (Smoked Pork Shoulder)\nPork Mains\nMexican\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork Shoulder\nCorn"
