In a medium bowl, whisk cornstarch and sugar; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or using a hand mixer and a large bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar and salt on medium speed until light, fluffy, and soft peaks form, about 5 minutes. With the mixer still running on medium, gradually add sugar and cornstarch mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Continue beating until meringue is thick, glossy, and holds firm peaks when you lift the whisk, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Using a flexible spatula, scrape bottom and sides of the bowl.
