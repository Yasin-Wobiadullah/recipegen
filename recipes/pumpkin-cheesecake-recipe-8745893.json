Line exterior of pan with foil.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nBake crust until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to cooling rack and cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes.\nFor the Filling:\nPlace clean kitchen towel in roasting pan. Set tea kettle or pot of water to boil.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nIn bowl of stand mixer or large bowl, whip egg whites and salt with whisk attachment on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gradually add 1/2 cup (100g) sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes longer. If you used the stand mixer bowl, transfer whites to separate bowl.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nWith paddle attachment, beat cream cheese, remaining 1/2 cup (100g) sugar, and egg yolks on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the flour, orange zest, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, and beat until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add the pumpkin pur\u00e9e, sour cream, and vanilla and continue beating until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes longer, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl with rubber spatula as necessary.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nStir 1/3 of egg whites into cream cheese mixture, then gently fold in remaining egg whites.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nScrape batter into cooled crust and place in prepared roasting pan. Pour hot water into pan. Bake until cheesecake is set but still a bit wobbly in the center, 75 to 90 minutes. Transfer roasting pan to cooling rack and allow cheesecake to sit in pan 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nRemove cheesecake from roasting pan and gently set on cooling rack. Cool completely in pan, 1 to 2 hours. Refrigerate cheesecake until completely chilled and set, at least 3 hours.\nFor the Spiced Walnuts and Assembly:\nWhile the cheesecake cools, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk egg white, orange juice, and salt to combine. Add nuts and toss to coat. Using a colander, drain nuts.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nIn a second medium bowl, combine sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Add nuts and toss to coat. Arrange in single layer on prepared baking sheet and bake until crisp, 30 to 40 minutes.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nTransfer to cooling rack and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Break nuts apart and coarsely chop.\nHeat syrup in microwave for 20 seconds. Brush over cooled cheesecake and sprinkle with nuts. Serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, 9-inch round springform pan,\ncooling rack\n,\nstand mixer\nNotes\nIt is crucial that the cream cheese be completely softened\u2014firm cream cheese will not produce a smooth batter. I prefer standard pumpkin pur\u00e9e over organic for this recipe\u2014I found it richer in flavor and more concentrated in color. Don't be alarmed: the cheesecake will shrink as it cools.\nPumpkin\nDesserts\nFall\nFall Desserts\nCheesecakes",
