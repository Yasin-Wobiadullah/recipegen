Season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking until foaming just subsides, about 30 seconds. Stir in parsley or basil and set aside.\nWhen ready to serve, season burger patties generously with salt and pepper and cook burgers to desired doneness on a hot grill or in a skillet on the stovetop, 125\u00b0F for medium rare or 135\u00b0F for medium. Transfer to a plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes.\nAdjust rack to 6 inches below element and heat broiler to high. Brush burger buns on both cut surfaces with garlic butter and place cut-side-up on a broiler pan. Add burgers and top with provolone cheese. Broil burgers and buns just until cheese melts, about 45 seconds. Return burgers to plate and continue broiling buns until well browned and bubbling, about 1 minute longer.\nPlace burgers on bottom buns. Top with pepperoni sauce and shards of parmesan cheese. Close burgers and serve.\nBurgers\nGrilled Beef",
