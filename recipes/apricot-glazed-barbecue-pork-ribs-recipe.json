Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nAdd apricot preserves, ketchup, honey, vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, jalape\u00f1o jam, chipotles, adobo sauce, and mustard and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened slightly, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nPur\u00e9e sauce with an immersion blender, or transfer sauce to the jar of a regular blender, and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let cool to room temperature, transfer to a jar or container, and refrigerate until ready to use; sauce can be made in advance and refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nFor the Rub:\nMix together rub ingredients in a small bowl.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nFor the Ribs:\nRemove membrane from back of each rack of ribs and trim meat of excess fat. Generously season ribs all over with rub mixture.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nFire up a\nsmoker\nor\ngrill\nto 225\u00b0F, adding chunks of smoking wood when at temperature. When the wood is ignited and producing smoke, place the ribs in smoker or grill, meaty side up, and smoke until the ribs have turned a deep mahogany color, 2-3 hours. Spray ribs with apple juice and continue smoking, spraying the ribs with apple juice every 45-60 minutes, until they bend slightly when lifted from one end, about 2-3 hours longer; during the last 30 minutes of cooking, brush top of each rack with sauce. Remove from smoker, slice, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion blender, grill or smoker, spray bottle\nRead More\nKansas City-Style Barbecue Ribs\nSous Vide Barbecue Pork Ribs\nOven Barbecue Pork Ribs\nPork\nGrilled Pork\nMemorial Day"
