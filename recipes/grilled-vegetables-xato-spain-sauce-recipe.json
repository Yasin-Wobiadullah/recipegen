Alternatively, set all burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil\ngrilling grate.\nPlace almond and hazelnut packets on the cooler side of grill and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly brown and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place chiles and tomato halves over hot side of grill and cook, turning occasionally, until chiles are dark and blistered on all sides and tomato is charred in spots, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then discard seeds and stems from chiles.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSet bread over hot side of grill and cook, turning, until toasted on both sides.\nIn a blender, combine chiles (see note), tomato, almonds, hazelnuts, bread, garlic, sherry vinegar, and 1/4 cup cold water. Blend until a thick pur\u00e9e forms, then add olive oil and blend until incorporated. Season with salt. You should have about 2 cups sauce, which can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week.\n\ufeffSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo make the salad, lightly dress endives and spring onions with olive oil, then grill over high heat, turning, until charred in spots. Chop endives and spring onions and transfer to a serving bowl. Spoon a generous dollop of sauce on top, add anchovies, if using, and serve. Salad can be warm or at room temperature. The remaining sauce can be used as a condiment for sandwiches, a dip for vegetables, and more.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill\n,\nblender\nNotes\nFresno chiles are relatively mild, though some can be hotter than others. It may be a good idea to grill two peppers, but then start by blending one into the sauce, tasting, and adding the second only if desired at that point.\nSpanish\nGrilled Vegetables\nAlmonds\nAnchovies\nEndive, Radicchio & Chicories",
