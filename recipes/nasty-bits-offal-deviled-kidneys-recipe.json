For lamb's kidneys, quarter them. For pig's kidneys, cut into bite-size chunks, approximately 1-inch across.\nHeat a little fat in a frying pat and add the kidneys, sauteing for just a brief minute to brown. Add the wine and let it bubble for 30 seconds. Add the vinegar and simmer for 10 to 20 seconds.\nAdd the jelly, mustard, and cayenne pepper, stirring the kidneys to mix all of the elements together. Add the Worcestershire sauce, and let the liquid simmer for 20 seconds until it is slightly reduced. Taste for balance. Depending on your taste for kidneys, you may want to add more sour or spicy elements.\nFinish by taking the pan off the heat and adding in the heavy cream, stirring to mix.\nServe with toast or rice, garnishing with parsley if desired.\nLamb\nStovetop\nPork"
