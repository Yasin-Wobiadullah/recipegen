Add cinnamon, star anise, 1 knob of ginger, and 2 scallions. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Lower heat to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is lightly syrupy and coats the back of a spoon, about 40 minutes. Set aside.\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Scatter 2/3 of onions and celery across pan. Place a wire rack directly on top of vegetables.\nPat turkey dry with paper towels. Rub 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil all over turkey. Using a pastry brush, apply a thin layer of glaze to underside of turkey only. Place turkey skin side up on top of rack, tuck wing tips behind back, and arrange so turkey does not overlap the baking sheet edges, pressing down on breastbone to flatten breasts slightly.\nTransfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into deepest part of breast registers 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) and thighs register at least 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), about 1 hour 20 minutes. During last 20 minutes of cooking, apply several coats of glaze all over turkey skin with pastry brush, roasting for 5 minutes between each coat, until turkey is covered in a deep-brown, sticky glaze.\nWhile turkey roasts, make jus. Roughly chop reserved neck, backbone, and giblets. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a 3-quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add remaining onions, celery, ginger, and scallions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, about 5 minutes longer. Add chicken stock, bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Simmer until reduced by half, about 40 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a 2-quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from surface of broth. Season jus to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm.\nWhen turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and discard. Whisk juices into jus.\nCarve turkey and serve with jus.\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nwire rack\n, pastry brush,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nRead More\nSpatchcocked (Butterflied) Roast Turkey With Gravy Recipe\nThe Best Simple Roast Turkey With Gravy Recipe\nPorchetta-Flavored Spatchcocked Turkey Recipe\nCajun-Spiced Spatchcocked Turkey Recipe\nThe Food Lab's Definitive Guide to Buying, Prepping, Cooking, and Carving Your Holiday Turkey\nThe Right Way to Brine Turkey\nThanksgiving Turkeys"
