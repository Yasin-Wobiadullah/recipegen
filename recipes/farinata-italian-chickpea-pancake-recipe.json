  "full_text": "Farinata (Italian Chickpea Pancake) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n11 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nResting Time\n4 hrs 10 mins\nTotal\n4 hrs 36 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8 ounces (2 cups;\n226\ng\n) finely ground chickpea (garbanzo bean)\nflour\n1\nteaspoon\n(3g) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\n710\nml\nwater\n60\nml\nextra virgin olive oil\n1\ntsp, ground\nground black pepper\n1\ntsp\nrosemary\nDirections\nIn a mixing bowl, combine chickpea flour and salt. Gradually add water, whisking constantly, until a smooth, thin batter forms. Let stand, covered, at least 4 and up to 8 hours.\nPreheat oven to 550\u00b0F (288\u00b0C) and position oven rack in second position from top. If you have a pizza stone or baking steel, set it on the rack (it will help crisp the farinata from below, but isn't required).\nPour olive oil into a well-seasoned large 12-inch cast iron skillet and swirl to fully coat bottom in an even layer. Using a spoon, scrape any foam from surface of batter and discard. Stir batter to mix well, then pour into skillet. Stir gently to swirl oil on top of batter. Season all over with black pepper and sprinkle with rosemary leaves, if using.\nTurn on broiler. Set skillet on pizza stone or baking steel, or on the oven rack if not using a stone, and cook until farinata has just set, no longer jiggles, and is browned all over, 11 to 15 minutes.\nLet farinata cool slightly until set, about 10 minutes. Eat warm or at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nCast iron skillet\n,\nbaking steel\n(optional)\nNotes\nIf your broiler cycles off, you can prop the oven door open with a utensil to keep it on the whole time.\nItalian\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nSavory\nChickpeas",
