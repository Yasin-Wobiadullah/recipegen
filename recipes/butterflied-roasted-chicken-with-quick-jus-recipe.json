Using sharp kitchen shears, remove backbone from chicken and cut spine into 5 to 6 one-inch-long pieces. Set backbone aside. Flatten chicken by placing skin side up on a cutting board and applying firm pressure to breastbone. Transfer to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Position chicken so that breasts are aligned with center of baking sheet and legs are close to edge.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIf using herbs: using your fingers and starting from the neck end and working your way down towards the legs, gently separate chicken skin from the breast and thigh meat; be careful not to tear the skin. Carefully push the herbs under the skin, distributing them as evenly as possible all over the breast and thigh muscle.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCombine 1 tablespoon (15g) kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, and 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder (if using) in a small bowl. Sprinkle all over chicken skin and cavity sides, then return to skin-up position. If dry brining, transfer chicken to refrigerator and let sit, uncovered, for at least 3 and up to 24 hours; otherwise proceed with cooking right away.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nDrizzle chicken skin with 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil, rubbing to distribute evenly. Roast chicken until thickest part of breast close to bone registers 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer and joint between thighs and body registers at least 175\u00b0F (80\u00b0C), about 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a small saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chicken backbone and cook, stirring frequently, until well browned, about 3 minutes. Add onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Add bay leaf and deglaze with vermouth or sherry and 1 cup (240ml) water, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Reduce heat to maintain simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Strain out solids and return liquid to pan. Boil over medium-high heat until approximately 1/3 cup (80ml) remains, about 7 minutes. Whisk in soy sauce, butter, and lemon juice off heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nRemove chicken from oven, transfer to cutting board, tent loosely with foil, and allow to rest 5 minutes before carving. Serve with hot jus.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\nWire rack\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nAdding baking powder to the salt used on the chicken skin will give you extra-crispy results.\nIf using a different type of salt, be sure to use the weight measurement, not the volume measurement.\nRead More\nPerfect Roast Chicken Recipe\nPollo al Mattone (Italian Roast Chicken Under a Brick) Recipe\nPan-Roasted Chicken With Vegetables and Dijon Jus Recipe\nKnow Your Chicken: What USDA Poultry Labels Actually Mean\nRoasted Chicken\nWhole Chicken\nChicken Mains\nFall Mains\nWinter Mains"
