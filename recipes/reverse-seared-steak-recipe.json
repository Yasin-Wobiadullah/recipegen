  "full_text": "Reverse-Seared Steak\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n1\nto 2 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 to 2\nThick-cut beef\nsteak\n(s), at least 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick, such as ribeye, strip, porterhouse, T-bone, tri-tip, or filet mignon\nKosher salt\nand freshly ground black pepper\nVegetable oil\n(if finishing on the stovetop; optional)\n1\ntablespoon\n(\n15\ng\n)\nunsalted butter\n(if finishing on the stovetop; optional)\nDirections\nGenerously season steak(s) all over with salt and pepper. If desired, set steak(s) on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight to dry out the exterior. Otherwise, proceed with the next step.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIf Cooking in the Oven:\nSet steak(s) on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Preheat oven to anywhere between 200 and 275\u00b0F (93 and 135\u00b0C); if your oven goes lower, you can set it to an even lower temperature, though it will take longer to cook.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPlace steak(s) in the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 105\u00b0F (41\u00b0C) for rare, 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) for medium-rare, 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) for medium, or 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for medium-well. This will take about 20 minutes for rare steak and up to about 40 minutes for medium-well; cooking time can vary dramatically depending on many factors, so check often. (For approximate cooking times,\nsee the chart above\n.)\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nJust before steak(s) come out of the oven, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil to a cast iron, carbon steel, or heavy stainless steel skillet and heat over high heat until smoking. Add steak(s) and butter to skillet and cook until each side is well browned, about 45 seconds per side. Using tongs, hold steak(s) sideways to sear edges. Serve right away; there's no need to let reverse-seared steaks rest.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIf Cooking on the Grill:\nLight one chimney full of charcoal.\nWhen all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.\nClean and oil grilling grate\n.\nSet steak(s) on cooler side of grill and let cook uncovered, turning occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer registers 105\u00b0F (41\u00b0C) for rare, 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) for medium-rare, 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) for medium, or 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for medium-well. Cooking time can vary greatly, so check the steaks often.\nTransfer steak(s) to a platter and tent with foil. If you are using a charcoal grill and your coals have died down, build up the biggest fire you can. If using a gas grill, make sure all burners are turned to their highest heat and allow the grill to preheat with the lid closed.\nReturn steak(s) to the hottest part of the grill and cook, turning frequently, until crisp and charred all over, about 1 1/2 minutes total. Serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nWire rack\nand\nrimmed baking sheet\n(if dry-brining or cooking in the oven);\ncast iron pan\n,\ncarbon steel skillet\n, or heavy\nstainless steel skillet\n(if finishing on the stovetop);\ncharcoal grill\nand\nchimney starter\n(if cooking on the grill);\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nThe Best Ways to Cook Steak, Explained\nSous Vide Steaks Recipe\nThe Food Lab's Definitive Guide to Grilled Steak\nDry-Brining Is the Best Way to Brine Meat, Poultry, and More\nHow to Dry Age Beef\nFour Expensive Steak Cuts to Know\nRoasted Beef\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nStovetop Beef\nSteaks"
