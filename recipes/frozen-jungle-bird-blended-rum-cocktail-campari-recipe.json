Seal and freeze at least 4 and up to 10 hours.\nWhen ready to serve, pour chilled cocktail mixture into blender. Add 8 ice cubes and blend until uniform. Divide between 2 glasses. Serve immediately with pineapple-leaf garnish, if desired.\nNotes\nDon't use canned pineapple juice; it lacks the rich tropical flavor of the fresh stuff and throws the drink out of balance, resulting in a cocktail that's flat and a little metallic. To make fresh pineapple juice, simply muddle pineapple chunks and strain through a fine-mesh strainer.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender, muddler, fine-mesh strainer, resealable container (10 ounces or larger)\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Frozen Jungle Bird: Frosty, Tropical, and Pure Tiki-Drink Fun\nFrozen Drinks\nPineapple\nRum\nSummer Drinks",
