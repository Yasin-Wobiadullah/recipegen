Stir occasionally with a fork until sugar dissolves and syrup is bubbling hard, about 2 minutes. Stop stirring and simmer until syrup turns pale gold, like clover honey, roughly 8 minutes. Meanwhile, measure out cream so it will be ready to add at a moment's notice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen syrup turns pale gold, add cream and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula, until the foam subsides and the boiling caramel seems more molten than foamy, about 6 minutes. Clip-on a digital thermometer and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until caramel registers 245\u00b0F (118\u00b0C), about 5 minutes more.\nImmediately transfer caramel to a heat-resistant bowl and allow to cool until it registers 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C)on a digital thermometer, about 40 minutes. Stir in milk chocolate until fully melted, then fold in rice.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nDivide into about 15 one-ounce (2-tablespoon) portions and arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan or cutting board, then flatten into disks with the palm of your hand. Let stand at room temperature until fully set, about 1 hour, and transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of parchment between each layer. Star Crunch will keep up to a week at room temperature, or a month if refrigerated.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n, heat-resistant spatula,\nclip-on digital thermometer\nNotes\nThis recipe requires good-quality milk chocolate, free from artificial ingredients and added fats such as palm oil. Look for brands with no less than 26% cocoa butter, or see\nour favorite supermarket milk chocolates for baking\n.\nCookies\nChristmas Cookies\nChocolate\nCandy\nChristmas Candies",
