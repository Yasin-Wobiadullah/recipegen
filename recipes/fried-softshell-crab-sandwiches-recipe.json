In a medium bowl, combine 1/2 cup (65g) flour with cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, baking powder, and paprika, and whisk to combine. Place remaining 1/2 cup flour in a shallow bowl.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd crabs to plain flour and toss gently to coat. Add beer to flour/cornstarch mixture and whisk until a batter has just formed; it's okay if a few small lumps of dry flour remain.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWorking with one at a time, lift a crab from flour and shake off excess. Dip in batter, turning to coat, then lift, allowing excess batter to drain back into bowl. Carefully lower crab into hot oil. Repeat with remaining crabs.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCook, turning at least once, until batter is golden and crispy on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Using a slotted fish spatula, transfer crabs to paper towels to drain and sprinkle immediately with salt.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSmear top and bottom of each bun with mayo, tartar sauce, or remoulade. Add shredded lettuce to each bottom bun, followed by a slice or two of tomato. Top each with a fried crab and close sandwiches. Serve right away.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant-read thermometer, slotted fish spatula\nRead More\nSaut\u00e9ed Soft-Shell Crabs With Lemon Butter Pan Sauce\nA Beginner's Guide to Soft Shell Crabs\nHow to Make the Best Seafood Po' Boys\nCrab\nNorth American\nAmerican\nFried Seafood\nSeafood Mains",
