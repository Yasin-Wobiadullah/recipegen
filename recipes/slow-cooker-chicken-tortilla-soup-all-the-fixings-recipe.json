Add beer, raise heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.\nTransfer to the slow cooker along with the bay leaves, thyme, chipotle pepper, tomatoes, tomato paste, vinegar, green chiles, and chicken stock. Season with salt and pepper. Cook on low setting or until chicken is cooked through and fall-apart tender, at least 4 hours.\nDiscard bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Shred chicken using two forks. Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed.\nLadle soup into bowls and garnish with avocado, onion, cilantro, cheddar and a sprinkle of tortilla chips.
