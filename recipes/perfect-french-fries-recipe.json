  "full_text": "Perfect Thin and Crispy French Fries Recipe\nJump to recipe\nCook\n30 mins\nActive\n40 mins\nDrying and Cooling Time\n35 mins\nTotal\n65 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\npounds\nrusset potatoes\n(\n900\ng\n; about\n4\nlarge\npotatoes\n), peeled and cut into 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch fries (keep raw potato sticks submerged in a bowl of water after cutting)\n2\ntablespoons\n(\n30\nml\n) distilled\nwhite vinegar\nKosher salt\n2\nquarts\n(\n1.9\nL\n)\npeanut oil\nDirections\nPlace potatoes and vinegar in a saucepan and add 2 quarts (1.9L) water and 2 tablespoons (24g) salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Potatoes should be fully tender, but not falling apart. Drain and spread on a paper towel\u2013lined rimmed baking sheet. Allow to dry for 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat oil in a 6- or 7-quart Dutch oven or large wok over high heat to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). Add one-third of fries to oil; oil temperature should drop to around 360\u00b0F (182\u00b0C). Cook for 50 seconds, agitating occasionally with a wire mesh spider, then remove to a second paper towel\u2013lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining potatoes (working in 2 more batches), allowing oil to return to 400\u00b0F after each addition. Allow potatoes to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Continue with step 3, or, for best results, freeze potatoes at least overnight or up to 2 months.\nReturn oil to 400\u00b0F over high heat. Fry half of potatoes until crisp and light golden brown, about 3 1/2 minutes, adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of around 360\u00b0F. Drain in a bowl lined with paper towels and season immediately with kosher salt. Cooked fries can be kept hot and crisp on a wire rack set in a sheet tray in a 200\u00b0F (90\u00b0C) oven while second batch is cooked. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nBasic slicer or\nfully equipped mandoline\n(optional),\nDutch oven\nor\nwok\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\n, wire rack,\ninstant-read thermometer\n,\nwire mesh spider\nRead More\nKnife Skills: How to Cut French Fries\nRusset Potatoes\nDairy-free Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nFrying"
