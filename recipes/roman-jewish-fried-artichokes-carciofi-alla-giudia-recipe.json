Trim artichokes following\nRoman-Jewish artichoke guidelines shown here\n: Remove tough dark green outer leaves to expose more tender light-green leaves within, then, using a paring knife, cut off top half of each leaf and trim base and stem.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTrimmed artichokes will look like a closed rosebud. Transfer the peeled artichokes to the bowl of lemon water as you work, covering them with a clean kitchen towel to keep them completely submerged.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a large saucepan, heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 280\u00b0F (130\u00b0C). Add artichokes (they should produce a steady but non-violent stream of bubbles) and cook until tender (you should be able to pierce their hearts easily with a fork), adjusting heat to maintain a steady bubble, about 10 minutes for baby artichokes and 15 minutes for larger ones. Turn larger artichokes frequently for even cooking.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing a slotted spoon or spider, transfer artichokes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let stand until cool enough to handle. Using your hands, gently pull open each artichoke \"bud\" so that it resembles an open flower. If using large artichokes, remove and discard the hair \"choke\" in the center of the artichoke. Increase oil temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFry artichokes until browned and crisp, 2 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season immediately with salt. Transfer to plates and serve right away with wedges of remaining lemon.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nOlive oil is more traditional and will give more of the characteristics of Mediterranean flavor, whereas neutral oils like vegetable or canola oil will let more of the pure artichoke flavor shine through.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge deep saucepan, wire mesh spider or slotted spoon,\nprobe\nor\ninstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nHow to Clean, Trim, and Prepare Artichokes | Knife Skills\nOld-Fashioned Latkes\nArtichoke\nRecipes By Ingredients\nFrying\nItalian\nStovetop Vegetables",
