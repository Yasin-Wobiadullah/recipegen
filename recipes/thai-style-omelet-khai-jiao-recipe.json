Beat with a fork until frothy. If the flour forms a few lumps, break up as many as possible with your fingers.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a small pot or a round-bottom wok set over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Hold the egg bowl about one foot above the pan and pour the egg mixture into the oil in one go.\nThe egg mixture will immediately puff up. Do not disturb it. After 20 seconds, flip the omelet. There\u2019s no need to keep it nice and round; we want asymmetrical edges. Let the other side cook for another 20 seconds. Remove the omelet from the pan and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nor\nsaucier\nRead More\nYam Khai Dao (Thai Fried Egg Salad) Recipe\nThai Fried Hard-Boiled Eggs in Tamarind Sauce Recipe\nOmelettes\nThai"
