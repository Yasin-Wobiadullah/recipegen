Lower heat if skillet gets too hot and begins to smoke.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStir in panko bread crumbs to evenly coat in bacon fat and cook, stirring and tossing, until bread crumbs are lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool. Season very lightly with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Clams:\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan, cook 2 ounces diced bacon over medium-high heat until fat has rendered and bacon is lightly browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until shallots have softened, about 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd white wine and clams, cover, and cook, checking occasionally, until the clams begin to open. Using tongs, transfer opened clams to a large bowl to cool, continuing to cover saut\u00e9 pan and checking frequently for newly opened clams. Continue until last clams have opened. (Some may open only a crack; this is fine, just pry the shell fully open. Discard clams that have a foul odor or are filled with mud.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUncover saut\u00e9 pan and cook, stirring, until wine and clam liquid have evaporated and the shallot-bacon mixture has become jammy. Remove from heat and allow to cool.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a medium bowl, stir shallot-bacon mixture and 1/4 cup parsley into softened butter until thoroughly incorporated. Season lightly with salt and pepper. (Clams can be salty, so be careful not to over-season.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWorking one at a time, pry off top shell of each clam and discard, making sure no shell fragments from the hinge fall into the clam. Free each clam from the bottom shell, then set back in the bottom shell and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing a butter knife, pack clam butter all around and over each clam, sealing each into the bottom shell. Sprinkle a small amount of bacon bread crumbs on top of each clam, pressing lightly to adhere. At this point, you can cover the baking sheet with plastic and refrigerate clams for up to 1 day before cooking. (You will have clam butter left over; keep it refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 1 week. It's delicious tossed with spaghetti for an easy weeknight meal.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen ready to serve, place clams in a 450\u00b0F oven and cook until butter is melted and clams are fully heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir remaining 1/4 cup parsley into bread crumbs, then sprinkle a generous amount on top of each clam. Return to oven for 1 minute to warm bread crumbs, then serve right away with lemon wedges.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nTo purge clams, submerge them in a large container of salted cold water and let stand for 30 minutes. Lift out clams. If there is no sand in the bottom of the container, they're ready to scrub and use. If there is sand, drain and rinse the container, fill it with fresh salted water, and return the clams for 30 more minutes. Continue this process until the water is clear and free of sand.\nRead More\nRhode Island-Style Stuffed Quahog Clams (\"Stuffies\")\nFritto Misto di Mare (Fried Mixed Seafood)\nFried Calamari with Red Sauce\nClams\nNew England\nBacon\nSnacks & Appetizers"
