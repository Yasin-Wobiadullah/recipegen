  "full_text": "Latkes with Caviar and Cream From 'Joy of Kosher'\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nTotal\n45 mins\nServes\n20 latkes\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nlarge\nrusset potatoes\n(about\n2 1/2\npounds\n)\n3\nlarge\neggs\n, beaten\n2\nteaspoons\nkosher salt\n1\nteaspoon\nfreshly\nground black pepper\nCanola oil\n, for frying (use olive or vegetable oil for Passover)\n1\nmedium\nonion\n, quartered\n1/4\ncup\nfine cornmeal\nor\nmatzoh meal\n(use matzoh for Passover)\n1 1/4\ncups\ncr\u00e8me fr\u00e2iche\nor\nsour cream\nCaviar\n, for garnish\nDirections\nFill a large bowl with cold water. Peel the potatoes, cut them into quarters lengthwise, and place them in the bowl of cold water to prevent browning.\nCombine the eggs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; set aside.\nHeat about 1 inch of the canola oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat.\nPut the onion and potatoes in a food processor and pulse until pur\u00e9ed. Transfer the mixture to the large bowl with the eggs. Add the cornmeal or matzoh meal and mix to combine.\nLine a baking sheet with paper towels.\nUsing a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop up the potato mixture and carefully drop it into the hot oil. Use the back of the measuring cup to flatten the latke. Fill the pan with as many latkes as you can, but do not let them touch. Do not overcrowd your pan, or the latkes will be soggy instead of crispy. Fry until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter.\nTo keep the latkes warm and crispy once fried, spread them in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in a 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C) oven until ready to serve.\nTo serve, place the latkes on a large serving tray and garnish each with a generous tablespoon of cr\u00e8me fr\u00e2iche and caviar.\nPotatoes",
