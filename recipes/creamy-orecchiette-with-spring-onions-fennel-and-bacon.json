Using tongs, transfer bacon to a cutting board and reserve rendered bacon fat in the pan. Cut bacon crosswise into 3/4-inch pieces; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nReturn pan to stovetop and increase heat to medium-high. Add white and light green spring onion parts, fennel, and water, season with salt and cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until vegetables just begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add baking soda, stir to combine, and continue to cook until vegetables are very soft and beginning to break down, about 8 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd remaining green parts of spring onions. Cook until well-incorporated with vegetable mixture and just beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add cream, bring to a simmer, and cook until mixture is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer mixture to a blender and blend on high speed until smooth and emulsified, about 1 minute. Season lightly with salt. Wipe out saut\u00e9 pan and transfer blended sauce back to the pan, passing through a fine-mesh strainer if desired. Warm sauce over low heat, occasionally scraping down the sides of the pan to prevent skin from forming.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook orecchiette until just shy of al dente (about 1 minute less than the package directs). Reserve pasta cooking water.\nTransfer pasta to pan along with 1/2 cup pasta water and bacon, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring rapidly until sauce has thickened slightly and pasta is well-coated, about 1 minute. Remove from heat, season generously with pepper, add Parmigiano, and stir rapidly to combine. Season with salt, if needed. Divide pasta into serving bowls and garnish with reserved fennel fronds. Serve immediately, passing more cheese at the table.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStraight-sided saut\u00e9 pan\nor\nDutch oven\n,\nblender\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nSpring onions resemble scallions in appearance and flavor, but they're actually just very young storage onions that are pulled out of the ground at an earlier date, when they're still thin-skinned and mild in flavor. If you can't find spring onions, leeks or scallions can be used as substitutes.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe finished pasta is best enjoyed immediately, but the blended sauce (without cheese) can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Reheat gently before finishing with pasta, pasta water, pepper, and cheese.\nRead More\nPasta Primavera (Pasta With Spring Vegetables) Recipe\nGemelli with Asparagus, Ricotta, Arugula, and Lemon Zest Recipe\nPenne With Melted-Vegetable Sauce Recipe\nCreamy Pastas\nHolidays & Seasons\nSpring Mains\nBacon\nFennel"
