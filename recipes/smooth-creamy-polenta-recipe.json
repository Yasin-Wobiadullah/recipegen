  "full_text": "Smooth and Creamy Polenta\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n65 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nChilling Time\n5 hrs\nTotal\n6 hrs 10 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n5\ncups\n(\n1.2\nL\n)\nwater\n, milk, or\nchicken stock\nor\nvegetable stock\n(see notes)\n1\ncup\n(\n5\nounces\n;\n140\ng\n) medium or coarse\ncornmeal/polenta\n(see notes)\nKosher salt\n2\ntablespoons\n(\n1\nounce\n;\n30\ng\n) unsalted butter or\nextra-virgin olive oil\n, plus more oil to sear or grill, if desired\nAccompaniments\n, as desired\nDirections\nIf Using the Presoaking Method:\nCombine water with cornmeal in a large mixing bowl and let stand, covered, at room temperature overnight. When ready to cook, scrape soaked cornmeal and water into a large saucier or saucepan and set over high heat. Continue with step 3.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIf Using the Standard Method:\nAdd water, milk, or stock to a large saucier or saucepan and set over high heat. Sprinkle in cornmeal while whisking (water does not have to be boiling).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBring to a boil, stirring frequently. Let boil, stirring frequently, until polenta thickens enough that it starts to spit. Lower heat immediately to prevent spitting and continue to cook, stirring frequently with a spoon or silicone spatula and scraping bottom to prevent scorching, until polenta becomes thick and pulls away from side of saucepan, about 30 minutes for presoaked cornmeal and 50 minutes for dry cornmeal. Season with salt.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nStir in butter or olive oil, using either a spoon, a silicone spatula, or a whisk. Polenta will become glossy from the added fat, and should feel rich, creamy, and smooth. If polenta forms lumps, beat vigorously with a stiff whisk to remove. If polenta becomes too firm or begins to set, add a small amount of water, stock, or milk and beat in with a whisk until liquid is fully incorporated and no lumps remain.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe right away with accompaniment of your choice, or continue with step 6 to sear or grill.\nTo Sear or Grill:\nGrease a rimmed quarter sheet pan with olive oil. Pour hot polenta into pan, then use a spatula to spread evenly. Place a sheet of parchment or plastic wrap against surface to further smooth and even surface. Wrap pan well in plastic, and refrigerate until completely chilled and set, at least 5 hours or up to overnight.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nUsing a thin spatula, loosen block of polenta. Invert onto a cutting board. Cut polenta into squares, rectangles, triangles, or circles, as you desire.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo sear, heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat. Coat bottom of skillet with oil, then, when shimmering, add polenta. Cook undisturbed until browned, crisp, and easily releases from skillet, about 3 minutes. Flip and repeat on second side. To grill, heat charcoal or gas grill over high heat.\nClean and oil grates\n. Add polenta and cook undisturbed until browned, crisp, and easily releases from grill, about 3 minutes. Flip and repeat on second side.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nServe topped with accompaniments of your choice (such as gorgonzola dolce).\nPolenta squares topped with gorgonzola dolce.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nSaucier\n,\nwhisk\n,\ncast iron skillet\nor\ngrill\n(optional)\nNotes\nAny medium- or coarse-ground cornmeal will work here, whether the package says \"polenta\" or not; avoid instant polenta, which promises a quick cooking time but delivers subpar flavor and texture. Cooking it in milk will produce a rich and creamy polenta that's delicious and indulgent, but also heavy; stock (vegetable or chicken) will infuse the polenta with more flavor, but that flavor can also cover up the taste of the cornmeal. Water produces the lightest polenta, with a mild corn flavor that pairs well with everything and won't leave you feeling weighed down after eating it.\nRead More\nCreamy Chocolate Polenta\nTurkey and Porcini Meatballs With Rosemary and Polenta\nPolenta Pasticciata (Polenta Lasagna With Mushroom Rag\u00f9\nItalian\nDairy-free Sides\nCornmeal\nRice & Grain Sides\nWinter Sides"
