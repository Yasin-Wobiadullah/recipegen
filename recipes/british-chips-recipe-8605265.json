Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until potatoes are fully tender, but not falling apart, about 12 minutes. Drain and spread into an even layer on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Let dry for 5 minutes. (For best results, freeze potatoes for at least 3 hours, until frozen solid, and up to overnight before continuing with step 2).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels; set aside. In a 6-quart Dutch oven or large wok, heat oil over high heat to 265\u00baF (130\u00baC). Add one-third of chips and cook, using a spider skimmer to agitate occasionally, until a crust begins to form, 3 minutes. Use spider skimmer to transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Return oil to 265\u00baF (130\u00baC) and repeat frying with the remaining potatoes, working in 2 more batches. Let potatoes cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. (For best results, transfer potatoes to a wire rack set within a rimmed baking sheet and freeze potatoes for at least 3 hours, until frozen solid, and up to overnight before continuing with step 3).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200\u00baF (90\u00baC). Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet; set aside. Reheat oil in Dutch oven over high heat to 400\u00baF (205\u00baC). Add half of the potatoes and fry until crisp and light golden brown, about 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a temperature of around 360\u00baF (180\u00baC). Transfer to a\u00a0 paper-towel lined bowl and season immediately with kosher salt and a dash of malt vinegar, if using and toss to combine. Transfer to prepared baking sheet and hold warm in the oven. Return oil to 400\u00baF (205\u00baC) and repeat frying and seasoning with the remaining chips. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n6-quart Dutch oven, pot, or wok, wire rack, rimmed baking sheet, instant read thermometer, spider\nPotatoes\nThe Latest\nBritish\nFried Potatoes"
