Then, take a small ice cream scoop and place four perfect balls of butter onto a small plate. Refrigerate for one hour.\nIf you want to make a steak like the one pictured, buy 4 half-pound bone-in sirloins, and trim some of the excess fat. Rub them all over with olive or vegetable oil, and season with salt and pepper. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Sear the steaks about 3 minutes on each side. Place a ball of beurre ma\u00eetre d' on each steak as it rests. I like to slice the steaks, and serve them with the warm butter dripping down around them.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Secret Ingredient (Parsley): Beurre Ma\u00eetre D'\nCondiments & Sauces\nParsley",
