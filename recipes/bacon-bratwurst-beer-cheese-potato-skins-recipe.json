  "full_text": "Bacon, Bratwurst, and Beer Cheese Potato Skins Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n80 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nCooling Time\n10 mins\nTotal\n100 mins\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n6\nslices\nbacon\n6\nmedium\nrusset potatoes\n, washed and scrubbed\n2\nteaspoons\ncanola or\nvegetable oil\n1\nmedium\nwhite onion\n, thinly sliced\nKosher salt\nand\nfreshly ground black pepper\n1\n(12-ounce) bottle\nbeer\n, divided (see note)\n1/2\npound\nbratwurst\n8\nounces\ngrated cheddar cheese\n(about\n2\ncups\n)\n2\nteaspoons\ncornstarch\n1\nteaspoon\ndijon mustard\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with foil and lay the bacon on top, making sure not to overlap. Bake until crisp, 14 to 18 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Set the cooked bacon aside on a paper towel lined plate and pour the rendered grease from the pan into a small bowl.\nPlace the potatoes on the same baking sheet and brush with about 2 tablespoons worth of bacon grease. Bake the potatoes until tender, about 40 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cook the onions\n: Heat 2 teaspoons canola oil oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low and cook until completely tender and browned, about 20 minutes. Add 2 tableppoons beer and cook, stirring, until mostly evaporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper and transfer onions to a small bowl. Cover with foil and set aside.\nCook the bratwurst:\nAdd bratwurst and another 1/4 cup beer to pan. Cover and cook over medium low heat, turning bratwurst occasionally, until nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove bratwurst from skillet, slice into thin disks, return to skillet, and continue cooking, covered, until cooked through. Keep warm until the potatoes are ready to be filled.\nMake the beer cheese:\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm 1 cup of beer until gently steaming and simmering. In a medium bowl, toss the grated cheddar cheese with the cornstarch and then add to the beer, one small handful at a time, stirring constantly. You want the cheese to melt and stir in entirely before adding the next handful. Continue until all of the cheese has been stirred in. Reduce heat to medium-low and mix in the dijon mustard. Keep warm until thickened and the potatoes are ready to be filled, stirring occasionally.\nWhen the potatoes are tender, remove them from the oven and allow to sit for a few minutes until they are cool enough to handle. Cut the potatoes in half, lengthwise. Scoop out the insides of the potatoes, leaving about 1/4-inch of the potato in the skins (reserve scooped out flesh for another use). Brush the outside and insides of the potatoes again with bacon grease. Place the potato skins skin-side-up on the baking sheet and sprinkle with salt. Return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes, then flip and bake until the edges begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer.\nRemove the potatoes from the oven and fill with beer cheese. Top with the caramelized onions and bratwurst slices. Crumble the reserved bacon and sprinkle on top. Serve immediately.\nAmerican\nBacon\nSausages\nRusset Potatoes\nComfort Food",
