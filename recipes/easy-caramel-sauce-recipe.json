  "full_text": "Easy Caramel Sauce Recipe\nJump to recipe\nCook\n15 mins\nActive\n20 mins\nTotal\n15 mins\nServes\n10 servings\nMakes\n1 1/3 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nounces\nwater\n(\n1/2\ncup\n;\n115\ng\n)\n8 1/2\nounces\nsugar\n(\n1 1/4\ncups\n;\n240\ng\n)\n1/2\nteaspoon\n(\n2\ng\n) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for\ntable salt\n, use half as much by volume or use the same weight\n1\nvanilla pod\n, reserved from another project (optional)\n8\nounces\nheavy cream\n(\n1\ncup\n;\n225\ng\n)\n1\nteaspoon\n(\n5\ng\n)\nvanilla extract\n(optional)\nDirections\nIn a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water, sugar, and salt over medium heat. If you like, add an empty vanilla pod, too. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 6 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is light to medium amber, a minute more. Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low.\nStirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula to knock back the foam, simmer until caramel registers 225\u00b0F (107\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a heat-resistant container, stir in vanilla extract (if using), and cool to room temperature. (No need to discard the vanilla bean; it will continue to infuse the caramel over time.) Caramel will be runny while warm, but thicken as it cools, turning just a little chewy when cold. Refrigerate up to 1 month in an airtight container.\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucier\n,\nheat-resistant spatula\n,\ndigital thermometer\nNotes\nWhen it comes time to add the cream, you won\u2019t have a second to spare, so be sure to have it scaled out and ready to go!\nDessert Sauces"
