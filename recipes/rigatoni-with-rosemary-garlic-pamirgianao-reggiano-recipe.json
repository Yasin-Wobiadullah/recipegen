Season to taste with salt and pepper and pulse until just combined, about 5 one-second pulses. Add 1 tablespoon of butter, and pulse until the butter is evenly distributed into the crumbs, about 5 more pulses. Place the mixture in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, and toast, stirring often, until the crumbs are golden brown, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cook the rigatoni according to package directions in a pot of salted water. Reserve 1 cup of cooking water before draining the pasta. Add the water back to the empty pasta pot, and bring to a simmer. Cube the remaining cold butter, and whisk it in a little at a time, to create a milky emulsion. Remove from heat and stir in the rigatoni. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into a serving bowl, and top with the breadcrumb mixture, extra Parmigiano Reggiano, and torn rosemary leaves.\nSpecial equipment\nFood processor\nPasta Mains\nQuick Dinners"
