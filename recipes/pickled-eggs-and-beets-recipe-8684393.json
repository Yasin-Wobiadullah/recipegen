Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves, 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer until brine deepens in color and reduces slightly, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon stick.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCarefully pour hot brine, along with pickling spices, over beets and eggs to cover completely. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nCover with a lid and refrigerate until eggs are sweet, tangy, and have a vivid purple hue, at least 3 days and up to 2 weeks. Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n1-quart heat-proof jar, medium saucepan\nNotes\nYou can make quick-pickled eggs in any lidded glass jar or heat-proof food storage container.\u00a0 You can also double, triple, or quadruple it\u2014my family makes big batches in large plastic food storage containers.\nThe amount of brine will vary depending on the size of your eggs, your chosen container, and how you've layered the ingredients. If you find yourself a bit short, top it off with the reserved pickled beet juice.\nBe careful when transferring your pickled eggs from jar to serving dish, as they will splatter. To prevent beet-stained hands, use a slotted spoon or wear food-grade gloves when handling beet-pickled eggs.\nIf using fresh beets, you\u2019ll need 3 to 4 medium beets (about 12 1/4 ounces; 350g). Trim the ends, then place the unpeeled beets in a large pot of water. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook beets until fork-tender, about 35 minutes. Using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, drain beets, reserving the liquid to use in lieu of the pickled beet juice. Rinse, peel, and slice the beets to 1/4-inch thickness before proceeding with the recipe as written. Refrigerate until beets and eggs are sweet and tangy, at least 7 days.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe eggs can be eaten after 24 hours, but will take on more color and flavor the longer they sit. For best results, allow eggs to pickle for at least 3 days.\nThis is a quick pickling recipe, and is not intended for canning or long-term preservation. Store pickled eggs in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\nEggs\nThe Latest\nVegetarian\nGluten-free\nPickling"
