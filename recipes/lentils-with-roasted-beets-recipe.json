Roast the beets until tender, about 1 hour.\nWhile the beets roast, rinse the lentils in cold water. Put the lentils in a medium pot with 3 cups water, onion, garlic cloves, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to low, and gently simmer until all the water has been absorbed and the lentils are tender, about 1 hour.\nAdd more water if you need to. Use a slotted spoon to fish out the onion, garlic, and bay leaf. Remove the beets from the oven, unwrap, and when cool enough to handle, slip off the skins. Dice the beets, then add them to the lentils. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish and drizzle generously with a really good extra-virgin olive oil, and garnish with lots of chopped parsley and scallions.\nDairy-free Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nRoasted Vegetables"
