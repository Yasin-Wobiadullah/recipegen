Beat, using the whisk attachment, electric beaters, or a whisk, until dry ingredients are evenly incorporated and cream forms soft peaks.\nCombine hot coffee, Frangelico, and simple syrup in a prewarmed mug. (You can prewarm it by pouring hot water into it, letting it stand for 1 minute, then draining.) Using a spoon, dollop whipped cream on top of coffee and top with a dusting of cocoa powder. Serve right away. (You may have more whipped cream than the mug can accommodate; feel free to add more as you drink, or use some for the next round.)\nNotes\nTo make a 2:1 simple syrup, combine 1/2 cup (120g) granulated sugar with 1/4 cup (60ml) water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring, until sugar is fully dissolved. In these recipes, you can add the syrup hot, since the drinks are hot; any extra can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three months, and often longer.\nRead More\nEverything Nice (Spiced-Rum Coffee With Butterscotch Whipped Cream)\nWake Me Up Before You Go-Go (Fernet-Spiked Irish Coffee With Lemon Cream)\nCoffee\nChocolate\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines\nWhiskey",
