Reserve the remaining stock.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Valantine\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch slurry with the eggs and a pinch of salt and white pepper.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Valantine\nUsing a paper towel, rub a thin film of oil into a wok and set it over high heat until smoking. Add the 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat. Add the ginger and let it sizzle for 10 seconds. Immediately add the scallion whites and garlic and stir-fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Valantine\nAdd the wine and cook, swirling as it sizzles, for a few seconds, then add the reserved chicken stock and peas. Stir the cornstarch slurry to redistribute, then stir it into the stock. Add the tofu and stir in very gently to avoid breaking it. Bring to a simmer, stirring gently, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 45 seconds. Adjust the seasoning to taste with salt, white pepper, and MSG (if using).\nSerious Eats / Andrew Valantine\nDrizzle the egg mixture into the sauce, then very slowly stir it with a ladle or wok spatula until the eggs form tender ribbons, about 30 seconds, being careful not to break the tofu pieces. Sprinkle with the reserved scallion greens and chopped cilantro (if using). Divide the mixture evenly over bowls of steamed rice and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Valantine\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nNotes\nIf you can\u2019t find firm silken tofu, soft tofu will work as well.\nQuick Dinners\nTofu\nThe Latest\nEggs\nThe Wok\nWhy The Wok?\nEssays & Profiles\nWok Recipes\nWok Skills 101\nWok Skills 102\nThe Wok Gear Guide\nThe Importance of the Wok\nQ&A: Grace Young & Her Woks\nFrom China: The Future of the Wok\nSan Francisco's Iconic Wok Shop\nExcerpt: The Science of Woks\nDim Sum\u2013Style Steamed Pork Ribs\nTofu With Peas and Silky Egg\nSichuan Stir-Fried Potatoes\nChinese Scrambled Eggs With Tomato\nTaiwanese Deep-Fried Squid Balls\nThai Chicken and Curry Stir-Fry\nJapanese Shrimp in Chili Sauce\nStir-Frying\nDeep-Frying\nBraising\nSteaming\nSmoking\nPassing-Through\nEssential Knife Skills for Wok Cooking\nSetting Up a Wok Cooking Station\nHow to Season Your Wok\nHacking Wok Hei at Home\nBest Flat-Bottomed Woks\nThe Best Torches for Wok Hei\nThe Full Wok Accessory Guide\nOutdoor Wok Burners Picks"
