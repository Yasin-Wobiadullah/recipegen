With a vegetable peeler, trim away the sharp edges of the fruit, leaving each piece with smooth, rounded edges.\nCombine apple slices, cider, candi or toasted sugar, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, ginger, lemon peel, and salt in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring from time to time, until apples are fork-tender, about 15 minutes. The exact timing can vary dramatically depending on the specifics of your stove, cooking vessel, and apple types, so pay more attention to the texture of the apples than to a specific timeline.\nTransfer fruit to a serving dish, along with enough syrup to keep apple slices moist and well-sauced. Return aromatics to remaining syrup. Enjoy compote warm or at room temperature.\nFor the Syrup:\nReturn syrup to a simmer and cook until reduced by one-third, about 5 minutes. Transfer syrup and aromatics to an airtight jar; use like simple syrup in your favorite cocktails and desserts.\nSpecial equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\nNotes\nThis recipe works best with the caramel notes of Belgian candi sugar or darkly\ntoasted sugar\n, but if you'd prefer the tangy flavor of molasses, an equal amount of brown sugar or turbinado can be used instead.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nApple Compote Is an Elegant Topping (and Delicious on Its Own)\nCondiments & Sauces\nStovetop\nApple"
