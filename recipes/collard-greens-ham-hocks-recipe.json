Cover and cook at a bare simmer until hocks are very tender, 2 to 3 hours.\nRemove ham hocks from liquid, transfer to a cutting board, and pull bones from meaty and fatty parts. Discard bones. Chop up meat into chunks and return it to pot.\nAdd collard greens, pressing down to submerge in liquid. Return to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until collards are very tender, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add vinegar to taste, if desired, then serve. (You can add vinegar to the pot, or let individual diners season their greens with it at the table.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\nNotes\nYou can swap out the ham hocks for other smoked or cured pork products, like slab bacon or salt pork, as long as they aren't lean meats, like smoked pork loin. Lean meat will dry up and toughen with extended cooking.\nCollard Greens\nSoul Food & Southern\nVegetable Sides"
