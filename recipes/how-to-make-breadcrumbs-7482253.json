  "full_text": "How to Make Bread Crumbs\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n30 mins\nCooling Time\n5 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8\nounces\n(\n225\ng\n)\nbread\nKosher salt\nDirections\nIf desired, trim crust from bread; basic white sandwich bread with soft, light crusts generally won't require it, but you may want to remove the dark crusts from more rustic deeply baked loaves, depending on how you plan to use the bread crumbs (see headnote above for more). Cut bread into 3/4- to 1-inch pieces.\nIf using fresh or lightly stale bread, adjust oven rack to middle position, and preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C). (If using fully stale and dried bread, skip baking step.) Arrange bread in single layer on rimmed baking sheet, and bake until completely dried, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and allow to cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer bread to food processor bowl and pulse until reduced to small crumbs, taking care not to over-process into a fine powder, 8 to 10 pulses (exact number of pulses can vary quite a bit depending on the food process, bread type, and other factors). Add salt to taste. Store bread crumbs until ready to use.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nUntoasted, the bread crumbs can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 months. Adding fresh seasonings like parsley and lemon zest will shorten the lifespan of bread crumbs to about 2 weeks.\nNo-Cook\nThe Latest\nBread"
