  "full_text": "Perfectly Tender Sous Vide Octopus Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n5 hrs 15 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nTotal\n5 hrs 25 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\n(\n2 1/2-pound; 1 kg\n)\nwhole octopus\n, rinsed well (including inside head cavity); see note\nDirections\nPreheat a sous vide cooker to 175\u00b0F (79\u00b0C). If you want to guarantee a good shape for the octopus tentacles (this is optional, but visually nice), bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Using tongs, dip the octopus into the water just until the tentacles hold a more rigid and graceful curl, not more than 30 seconds. Drain.\nIf necessary, using a sharp knife or good kitchen shears, divide the octopus into manageable portions that can be bagged more easily (small octopuses can be kept whole). You can choose how to do this: separate the tentacles individually, or keep them in clusters of 2 or 4. If you do decide to break down the octopus, remove the hard beak that sits at the point where the tentacles converge in the body, as well as the small eyes just below the pouch-like head. Make sure to bag and cook the head pouch as well; it's not as delicious as the tentacles, but it's still good.\nPlace octopus pieces in zipper-lock or vacuum bags and seal using the vacuum sealer or the\ndisplacement method\n.\nSubmerge in water and cook for 5 hours. Remove bags, chill rapidly in an ice-water bath, then refrigerate until ready to use. (Chilling helps set the skin so it doesn't fall off later, so it's good to do even if you're planning to serve the octopus warm.)\nTo Serve Cold:\nCut tentacles and head into pieces and add to a seafood salad or ceviche.\nTo Sear:\nHeat a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add octopus pieces and cook until well browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Turn and brown on other side, about 3 minutes longer. Season with salt and serve as desired.\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion circulator\n, zipper-lock or\nvacuum sealer\nand bags\nNotes\nWhile this recipe calls for a specific size of octopus, it truly works for octopus of any size; the only limitation is how much you can fit in your immersion circulator.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe chilled octopus can be refrigerated in the bags for up to 3 days.\nRead More\nThe Best Ways to Cook Octopus\nClassic Pulpo Gallego (Galician Octopus Tapa)\nOctopus Poke With Kimchi\nSous Vide Cooking: How to Get Started\nSous Vide Seafood\nOctopus\nSeafood Mains",
