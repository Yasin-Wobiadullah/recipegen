  "full_text": "The Ultimate Lobster, Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado, and Tomato Sandwiches Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n60 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nCooling Time\n15 mins\nTotal\n95 mins\nServes\n2 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nripe\ntomatoes\n2\nsmall\nlobsters\n(about\n1 pound\neach)\n2 to 3\ntablespoons\nfool-proof homemade\nmayonnaise\n2\nteaspoons\nfresh juice\nfrom\n1\nwhole\nlemon\n2\ntablespoons\nfinely sliced\nchives\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n1\npound\nthick cut bacon\n2\nsmall loaves\nciabatta\n, split in half horizontally\n1\navocado\n, thinly sliced\n4\niceberg lettuce leaves\n, crisp white/pale yellow parts only\nDirections\nFor the Tomatoes:\nBring a large pot of water that can fit a steamer attachment to a boil. Cut a small X in the bottom of each tomato. Place tomatoes in water and cook for 30 seconds, then immediately transfer to a bowl of cold water. Set aside. Pour off all but 1 inch of water from Dutch oven and add steamer insert. Cover and keep hot.\nFor the Lobster:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Meanwhile, kill each lobster by pressing the tip of a heavy chef's knife in the crack just behind the eyes in the center of the carapace. Press down firmly, then split head in half. Using kitchen towels, twist off tail and claws (including knuckles) from carapace. Save carapace for another use.\nPlace lobster claws and tails in steamer insert. Cover and steam for exactly 2 minutes, then transfer lobster to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet (lobsters may still be twitching slightly\u2014this is a reflex reaction. Don't worry, they are dead). Repeat with remaining lobster. Transfer to oven and roast until claws reach 135\u00b0F in the center as measured on an instant-read thermometer, about 7 minutes. Remove claws and set aside on large plate. Continue roasting until tails reach 135\u00b0F in center, 7 to 15 minutes longer (depending on exact shape of tails). Remove from oven and transfer to a bowl of cold water.\nWhen cold, shuck lobster meat. Roughly chop, drain on paper towels, then transfer to a large bowl. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons mayonnaise (to taste), lemon juice, and chives. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep lobster salad refrigerated until ready to use.\nFor the Bacon:\nLay bacon slices on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, allowing each slice to overlap slight lengthwise to form a solid sheet of bacon. Transfer to oven and cook until crisp, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Preheat broiler to high.\nWhile bacon cooks, peel tomatoes (the skins should slip off). Split each tomato into quarter, then using a sharp chef's knife, remove the inner flesh and seeds to form 8 tomato filets. Set aside.\nTransfer bacon sheet to a cutting board, reserving fat separate. Cut bacon sheet into large pieces that just fit the bread. Set aside.\nSpread cut surface of each piece of bread with 1 teaspoon rendered bacon fat. Broil cut-side-up until well-browned.\nTo Assemble:\nSpread mayonnaise to taste on each bottom bread half. Arrange avocado slices on top. Arrange bacon sheet on top of avocado. Add tomato filets. Spread mayonnaise to taste on the top of each bread half. Add lettuce leaves. Press lobster salad into lettuce leaves, compressing bread slightly. Close sandwiches. Cut in half, and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nPot with steamer insert, baking sheet\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: How To Make Lobster, Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado, and Tomato Sandwiches\nSandwiches\nLobster",
