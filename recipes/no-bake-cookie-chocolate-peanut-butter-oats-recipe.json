Bring to a boil over medium heat (this should take about 5 minutes), then clip-on a digital thermometer and continue cooking until mixture is bubbly, thick, and exactly 230\u00b0F (110\u00b0C), about 6 minutes longer. For best results, avoid handheld thermometers, which may not perform well due to unsteady placement during long-term projects such as candy.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nOff heat, whisk in melted chocolate, peanut butter, and vanilla extract. Using a flexible, heat-resistant spatula, fold in both types of oats. Stir just until mixture begins to thicken, then drop onto a parchment-lined half sheet pan, using a pair of metal spoons. Cool until cookies are firm and dry to the touch, about 25 minutes, and transfer to an airtight container. Store about 2 weeks at room temperature or up to 1 month in the fridge.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart stainless steel saucier\n,\nwhisk\n,\nclip-on digital thermometer\n,\nheat-safe flexible spatula\n,\nhalf sheet pan\nNotes\nI love these cookies best with a blend of instant and old-fashioned oats, but it's fine to use just one or the other. Instant oats will produce a more homogeneous, cookie-like texture, while rolled oats will give them a heartier chew. You'll still be using a total of 3 ounces (85g) either way, but the volume will differ. For instant oats, use about 3/4 cup; for old-fashioned rolled oats (not thick-cut), use about 1 cup.\nRead More\nNo-Bake Super-Chewy Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Oat Bars\nNo-Bake Crispy Corn Flake Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars\nCookies\nNo-Cook Desserts\nChocolate\nPeanut Butter\nOats"
