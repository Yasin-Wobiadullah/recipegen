Stirring constantly, add cornstarch and stir until dissolved. Set sauce aside. Drain eggplant carefully and pat dry with paper towels.\nHeat oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Reduce heat to medium, add eggplant, and cook, tossing occasionally, until softened and well browned on all sides. Push to sides of wok. Return wok to high heat and add ginger, garlic, and scallions. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until fragrant and raw bite is gone, about 30 seconds. Add broad bean paste and cook, stirring for about 30 seconds. Pour in chile sauce, making sure to scrape in any sugar or starch that may have settled on the bottom.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nCook, tossing constantly, until sauce is thickened, glossy, and coats eggplants nicely, 1 to 3 minutes (if the sauce overthickens, thin with a few tablespoons of water). Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with chopped fresh cilantro leaves, and serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nRead More\nFish-Fragrant Eggplants (Sichuan Braised Eggplant with Garlic, Ginger, and Chiles)\nBraised Eggplant With Tofu in Garlic Sauce\nBraised Eggplant With Pork in Sichuan Sauce\nChinese\nDairy-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nBraised & Stewed Vegetables",
