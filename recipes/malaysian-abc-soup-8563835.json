Pour in enough water to cover the ingredients by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook, adding water as needed to keep ingredients covered, until chicken is cooked through and very tender and broth has developed a rich chicken flavor, about 2 hours. (If desired, you can cook the soup even longer\u2014up to 2 more hours\u2014for an even deeper flavor.)\nSerious Eats / Michelle Yip\nTo serve, remove any chicken bones or carcass, if using, along with the celery, then season to taste with salt or soy sauce. Serve with the meaty bone-in chicken pieces left whole (or pick the meat and discard those bones, if desired, though this isn't typically done in Malaysia).\nSpecial Equipment\n6- to 8-quart soup pot\nNotes\nChinese celery can be found at Asian grocery stores; if you can\u2019t find it, substitute with cilantro or scallions.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup can be kept refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. We do not recommend freezing, as the potatoes break apart when the soup is defrosted.\nMalaysian\nThe Latest\nSoutheast Asian\nChicken\nSoups",
