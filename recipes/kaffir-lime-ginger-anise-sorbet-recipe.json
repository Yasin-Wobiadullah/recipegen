  "full_text": "Scooped: Kaffir Lime, Ginger, Star Anise Sorbet Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nChurning/Freezing Time\n5 hrs 30 mins\nTotal\n6 hrs\nServes\n6\nto 8 servings\nMakes\n1 quart\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3 1/2\ncups\ncoconut water\n(not coconut milk)\n12\nmakrut lime leaves\n, slightly bruised in your palm\n2\nsmall pieces\nstar anise\n1\ntablespoon\nginger\n, shredded on a fine grater or microplane\n2 to 3\ntablespoons\nlime juice\n, to taste\n1\ncup\nsugar\nDirections\nPut the coconut water, makrut lime leaves, and a tiny pinch of salt in a saucepan and bring to a bare simmer over medium heat, uncovered. Take your time with this and start with cold ingredients\u2014more aromatic flavors will be extracted that way.\nWhen the pot is just bubbling and the leaves have faded to a dull olive green, take the pot off the heat and remove them. Stir in the sugar till dissolved and add the star anise.\nLet the anise steep in the pot for ten to twenty minutes. The timing here isn't critical and is largely based on how much anise flavor you want in the final product.\nTransfer the pot to an ice water bath. To cool it down especially fast, run a thin stream of cold water through the bath and put an ice pack in the pot. If you're using a freezer bowl style of ice cream maker, you may want to chill the mixture further in the refrigerator to ensure that it'll churn properly.\nWhen chilled, stir in the ginger and two tablespoons of lime juice. Give it a taste; if you want a little more tartness, add the last tablespoon of juice. Otherwise transfer it straight to your machine and freeze according to your manufacturer's instructions.\nThe sorbet's texture improves after an hour or two in the fridge. Some potential toppings: lime zest, grass jelly cubes, or tapioca pearls.\nSpecial Equipment\nIce cream maker\nSorbets\nDairy-free Desserts\nVegan Desserts",
