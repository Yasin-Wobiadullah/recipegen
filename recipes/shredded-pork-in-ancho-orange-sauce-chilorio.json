Pour in the chile puree, bring to a simmer, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often, until thickened and darkened. Toss in the shredded meat and juices and cook until the meat has absorbed most of the chile sauce, 20 to 25 minutes. Taste for salt.\nServe the meat rolled up in the warm flour tortillas or with the tortillas on the side.\nPork Mains\nMexican\nBraised & Stewed Pork\nPork Shoulder"
