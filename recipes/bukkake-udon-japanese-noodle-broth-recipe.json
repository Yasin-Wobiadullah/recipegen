Cook, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Transfer to a bowl and set in the refrigerator to chill. (You can also rapidly cool by pouring mixture into a stainless steel mixing bowl and nesting that bowl in a slightly larger mixing bowl filled with ice water.)\nCombine 1/4 cup of the soy/mirin mixture (kaeshi) with dashi and stir. Taste mixture and add remaining kaeshi if desired. Keep chilled.\nIn a medium pot of boiling water, cook udon until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes (or follow cooking time on package if it differs). Transfer to an ice bath to chill. Drain noodles well.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer noodles to 2 soup bowls. Top with garnishes and condiments of your choice, then pour dashi broth into each bowl and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nFor the broth, you can use an equal quantity of instant dashi in place of the from-scratch dashi here, with excellent results. Feel free to play with the ratio of soy-mirin concentrate to dashi, using more dashi for a lighter, less salty broth or less dashi for a more intense flavor.\nRead More\nCold Somen Noodles with Dipping Sauce Recipe\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Shopping for Asian Noodles\nNo-Cook Recipes for Summer\nNoodle Mains\nJapanese\nStovetop Noodles\nNoodles\nSoups",
