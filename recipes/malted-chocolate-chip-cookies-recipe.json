Combine sugar, butter, malted milk powder, barley malt syrup, vanilla extract, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, increase to medium, and beat until soft and light, about 5 minutes. Add egg and continue beating until smooth, about 2 minutes more, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula as needed. Resume mixing on low, add flour, and, when fully incorporated, add pecan pieces and chopped chocolate.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWith a pair of spoons, divide into about forty 1 1/4-ounce portions and arrange on half sheet pans, leaving about 2 inches in between each, as the cookies will spread significantly in the oven. Bake until puffed and pale gold around the edges, but still soft and pale in the middle, about 15 minutes. Cool directly on the sheet pan until firm, about 10 minutes. Enjoy warm, or allow to cool completely then store in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature.\nIf you like, portioned dough can be divided between several heavy duty zip-top bags and refrigerated up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), and bake as directed.\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\nwith paddle attachment\nNotes\nLook for barley malt syrup in the baking aisle of major supermarkets, or shop online. Malted milk powder from brands like Carnation and Ovaltine is found in the hot cocoa aisle, or you can buy it in bulk; my favorite brand is Hoosier Hill Farm.\nRead More\nMeet the Umami Bomb of Dessert: Malted Milk Powder\nDessert Recipes Starring Malted Milk Powder\nThe Real Differences Between Brown and White Sugars\nHow Does Baking Powder Affect My Cookies?\nSoft and Chewy Sugar Cookies Recipe\nCookies\nBaking\nChocolate\nPecans\nMother's Day"
