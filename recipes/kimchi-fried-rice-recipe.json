Stir well until both are incorporated.\nAdd the rice, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Stir until it is evenly mixed in with the kimchi. Pour the sesame oil on top of this mixture. Spread the rice and kimchi out as much as possible in an even layer, and let cook for a few minutes until it gets a little crispy on the bottom. Turn off the heat, and divide the mixture between four bowls.\nPour the remaining one tablespoon of oil into a nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat. When shimmering, crack in the eggs, cover the skillet, and cook until the whites have set. When each is done, use a spatula and set one egg on top of each bowl of rice.
