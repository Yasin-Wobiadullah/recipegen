Add vanilla and beat just until combined.\nTransfer mixture to a pastry bag or large zipper-lock bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star or plain pastry tip. Pipe meringue in a circular motion, pressing tip into meringue as it pipes out, into prepared tin, mounding meringue about 1-inch above edge.\nBake cupcakes until firm and dry, about 1 1/2 hours, then, shut oven off and prop door open.
