  "full_text": "The Simplest White Bread Ever Recipe | Bread Baking\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n40 mins\nProof\n10 hrs 10 mins\nTotal\n11 hrs\nServes\n10 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ntablespoon\nwhite sugar\n2 1/2\nteaspoons\n(\n1\npackage\n)\nyeast\n1\ncup\nlukewarm\nwater\n2 1/2\ncups\n(\n11 1/4\noz\n)\nall-purpose flour\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n2\ntablespoons\nolive oil\nDirections\nAdd the sugar and yeast to the water in your measuring cup and stir to combine. If you're using anything except and instant yeast, let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture is lively and bubbly. If it's instant yeast, you can continue without proofing, or let it proof to ease your mind that the yeast is alive\u2014your choice.\nPut the flour and salt into a medium bowl, and stir to distribute salt.\nAdd the water/yeast mixture to the the bowl with the flour, and stir to combine all the ingredients.\nSprinkle some flour on your countertop and dump the dough mixture onto the counter. Knead for a minute or two, adding flour as necessary to keep it from sticking. You don't need to knead until the dough is stretchy and elastic - just knead until it's a nice cohesive mixture and not a lumpy, sticky, blobby mess. Form it into a ball.\nDrizzle the olive oil into a zip-top bag and plop the dough into the bag. Make sure the dough is completely coated with olive oil, zip the top, and stash it in the refrigerator overnight.\nThe next day, take the bag out of the fridge and massage it a bit, still in the bag, to mash out all the bubbles in the dough. You may need to open the bag to let the air out, but reseal it after.\nLeave the bag on the countertop until the dough has come to room temperature, about an hour. It will rise and expand a bit during that time.\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Sprinkle some cornmeal on the bottom of a loaf pan.\nSprinkle some flour on your counter top, and dump the dough onto the counter. You don't need to squeeze every bit of olive oil out of the bag, but don't try to hold it back, either.\nKnead and fold it a bit to incorporate the olive oil into the dough, then form the dough into a log that will fit into your loaf pan.\nPut the loaf into the pan, cover the pan with plastic wrap, and let it rise until it has at least doubled in size. I used an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2 pan and let it rise until it was slightly higher than the pan.\nRemove the plastic wrap, slash the top, and bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes, until the bread is golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.\nLet it cool completely on a rack before slicing.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSerious Entertaining: A Real Deal Barbecue Feast\nYeast Breads"
