  "full_text": "No-Churn Vanilla Ice Cream Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n5 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nFreezing Time\n6 hrs\nTotal\n6 hrs 20 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nMakes\n1 quart\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n6\nounces\nheavy cream\n(about\n3/4\ncup\n;\n170\ng\n)\n3\nlarge\neggs\n(about\n5 1/2\nounces\n;\n155\ng\n)\n3 1/2\nounces\nsugar\n(about\n1/2\ncup\n;\n100\ng\n)\n1/4\nteaspoon\n(\n1\ng\n) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for\ntable salt\n, use about half as much by volume or the same weight\n3/4\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\nDirections\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cream until thick enough to hold stiff peaks; the time will vary depending on the power of a given mixer, so keep a close eye on the process. Transfer to a large, non-reactive container (this will be used to hold the ice cream later on), then cover and refrigerate until needed. Rinse the bowl and whisk, then wipe dry before re-using in step 2.\nFill a large pot or Dutch oven with a few inches of water; bring to a boil, then lower heat to maintain a simmer, and a steady supply of steam. Place eggs, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer, and stir with a flexible spatula to combine. Set bowl over the steaming pot, using a crumpled strip of foil formed into a ring to act as a booster seat so that the bowl does not touch the bottom of the pot. Cook, stirring and scraping constantly, until warmed to 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C), about 5 minutes. This should not take significantly longer; major delays simply indicate insufficient heat/lack of steam.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, and add the vanilla extract. Whip on high speed until the mixture is foamy, more than quadrupled in size, and thick enough to briefly mound up like soft-serve ice cream when dropped from the whisk, between 5 to 8 minutes depending on the horsepower of the mixer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFold in the prepared whipped cream, working gently to incorporate it as thoroughly as possible without deflating or overmixing the base. Scrape into the now-chilled container, cover, and freeze until firm enough to scoop\u2014approximately 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C). The time required will vary depending on the size and material of the container, but expect 6 to 8 hours. Once cold, scoop like ice cream and serve in chilled dishes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nStand mixer\n,\ndigital thermometer\nNotes\nIf you've had trouble foaming eggs in the past, your stand mixer's\nbowl-to-beater clearance may need adjusting\n.\nRead More\nScotch Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\nNo-Churn Mascarpone Ice Cream\nNo-Churn Chocolate Ice Cream\nNo-Churn Vanilla Ice Cream Pie\nFruity No-Churn Ice Cream\nIce Cream\nSummer Desserts",
