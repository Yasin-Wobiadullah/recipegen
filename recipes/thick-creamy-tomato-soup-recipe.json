  "full_text": "Thick and Creamy Tomato Soup\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n110 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nTotal\n110 mins\nServes\n8\nto 12 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nounces\nunsalted butter\n(\n1\nstick\n;\n114\ng\n)\n4\nlarge\ncarrots\n(\n1\npound\n;\n455\ng\n), diced (see notes)\n2\nmedium\nyellow onions\n(\n1\npound\n;\n455\ng\n), diced (see notes)\n3\nlarge (\n28-ounce\n;\n795\ng\n)\ncans\nwhole tomatoes\n, crushed roughly by hand\n4\ncups\n(\n950\nml\n)\nhomemade\nor store-bought\nlow-sodium chicken stock\n1/4\nteaspoon\nbaking soda\n, plus more as needed (optional)\n8\nounces\nheavy cream\n(\n1\ncup\n;\n225\ng\n)\nUp to\n1 1/4\nteaspoons\n(\n5\ng\n) Diamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n1/2\nteaspoon\n(\n1\ng\n)\nfreshly ground black pepper\n, or more to taste\n1/8\nteaspoon\nground cayenne\n, or more to taste\n1/2\nounce\nfresh basil leaves\n(\n1\nloosely packed cup\n;\n15\ng\n), cut into\nchiffonade\nDirections\nIn a 6-quart stainless steel pot, melt butter over medium heat until foaming, then add carrots and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally until butter starts to brown on the bottom, about 15 minutes. Add tomatoes, followed by chicken stock. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until quite thick, about 1 1/2 hours; adjust heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTaste broth; if its flavor is too sharp or acidic, add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and stir well (it will foam at first). Taste and repeat if needed. Pur\u00e9e soup with an immersion blender until smooth, or cool until no longer steaming before pur\u00e9eing in a countertop blender. Stir in cream, then season with salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste. Rewarm to serve. Stir in basil just before serving. In a sealed nonreactive container, tomato soup will keep up to 1 week in the refrigerator or 6 months in the freezer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge stainless steel pot,\nimmersion blender\nor\ncountertop blender\nNotes\nThe size of a \"medium\" onion or a \"large\" carrot is inherently subjective, so the specifics of the vegetables listed above are meant as a guide rather than some draconian rule. The recipe itself works quite well give or take a few ounces either way.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nIn a sealed nonreactive container, tomato soup will keep up to one week in the refrigerator, or six months in the freezer.\nSoups\nHeavy Cream\nCarrots\nTomato\nWinter Mains"
