Place batched mix in the freezer until freezer-cold, about 8 hours.\nWhen ready to serve, pour mix into blender and add 8 ice cubes or 160 grams crushed ice. Pulse blender 5 times, then blend until uniform. Taste and add up to 1/4 ounce additional lime juice or turbinado simple syrup as needed. Blend once more briefly and serve immediately, with a straw if desired.\nIf you want to make multiple drinks, you can pre-batch up to a double recipe (a blender may not hold much more than that easily) in a single container, add 14 ice cubes, then divide after blending; if making more than two drinks, use separate containers to hold more servings.\nSpecial equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nTo make turbinado simple syrup, combine equal volumes of turbinado sugar, such as Sugar in the Raw, and hot water in a tight-fitting resealable container such as a mason jar. Shake vigorously until sugar is completely dissolved; extra simple syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 month.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make the Best Frozen Daiquiris\nRum",
