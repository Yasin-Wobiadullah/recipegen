Remove the shoots from the heads and, if present, trim and discard the woody bottom end of each. Cut shoots into 1/4-inch-thick strips (you may need to halve or quarter them lengthwise first). If there\u2019s a fatter core, trim off the tougher base, cut it in half lengthwise, and then cut the halves into strips.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nAlternatively, if using endive, quarter endive lengthwise without removing cores. Slice each quarter into 1/8-inch strips lengthwise, at an angle through core, so leaves remain attached.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nTransfer prepared puntarelle or endive to a bowl and cover fully with cold water and a handful of ice cubes. Cover with a small plate or other similar object to keep pieces submerged. Refrigerate until curled, at least 2 hours (they may remain submerged for up to 18 hours).\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nDrain puntarelle or endive and dry in a salad spinner. Refrigerate until needed.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, place anchovies, garlic, and salt on a cutting board and mash with the back of a fork until a coarse paste forms. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add vinegar and whisk until uniform. Add oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until emulsified.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nAdd puntarelle or endive, parsley, and half of the capers to bowl and toss to coat with dressing. Season with pepper and salt to taste. Transfer to a serving platter, top with remaining capers, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nSpecial Equipment\nsalad spinner\nNotes\nSome supermarkets sell heads of red endive, which is actually a cross between endive and treviso. (Trader Joe\u2019s sells them in mixed packs.) Use a mix of both if you can find them for a splash of color.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce soaked, drained, and spun dry, endive or puntarelle will keep for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.\nItalian\nThe Latest\nGreens\nGreen Salads"
