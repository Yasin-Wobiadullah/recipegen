Add water, sugar, and black peppercorns, stirring to dissolve sugar. Simmer for 15 minutes, strain, and let cool before using.\nFor the Cocktails:\nAdd pineapple juice, orgeat, lime juice, Cumin-Pepper Syrup, gin, and cayenne to a cocktail shaker and add one large and two standard ice cubes (or fill 2/3 full with standard ice cubes). Shake until well chilled and frothy, about 30 seconds. Strain into two cocktail glasses and serve immediately.\nNotes\nTo make pineapple juice from scratch without a juicer, muddle or blend 3/4 cup of cubed peeled fresh pineapple, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer. This cocktail was designed using Calyx Gin, which is dry, crisp, and loaded with spice and grapefruit. If you can't find the Calyx, choose a bold, juniper-heavy London Dry, not a softer, New Western\u2013style gin.\nSpecial Equipment\nMuddler or juicer, cocktail shaker and strainer, fine-mesh strainer (if using muddler)\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThis Savory Pineapple Cocktail Is a Vacation in a Glass\nGin\nPineapple",
