Add pork and cook, stirring vigorously with a large spoon to break up any large clumps, until meat turns gray and is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow pork to cool for 30 seconds.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd fish sauce, lime juice, sugar (if using), and 1 1/2 teaspoons (7g) ground chile. Stir to combine and then allow to cool for 5 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd shallot, culantro (if using), cilantro, and scallions, and stir to combine. At this point, make sure you have everything ready to go that you plan to serve with the laab, such as sticky rice. Once you are ready to serve, add khao khua and stir until thoroughly combined and most of the liquid in the saucepan has been absorbed, 10 to 15 seconds. Add mint and stir gently until just combined. Taste and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce, ground chiles, and/or lime juice as needed. The salad should be assertive\u2014acidic, salty, and spicy\u2014but balanced. Serve immediately with cooked sticky rice.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucier\nNotes\nIf your butcher counter takes requests, coarsely ground pork shoulder (sometimes referred to as a \u201cbutcher\u2019s grind\u201d) is ideal for laab as it most closely approximates the texture of hand-minced meat used in traditional laab. Regular ground pork will work for this recipe as well, but the texture will be more pebbly. Pork shoulder has great flavor and its high fat content helps balance the punch of the dressing.\nCulantro\n, also known as sawtooth coriander, is a common addition to laab moo Isan. It adds a peppery and slightly bitter herbal note to the dish. Culantro can be found in Southeast Asian, Central American, and Caribbean markets. If you cannot find culantro, double the amount of cilantro in the recipe.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately.\nThai\nQuick Salads\nThe Latest\nStovetop Pork",
