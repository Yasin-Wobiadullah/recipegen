Place sweet potato in an oven-safe vessel (such as a cast iron pan or a small baking dish) and roast until a knife or skewer inserted into its center meets no resistance, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Roasted sweet potato can be wrapped and stored in refrigerator for several days before you continue with the recipe.\nPeel and discard sweet potato skin and mash flesh with a fork in a medium bowl. Add cilantro, pickled jalape\u00f1os, and scallions (see notes). Stir and fold to combine. Season to taste with salt.\nSpread about 1/2 cup of the mixture evenly over half of 1 tortilla, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Fold tortilla over and seal edges by pressing down firmly. Repeat with remaining filling and as many tortillas as needed (about 4 to 6, depending on the exact size of the sweet potato).\nHeat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil in a large skillet or on a griddle over medium heat until shimmering. Carefully add 2 folded tortillas and cook, swirling and moving tortillas around, until golden brown and puffy on first side, about 2 minutes. Using a flexible metal spatula, flip quesadillas, season with salt, and continue cooking until golden brown and puffy on second side, about 2 minutes longer.\nTransfer quesadillas to a paper towel to drain and repeat step 4 to cook remaining quesadillas. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge skillet\nor\ngriddle\n,\nflexible metal spatula\nNotes\nYou can replace the cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, and scallions with any of your favorite quesadilla fillings, or use\none of our suggested combinations here\n, replacing the cheese with mashed sweet potato.\nRead More\nCorn and Zucchini Quesadillas\nSpinach, Black Bean, and Chipotle Quesadillas\nSpicy Chicken Quesadillas\nQuick Dinners\nMexican\nStovetop\nSweet Potatoes\nQuick Snacks"
