Line a baking sheet with heavy duty aluminum foil.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nPlace pecans on prepared baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Keep a close eye on them, as they can burn fast. Transfer nuts to cutting board and chop coarsely. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nIncrease oven temperature to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C). Lay the bacon strips out flat on the same foil-lined baking sheet, leaving space in between so they don't overlap. Roast until bacon is crisp, 12 to 20 minutes, rotating half way through the cooking time (cooking time will depend on thickness of bacon). Transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper towels; pour rendered bacon fat into a small dish and discard aluminum foil. When bacon is cool, finely chop.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nIncrease oven temperature to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Line baking sheet with fresh aluminum foil. Toss Brussels sprouts with rendered bacon fat, olive oil, salt, and pepper, directly on baking sheet. Roast, stirring midway through to promote even browning, until Brussels sprouts are tender and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Add balsamic vinegar and maple syrup and toss to coat evenly. Taste and adjust seasoning then transfer to serving dish. Right before serving, top with chopped pecans and bacon. Serve hot or at room temperature.\nSerious Eats / Mateja Zvirotic Andrijanic\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n, aluminum foil\nRead More\nHow to Trim and Cut Brussels Sprouts\nSeared Brussels Sprouts With Bacon Recipe\nWarm Brussels Sprout Salad With Bacon and Hazelnut Vinaigrette Recipe\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts and Shallots with Balsamic Vinegar Recipe\nRoasted Vegetables\nBacon\nBrussels Sprouts\nFall Sides\nThanksgiving Side Dishes",
