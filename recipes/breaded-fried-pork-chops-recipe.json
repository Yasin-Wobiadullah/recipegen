Set 3 wide, shallow bowls on a work surface. Add flour to the first one; beaten eggs to the second; and panko, Parmesan cheese, and sage to the third. Season panko and Parmesan with kosher salt and pepper and mix thoroughly.\nWorking with one chop at a time, dredge a pork chop in flour with your left hand, shaking off excess. Transfer to egg dish, then turn pork with your right hand to coat both sides. Lift with your right hand and allow excess egg to drip off, then transfer to bread crumb mixture. With your left hand, scoop bread crumbs on top of pork, then gently press, turning pork to ensure a good layer of crumbs on both sides. Transfer pork to a clean parchment-lined baking sheet with your left hand and repeat with remaining cutlets.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFill a large cast iron skillet or straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan with 1/4 inch oil or clarified butter. (To speed things up even more, use 2 skillets simultaneously.) Heat cooking fat over high heat until shimmering and just shy of smoking. A bread crumb dropped in it should sizzle and foam immediately.\nWorking in batches,\u00a0 gently lower chops into hot fat using tongs or your fingers, laying them down away from you to prevent hot fat from splashing toward you.\u00a0 Fry, gently swirling pan and rotating chops for even browning, and adjusting heat as necessary for a steady, vigorous bubble, until bottom sides are browned and crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip chops and fry until other sides are browned and crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer to paper towel-lined baking sheet\u00a0 to drain and season lightly with salt right away. Repeat with remaining chops. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\ncast iron skillet\nor straight-sided\nsaut\u00e9 pan\nNotes\nClarified butter will give the fried chops the best possible flavor, but it requires more work and tends to be more expensive; oil is absolutely fine as a time- and cost-saving ingredient.
