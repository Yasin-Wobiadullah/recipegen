Set skillet over medium heat and allow to preheat for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, gently form each portion of ground beef into a cylindrical puck about 2 inches tall, pressing together just until meat holds its shape without falling apart. Season generously on all sides with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nIncrease heat under skillet to high and heat until skillet is smoking. Add 2 beef pucks to skillet and, using a firm, stiff metal spatula, press down on each one until they're roughly 4 to 4 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick (see note). It helps to use a second spatula to apply downward pressure to the first if you are having trouble smashing them hard enough.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nCook without moving until a golden brown crust develops, about 1 1/2 minutes. Use the edge of the spatula to carefully scrape up and flip the patties one at a time, making sure to get all browned bits removed from the skillet. If using cheese, add now.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nContinue to cook until patties are cooked to desired doneness\u2014about 30 seconds longer for medium-rare. Transfer patties to toasted buns, topping buns and/or patties as desired, close burgers, and serve immediately. Wipe out skillet with paper towel and repeat process with remaining ground beef pucks.\nSerious Eats / Andrew Janjigian\nSpecial Equipment\nHeavy-bottomed\nstainless steel\n,\ncarbon steel\n, or\ncast iron skillet\n; large, firm\nmetal spatula\nNotes\nFor best results, ask your butcher to freshly grind beef for you, or\ndo it yourself at home\n. You can use straight ground chuck, or for better flavor, use a blend of short rib, brisket, and chuck or oxtail meat.\nProper care of your meat grinder\nis critical if you choose to grind at home.

Patties can also be cooked one at a time using a smaller skillet.\nRead More\nThe Ultimate Smash Cheeseburger Recipe\nOklahoma-Style Onion Burgers Recipe\nThe Fake Shack (or the Shack Burger at Home) Recipe\n10 Tips for Better Burgers\nMastering the Art of Burger Blending with Eight Cuts of Beef\nBurgers\nStovetop Beef\nGround Beef\nBeef"
