  "full_text": "Galam Plee Pad Nam Pla (Thai Stir-Fried Cabbage With Fish Sauce and Garlic) Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n10 mins\nTotal\n10 mins\nServes\n2\nto 4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 tablespoon (\n15\nml\n)\nvegetable oil\n5\ngarlic cloves\n(\n20\ng\n), crushed and roughly chopped (see notes)\n1/2 small head\ngreen cabbage\n, cored, leaves separated and cut into 2-inch pieces (yielding about 7 ounces;\n200\ng\ntotal)\n1 tablespoon (\n15\nml\n)\nfish sauce\nGround white pepper\nCooked jasmine rice\n, for serving\nDirections\nIn a wok or large carbon steel or stainless steel skillet, heat oil over high heat until just smoking. Move wok off-heat, add the garlic, and cook, keeping the wok off-heat and stirring constantly to prevent garlic from burning, until fragrant and lightly golden, about 30 seconds.\nReturn wok to high heat, add the cabbage, and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly to ensure garlic doesn\u2019t burn and cabbage is evenly coated in oil. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, and begin to carefully add a few drops of water, in 1/4-teaspoon increments around the sides of the wok, making sure water has fully evaporated between each addition, until cabbage is crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes.\nAdd fish sauce around the sides of the wok, and continue to cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until fish sauce is fully absorbed into the cabbage, about 30 seconds. Season to taste with white pepper, transfer to a serving plate, and serve immediately with cooked jasmine rice on the side.\nSpecial equipment\nWok\n, or large carbon steel or stainless steel skillet\nNotes\nThe garlic in this dish is intentionally roughly chopped into pieces of varying sizes; do not finely mince the garlic as it will burn more easily. To prepare imperfectly perfect chopped garlic, smash the peeled cloves on a cutting board with the back of a knife, then give them a coarse chop.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStir-fried cabbage is best enjoyed immediately.\nRecipes By Method\nAsian\nThai\nCabbage\nGarlic",
