  "full_text": "Dinner Tonight: Lamb Chops with Garlic and Anchovies Recipe\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n35 mins\nTotal\n40 mins\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n2\nlamb chops\n1\nhead\ngarlic\n1\ntablespoon\nolive oil\n1/2\ncup\nwhite wine\n2\nanchovy\nfilets\n, chopped\nsalt\nand\npepper\nDirections\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Break up the head of garlic into cloves, but don\u2019t peel them. Just give them a good whack to slightly crush them.\nHeat the oil in an iron skillet set over medium high heat. Toss in the garlic cloves and saut\u00e9 until slightly browned, about 3-4 minutes. Add the chops. Sear on both sides for about a minute or two, until browned. Season with salt and pepper after a side has cooked. Remove the chops and garlic.\nPour in the wine and let reduce by half. Dump the chops and garlic back into the skillet and add the chopped anchovy filets.\nPlace the iron skillet in the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, basting half-way. My own chops were done much closer to 15.\nServe the chops with the sweet garlic piled on top and some of the liquid leftover from the roast.\nLamb Mains\nLamb Chops",
