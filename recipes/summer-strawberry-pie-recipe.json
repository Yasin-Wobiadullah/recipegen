Firmly press into an even layer lining the bottom and sides of a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate; it helps to use the bottom of a measuring cup to flatten bottom of crust evenly. Refrigerate until ready to fill.\nFor the Strawberry Filling:\nPlace 12 ounces of strawberries in a food processor or blender and blend to a smooth pur\u00e9e. You should have about 3/4 cup pur\u00e9e (it's okay to have up to a cup).Transfer to a 2-cup liquid measuring cup and set aside.\nCut remaining strawberries into 3/4-inch slices, transfer to a large bowl, and stir in the sugar. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until berries release about 3/4 cup liquid, about 1 hour. Measure out enough macerating liquid to combine with strawberry pur\u00e9e for 1 1/2 cups total. Drain macerated berries of any extra liquid; reserve extra liquid for another use or discard.\nPlace 2 tablespoons water in a small microwave-safe bowl. Sprinkle gelatin evenly on top and let stand 5 minutes. Microwave gelatin mixture in 10-second intervals until gelatin is melted and hot, about 10 seconds.\nScrape melted gelatin into a large bowl, then gradually whisk in strawberry puree mixture until well combined. Whisk in salt.\nAdd drained macerated strawberry chunks and stir to combine. Adjust taste with lemon juice, if desired, then immediately pour into the prepared pie crust. Turn the berries on top skin side up for best presentation. Refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours. Serve with whipped cream.\nSpecial Equipment\n9 1/2-inch deep-dish\npie plate\n,\nfood processor\nor\nblender\n, 2-cup liquid\nmeasuring cup\nNotes\nIt's okay to have slightly more or less strawberry puree than what's called for here. The macerating time for the strawberries will depend on how juicy your berries are. Lemon juice is optional\u2014I like the pure flavor of strawberries without the lemon juice, but you may wish to add some, as it can help balance the flavor and make it pop more.\nRead More\nStrawberry Rhubarb Pie Recipe\n5-Ingredient Strawberry Shortcakes\nStrawberry Pretzel Salad\nLemon Icebox Cake Recipe\nNo-Bake Cheesecake With Freeze-Dried Fruit Recipe\nPies\nNo-Cook Desserts\nStrawberry\nMemorial Day",
