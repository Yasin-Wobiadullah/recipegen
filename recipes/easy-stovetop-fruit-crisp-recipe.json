Melt butter in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in flour mixture until moistened and mixture forms small clumps. Return to low heat and cook, stirring frequently, until streusel is golden brown and well toasted, 6 to 9 minutes. Transfer streusel to a large plate to cool (see note). Streusel can be made up to 5 days ahead. After cooling completely, store in an airtight container at room temperature.\nFor the Filling:\nStir sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Add butter, plums, and sugar mixture to skillet and heat over medium heat, stirring, until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute.\nIncrease heat to medium, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until plums are almost softened, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove lid and cook until plums are cooked through and mixture has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes more.\nImmediately top plums with streusel and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch\nnonstick skillet\nwith lid\nNotes\nI used hazelnuts because that's what I had on hand, but any nut such as pecan, almond, or walnut will work.\nWhen toasting the streusel, take care not to burn it. As it cools it will become crisp. Other fruit such as apples, pears, apricots, nectarines, or peaches can be used in place of the plums.\nRead More\nThe Best Apple Crisp\nStrawberry-Rhubarb Crisp\nBourbon Peach and Raspberry Crisp\nEasy Stovetop Cherry Grunt (Stovetop Cobbler)\nStovetop Fruit\nPlum\nFall Desserts\nThanksgiving Desserts\nChristmas Desserts"
