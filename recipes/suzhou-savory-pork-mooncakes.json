Place approximately one tablespoon of pork mixture in center of dough circle. Draw dough edges around filling and pleat edges to form a sealed topknot.\nPlace mooncake topknot-side-down on a parchment-lined baking tray. Repeat with remaining dough circles. Brush the top of each mooncake with egg glaze and bake until golden and crisp, about 20 minutes.\nServe immediately, or bake up to three days ahead and refrigerate, covered, until needed.
