Roughly mash tomatoes with a whisk or a potato masher. Add 2 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nTransfer half of the soup to the jar of a blender. Blend soup, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high. With blender running on high, gradually trickle in half of remaining olive oil. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with remaining half of soup and olive oil. Ladle into individual serving bowls, top with minced herbs, drizzle with more olive oil, and serve with toast or grilled cheese.\nSerious Eats / Eric Kleinberg\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nBe careful starting up the blender, the soup can shoot out the top. Open the vent and hold a kitchen towel over the lid to prevent blowout.\nSoups\nVegan\nVegan Mains\nTomato\nQuick Dinners",
