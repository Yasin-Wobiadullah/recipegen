Add the cubes of tofu and cook, turning the pieces occasionally, until golden and crisp all over. Transfer to a sheet pan lined with paper towels and set aside.\nWipe out the skillet with a paper towel and add 3 tablespoons of the butter. Heat the skillet over medium until the foam subsides, then add the shallots, chiles, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring often, until completely soft.\nAdd the soy sauces to the skillet, along with the sugar and peppercorns. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, then add the tofu back to the skillet and stir to coat it well. Taste for a balance of sweet and spicy, adding sugar or more peppercorns as needed (keep in mind the sauce is meant to be very intense and may well be salty).\nAdd the remaining tablespoon of butter and turn off the heat. Stir well until the butter is just melted into the sauce (it should make it somewhat shiny). Add the scallions and stir, then serve with white rice.\nStovetop Tofu"
