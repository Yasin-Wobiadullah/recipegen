Tear off the abdomen and halve the crab with the cleaver. Remove the gills and reserve the innards. Chop the body of the crab into segments aligned with the legs, so that each section comes attached to an appendage. If desired, use the majority of the crab for stir-frying, reserving just a few segments as well as the innards for steaming.\nArrange the rice noodles on a platter to be inserted into your steamer. If using cellophane noodles, soak the noodles for 10 minutes in cold water to slightly rehydrate them. Then arrange the noodles on the platter.\nArrange the pieces of crab on top of the noodles, along with the innards, ginger and green onions. Drizzle the soy sauce and fish sauce over the crab.\nSteam for 10 minutes, until the pieces of crab are just cooked through and the noodles are soft and supple. Serve immediately, accompanied by extra fish sauce on the side.\nCrab\nAsian",
