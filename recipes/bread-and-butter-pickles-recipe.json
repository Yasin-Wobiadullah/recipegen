Refrigerate for one hour to remove excess liquid. Meanwhile, prepare two pint jars and a small canning pot. Rinse vegetables and discard liquid.\nCombine the vinegar and sugar in a large pot. Heat over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Add the mustard seeds, celery seeds, red pepper flakes and cloves. Increase the heat to high and bring the brine to a boil.\nAdd the drained vegetables and stir to combine. Cook for 5 minutes, until all the vegetables in the brine are fully heated through. Using tongs, fill the sterilized jars with the vegetables. Slowly pour the hot brine over the vegetables in each jar, leaving 1/2 inch headspace.\nSerious Eats / Marisa McClellan\nGently tap the jars on a towel-lined countertop to help loosen any bubbles before using a wooden chopstick to dislodge any remaining bubbles. Check the headspace again and add more brine if necessary.\nWipe the rims, apply the lids and rings, and process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes. Let these pickles cure for at least 48 hours before eating.\nSpecial Equipment\nPint-sized canning jars with lids and rings,\nequipment for boiling-water bath canning\nRead More\nA Beginner's Guide to Canning\nPickle Science: How to Master the Preserving Power of Acids\nGarlic Dill Pickles\nSweet and Spicy Pickle Relish\nQuick Dill Pickle Chips Recipe for Burgers & Sandwiches\nCucumbers\nPickling"
