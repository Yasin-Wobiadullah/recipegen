In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, rum and vanilla to blend thoroughly. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and mix with the whisk, stopping when everything is just combined. (Don't worry if the batter is a bit lumpy.) With a rubber spatula, gently but thoroughly fold in the pumpkin puree.\nIf necessary, lightly butter, oil or spray your griddle or skillet. Preheat over medium heat or, if you're using an electric griddle, set it to 350\u00b0F. If you want to hold the pancakes until serving time (or for up to 20 minutes), preheat your oven to 200\u00b0F.\nSpoon 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake, allowing space for spreading. When the undersides of the pancakes are golden and the tops are lightly speckled with bubbles that pop and stay open, flip the pancakes over with a wide spatula and cook until the other sides are light brown. (These are soft and puffy, so turn carefully.) Serve immediately, or keep the finished pancakes in the preheated oven while you make the rest of the batch.\nPancakes\nButtermilk\nPumpkin\nFall Breakfast & Brunch"
