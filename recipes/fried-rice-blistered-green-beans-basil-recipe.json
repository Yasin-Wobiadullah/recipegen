Heat 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until rice is pale brown, toasted, and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd 1/2 tablespoon oil to now-empty wok and heat over high heat until smoking. Add green beans and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until deeply blistered and charred. Add scallions, garlic, and chiles and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until aromatic, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nReturn rice to wok. Add soy sauce and fish sauce and toss to combine.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPush rice to the side of wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Break egg into oil and season with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss egg and rice together.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nStir in basil leaves. Season to taste with salt, white pepper, and sugar, and serve immediately with lime, cucumber, and extra fish sauce and sliced chiles if desired.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nNotes\nFor best results, use Chinese-style medium-grain rice, jasmine rice, or sushi rice. Rice should either be cooked fresh, spread on a tray, and allowed to cool for 5 minutes, or, alternatively, transferred to a loosely covered container and refrigerated for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days.\nRead More\nPerfect Egg Fried Rice (On Whatever Gear You Have)\nBok Choy and Kale Fried Rice With Fried Garlic\nFried Rice With Chinese Sausage, Cabbage, and Torch Hei\nThai-Style Crab Fried Rice\nEasy Gan Bian Si Ji Dou (Sichuan Dry-Fried Green Beans)\n\"Dry-Fried\" Green Beans With Romesco Sauce\nRice & Grain Mains\nStovetop\nWhite Rice\nGreen Beans\nBasil",
