Add melted butter and vanilla extract. Stir until mixture resembles fine crumbs. You don't want too make large crumbs---those can sink to the bottom of the cake during baking. Set aside.\nPrepare the cake:\nPreheat oven to 350 \u00b0F;. Spray 24 muffin cavities with nonstick cooking spray. In large bowl, whisk together granulated sugar, white rice flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In small bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, oil, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Pour wet ingredients over dry ingredients. Whisk until smooth. Batter will be thin.\nFill prepared muffin cups half full. Generously and gently sprinkle prepared topping over each cake, about one tablespoon each. Bake cakes until golden brown. They should spring back to the touch, about 18 minutes.\nRemove pan from oven. Allow cakes to cool in pan for five minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. To remove cakes from the pan, run a metal spatula around the edges of the cake and use the spatula to lift the cake out of the pan. Store cakes in a covered container for up to three days on the counter or freeze cooled cakes for up to one month.\nSpecial equipment\nmuffin pan\nCakes\nGluten-free\nBaking"
