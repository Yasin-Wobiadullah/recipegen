Season veal shanks all over with salt and pepper. If you have butcher's twine, you can tie a length of it tightly around the circumference of each shank; this can help them hold their shape during cooking, but is not absolutely necessary.\nAdd flour to a shallow bowl. In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, lightly dredge shanks all over in flour, shaking off excess, and add to Dutch oven; be careful not to over-crown the shanks. Cook shanks, turning occasionally, until lightly browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side; lower heat as necessary at any point to prevent scorching. Transfer browned shanks to a platter and repeat with remaining shanks; add more oil to Dutch oven at any point if it becomes too dry.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd butter to Dutch oven, along with onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring, over medium-high heat until vegetables are softened and just starting to turn a light golden color, about 6 minutes.\nAdd tomatoes, wine, and stock to Dutch oven, along with veal shanks and any accumulated juices. Try to arrange the shanks in as even a layer as possible (a little overlap is okay to make them fit). The liquid should nearly but not totally cover the shanks; if it doesn't, add more stock or water until it does. Add thyme and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPrepare a parchment paper lid\nfollowing these instructions\n. Cover shanks with parchment lid and transfer to oven. Cook for 2 hours.\nMeanwhile, for the Gremolata:\nIn a small bowl, stir together parsley, lemon zest, and garlic. Set aside.\nRemove parchment paper lid from shanks and continue cooking until they are fork-tender, about 1 hour longer. If the pot becomes too dry, add more stock or water as needed to keep it moist; evaporation and reduction are good, but the pot shouldn't go dry. Feel free to move the shanks around so that any that are submerged can be exposed to the oven air. During the last 20 minutes of cooking, stir in 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10ml) gremolata, depending on how strong you want the lemon and garlic flavor to be.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCarefully transfer shanks to a platter. (Using a spatula and tongs together can help prevent them from falling apart.) Using a spoon, carefully scrape off any excess fat on surface of braising juices. The liquid should be saucy and thick; you can adjust the consistency by adding either water or stock to thin the sauce, or simmering it on the stovetop until more fully reduced. Discard thyme and bay leaf and season with salt and pepper if necessary.\nRemove twine from shanks, if used. Serve shanks on plates, spooning braising sauce on top and passing remaining gremolata at the table for diners to sprinkle as a garnish to their own taste; make sure to offer small spoons for scooping out marrow from bones. Osso buco is traditionally served with\nrisotto alla Milanese\n.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nparchment paper\n, butcher's twine (optional)\nNotes\nFor the best sauce, we recommend truly mincing the vegetables; larger chunks don't break down into a thickened sauce in quite the same way. If your knife skills aren't up to the task, use a food processor to pulverize them quickly and effectively. Using a food processor often releases some of the vegetables' liquids, so be sure to add those to the pot, too.\nIf using store-bought broth,\nadd about 2 teaspoons powdered gelatin\nto the broth and let it hydrate before using.\nRead More\nHow Much Liquid Should I Use When Braising?\nSlow-Cooker Beef Shank Osso Buco With Lemon-Parsley Gremolata\nRed Wine-Braised Beef Shanks\nTender Braised Lamb Shanks With Bitter Herb Salad\nRed Wine\u2013Braised Beef Short Ribs\nItalian\nChristmas Dinners\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nVeal\nBeef Mains",
