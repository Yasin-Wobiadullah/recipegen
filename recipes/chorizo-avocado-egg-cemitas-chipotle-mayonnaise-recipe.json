Add the chorizo to the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and cook until the chorizo is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape the chorizo out of the pan and transfer to a large platter and set aside.\nReturn the pan to medium heat, then crack two eggs into the pan. Place a lid on the pan and cook the eggs until the whites are set, but the yolks are still runny, 3 to 4 minutes. There should be enough fat left from the chorizo to keep the eggs from sticking. Carefully transfer the eggs to another large platter and set aside.\nCut the cemita rolls in half crosswise, then slather the chipotle mayo on each of the halves. Equally distribute the chorizo sausage among the two bottom halves of the bread. Layer the cheese, lettuce, tomato, and avocado on top of the chorizo. Place an egg on each bottom half, then top the sandwich with the remaining top halves. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nLarge non-stick skillet\nBreakfast Sandwich\nMexican\nFried Eggs\nSausages\nAvocado"
