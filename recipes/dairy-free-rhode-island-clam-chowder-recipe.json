Cover with cold water and add enough salt to make water taste salty like the sea. Let clams stand for about 30 minutes, then lift from water and rinse. Inspect soaking water: if there is sand on the bottom of the bowl, discard water, rinse bowl well, and repeat soaking procedure until sand no longer accumulates on bottom of bowl.\nMeanwhile, place stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin over the top. (See note).\nAdd bacon to Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until bacon is crisp and fat has rendered, about 7 minutes. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.\nAdd wine, bring to a simmer, and cook until alcohol smell has cooked off, about 4 minutes. Add stock, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf and bring to a simmer.\nAdd clams. Cover and cook until clams begin to open, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer clams to a large heatproof bowl as they open. If any clams don't open, transfer them to a separate bowl, and attempt to open them by sliding a knife between the shells: any clams that smell good can be added to the others (discard any that smell bad or are filled with mud). Allow clams to cool slightly.\nAdd potatoes to soup and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, remove clam meat from shells. Discard shells and roughly chop clam meat, collecting all juices that accumulate. Skim most of the fat from the surface of the soup.\nAdd clam meat back to soup along with any juices and season with salt. Transfer to bowls, garnish with parsley and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nDutch oven or soup pot\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Clammiest Chowder: How to Make Rhode Island-Style Dairy-Free Clam Chowder\nSoups\nNew England\nDairy-free Mains\nClams"
