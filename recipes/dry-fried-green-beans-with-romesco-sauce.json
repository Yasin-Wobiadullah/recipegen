In a large bowl, toss green beans with 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and season lightly with salt. Arrange in a single layer on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Broil until beans are blistered and very lightly charred, 2 to 5 minutes, depending on strength of broiler. Return beans to bowl.\nToss beans with romesco sauce and parsley until well-coated, and drizzle with as much olive oil as needed to loosen the romesco so that it evenly coats the green beans like a thick dressing. Season with salt to taste, and serve, either warm or at room temperature.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dressed beans can be refrigerated for up to 4 days in an airtight container; to preserve the parsley's fresher flavor, leave it out until just before serving (it will still be fine if added at the beginning, just slightly softened as it sits in the romesco). Allow to come to room temperature or gently rewarm before serving.\nRead More\nThe Ultimate Homemade Green Bean Casserole\nGreen Beans\nRoasted Vegetables\nQuick Sides\nVegetable Sides"
