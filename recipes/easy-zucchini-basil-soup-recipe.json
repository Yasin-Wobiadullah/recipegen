Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add zucchini and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add half of basil, stir to combine, and add water.\nBring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until zucchini is tender but still bright green, about 10 minutes. Add remaining half of basil and blend soup using a handheld immersion blender or a countertop blender until it is as rough or as smooth as you like it. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice and serve, drizzling with additional olive oil at the table.\nSerious Eats / J.

The soup can be served hot, but is also delicious chilled on a hot day.\nRead More\nZucchini Recipes to Say Goodbye to the Summer Bounty\nHow to Make Creamy Vegetable Soups Without a Recipe\nHot or Cold Creamy Lettuce Soup\nMinty Garlic Scape Soup\nNo-Cook Blender Tomato Soup\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nVegan Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop Vegetables"
