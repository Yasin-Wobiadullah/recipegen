Using a Microplane grater, grate root into a bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients for the batter into the bowl. Stir to mix well. The batter will be thick and gluey.\nHeat a well-seasoned cast iron skillet or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add diced bacon and brown, rendering its fat, until bacon is lightly browned. Remove bacon and set aside, keeping fat in the warmed pan.\nAdd bacon to batter. Drop batter by dollops into pan, making small pancakes about 3 inches in diameter. Cook pancakes until they are brown on one side, about 40 seconds, then flip and cook on the other side until browned. Serve with soy sauce and sesame oil for dipping, if desired.\nNotes\nThe skin of naga-imo causes mild itching, so use a pair of gloves when handling the root.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nStovetop",
