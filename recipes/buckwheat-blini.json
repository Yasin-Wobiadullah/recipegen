In a medium bowl, whisk together buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, kosher salt, baking powder, and baking soda. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk, melted butter, egg yolks, and vegetable oil. Add buttermilk mixture to bowl with dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula to stir until just combined.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a small bowl using a whisk, or using an electric mixer, whisk egg whites until they hold stiff peaks. Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold egg whites into batter until just combined.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nHeat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle set to 350\u00b0F/177\u00b0C). Add a small amount of vegetable oil to the skillet and spread with a paper towel until no visible oil remains. Using a spoon, place silver dollar pancake\u2013sized circles of batter (about 2 1/2 inches in diameter) in the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface of the blini and bottom sides of blini are light golden brown, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCarefully flip blini and cook on second side until light golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Wrap finished blini in a clean kitchen towel, place towel on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and transfer to oven to keep warm. Repeat blini-cooking process until all of the batter is used up.\nServe blini with sour cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, chilled caviar or smoked salmon, and traditional accompaniments, such as finely minced shallots, sliced chives, and chopped hard-boiled eggs.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nnonstick skillet\n,\nwhisk\nor\nstand mixer\n,\nwire rack\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBlini are best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nYeasted Blini\nGalettes Bretonnes (Buckwheat Crepes) Recipe\nSerious Eats Guide: How to Buy Caviar\nHors D'Oeuvres\nNew Years\nStovetop\nBuckwheat\nPancakes",
