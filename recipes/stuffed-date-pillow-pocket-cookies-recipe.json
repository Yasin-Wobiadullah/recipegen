Flour a clean work surface and roll one piece of dough out to 1/8-inch thickness. Use 1 1/2-inch circle cookie cutter to cut dough into circles. Transfer bottom cookies to baking sheet. Top each circle with a rounded 1/2 teaspoon date mixture. Roll out remaining piece of dough. Cut into circles.\nTop each bottom cookie with another circle of dough. Use a fork to crimp and seal sides together. Brush each cookie with egg wash, then sprinkle with sugar. Bake until golden, 16 to 18 minutes, rotating pans front to back and top to bottom half way through baking. Let cool for 3 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. Once cooled, cookies can be stored in a sealed container at room temperature for up to 1 week.\nSpecial equipment\nElectric beater, food processor, 1 1/2-inch circle cookie cutter, baking sheet, parchment paper\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCookie Monster: Stuffed Date Cookies\nCookies\nChristmas Cookies",
