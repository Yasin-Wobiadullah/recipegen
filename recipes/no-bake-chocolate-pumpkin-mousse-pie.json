Add melted butter and pulse to moisten. (If mixture seems too dry, add more melted butter.) Transfer mixture to a pie plate and firmly press into bottom and up sides. Set in the fridge to chill while you make the pumpkin mousse.\nIn a large bowl, stir cream cheese, light brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves until completely incorporated. Stir in pumpkin and vanilla until smooth and incorporated.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip cream on medium-high speed until cream holds soft peaks that slowly dip down when whisk is pulled out of cream. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold into pumpkin mixture. Pour mousse into pie shell and chill in fridge while you prepare the cocoa whipped cream.\nInto unwashed mixer bowl, add all ingredients for the spiced cocoa whipped cream and chill in fridge for 30 minutes. Place bowl in standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment and whip on medium-high speed to almost stiff peak. Spread over top of pumpkin mousse. Chill pie until set, about 3 hours.\nPlace chocolate bar on work surface (see notes). Using a paring knife, scrape chocolate shavings from bar and use to garnish top of pie.\nSpecial Equipment\n9-inch pie plate\n,\nfood processor\n(optional),\nstand mixer\n,\nparing knife\nNotes\nI like to use Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers in the cookie crust. You can substitute chocolate graham crackers, just decrease the sugar by half.\nIf you don't have a food processor, place the cookies in a zip-lock bag and mash with a rolling pin.\nWhen making the chocolate shavings, it helps to have the chocolate at room temperature.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis pie can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\nRead More\nChocolate Mousse Cake\nPies\nNo-Cook Desserts\nChocolate\nPumpkin\nFall Desserts"
