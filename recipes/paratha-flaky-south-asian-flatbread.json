Add oil and rub evenly into flour, about 5 minutes. Make a well in the center of flour and pour in 1 cup (240ml) of warm water. Roughly combine flour and water with your fingers until just brought together, about 1 minute. Next, knead dough until it forms a sticky ball, about 5 minutes. Leave dough in bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a moist towel. Set aside to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.\nAfter dough has rested, divide into 8 equal portions. Work with one portion of dough at a time, keeping remaining dough covered with a moist towel or plastic wrap while not handling.\nFor the First Roll:\nOn a clean surface, roll out dough as thin as possible, sprinkling flour as needed to prevent dough from sticking to the rolling pin. The final dimensions of the dough should be roughly 16 inches by 10 inches, and should be paper thin and translucent.\nUsing a small offset spatula, dab 1 tablespoon (15g) of softened ghee across surface of rolled out dough. Sprinkle a pinch of flour over ghee. Starting from the top, roll dough sheet until it is coiled into one long snake. Coil each end of the dough log inward until they meet at the center, then fold the two coils onto each other and press together firmly. Repeat with remaining portions of dough. Set aside coiled dough balls to rest covered for at least one hour at room temperature and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.\nFor the Final Roll:\nOn a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin, roll each coiled dough ball into a circle about 8 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Lightly dust paratha, rolling pin, and counter with flour as needed to prevent sticking, dusting off any excess flour at the end. Rotate paratha after each roll to maintain an even shape. Cook rolled out parathas right away, or store between layers of parchment and wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nCooking the Parathas:\nPreheat a heavy gauge 10-12 inch skillet over medium-low heat. Working with one paratha at a time, cook in the dry skillet until dusty and dry to the touch, about 3 minutes per side. (After this first cook, the parathas can be stacked between sheets of parchment, wrapped in plastic, and stored in the refrigerator for 1 week or freezer for 3 months and cooked from frozen as needed).\nPreheat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of ghee and cook 1 paratha at a time until golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute per side. Once cooked through, scrunch paratha to release any built-up steam. Serve right away or hold warm wrapped in a kitchen towel and in a 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) oven for up to 1 hour.\nSpecial Equipment\nMixing bowls\n,\nballoon whisk\n,\nrolling pin\n, 12-inch\nheavy gauge skillet\nNotes\nTraditionally parathas are made with maida, a South Asian refined white flour. Maida is similar to all-purpose flour, having both the germ and bran removed before processing. All purpose flour is a fine substitute, but for a more authentic textured paratha you can find maida online and at your local Indian grocery store.\nIf you already have clarified butter or browned butter on hand, you can substitute either for ghee. In a pinch, regular whole butter or even Crisco can step up to the plate and create the same final texture, but keep in mind they can\u2019t deliver the same flavor as a long-cooked ghee.\nFeel free to multiply the recipe for your desired batch size.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nAfter the first cook, parathas can be stacked between sheets of parchment, wrapped in plastic, and stored in the refrigerator for 1 week or freezer for 3 months and cooked from frozen as needed.\nOnce parathas are cooked, they can be held warm wrapped in a kitchen towel and in a 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) oven for up to 1 hour.\nRead More\nHow to Stock an Indian Pantry\nBread\nSouth Asian\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop\nSides"
