When sugar has dissolved, add beef, scallion, and onion slices to bowl and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.\nIn a large cast iron or heavy stainless steel skillet, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add beef and onions, working quickly to arrange them in a flat, even layer against bottom of skillet; try not to overcrowd pan. Cook on one side for 1 minute, then flip and cook second side until browned and crisp in spots, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer cooked beef and onions to a plate and repeat with remaining beef, onions, and oil.\nFor the Burritos:\nIn a small bowl, stir together sour cream and gochujang. Spread rice onto warm tortillas, then top with a layer of beef and onions, followed by kimchi, a few pickled daikon radish strips, red cabbage, cilantro, scallions, and gochujang sour cream. Roll tightly, folding sides of tortilla in as you go. (Wrapping the burritos in foil will make them portable and less messy to eat.) Serve with lime wedges.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge cast iron skillet\nor heavy-bottomed\nstainless steel skillet\nNotes\nIf you're slicing the beef yourself, it helps to freeze it slightly first and use a very sharp slicing knife. Even easier is to find the beef presliced at a Korean or Japanese market.\nIf you can't find Asian pear, you can use about 2 tablespoons (30ml) pineapple juice to get a similar tenderizing effect. However, in that case, don't marinate the beef for more than 2 hours, as pineapple can over-tenderize the meat. If using beef ribeye, you can omit the Asian pear and the pineapple, as it is a naturally tender cut.\nRead More\nAn Introduction to Korean Barbecue\nGrilled Korean-Style Bulgogi Burgers With Kimchi Mayo and Pickled Daikon\nCrispy Bulgogi-Filled Scallion Pancakes\n13 Burrito Styles Everyone Should Know\nBeef Mains\nKorean\nStovetop Beef\nBeef\nRice & Grains"
