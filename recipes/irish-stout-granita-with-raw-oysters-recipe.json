Place the dish into the freezer.\nStart checking the dish after 20 minutes. Once the mixture begins freezing around the edges, use a fork to stir the mixture and break up any large pieces of ice. Rake the frozen crystals toward the center of the dish.\nReturn the dish to the freezer and check the mixture every 10 minutes, continuing to scrape and break apart any large chunks of ice and rake them to the center of the dish. Repeat every 10 minutes until you have very fine, almost snow-like, crystals. Because there is so little liquid in this granita, it won't take long to freeze completely.\nWhen ready to serve, shuck oysters. Shake a few dashes of malt vinegar onto each of the shucked oysters, between 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon depending on taste. Spoon some of the granita onto each of the shucked oysters, then garnish each with the additional lemon zest, shallots, and parsley. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\n8- by 8-inch baking dish\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSerious Entertaining: A Blowout Christmas Dinner\nSerious Entertaining: A Summer Seafood Dinner\nSnacks & Appetizers\nNo-Cook\nOysters"
