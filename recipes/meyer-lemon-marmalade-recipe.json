Cut the strips lengthwise into very thin slices. Transfer the strips to a large, heavy-bottomed pot and add 2 1/2 cups of water and the baking soda. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the peels have softened, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, using a sharp knife, cut the remaining pith (white part) from the lemons. Working over a bowl to catch the juices, cut the lemon into segments. Put the segments in the bowl and squeeze the membrane to release as much juice as possible.\nMeasure the lemon segments and juices (removing any seeds). You should have about 1 cup. Add the segments and juices to the pot. Add butter. Sprinkle pectin over the mixture and bring it to a boil, stirring constantly.\nAdd sugar all at once. Return to full boil, stirring constantly. Boil hard for one minute. Remove the pot from the heat and skim any foam from the surface of the marmalade. Ladle the marmalade into hot sterilized jars and process them in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nPreserved: Meyer Lemon Marmalade\nJams & Jellies"
