(See this\nguide to cutting chicken breasts into cutlets\nfor step-by-step directions.) Season generously with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, or for best results, refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight after seasoning.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nSet a (6-quart) air fryer to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and preheat for 5 minutes. Place flour, beaten eggs, and panko in three separate shallow bowls. Add oil to the panko and stir until the panko is well-coated. Working with one cutlet at a time, dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip chicken in egg, then dredge in panko, pressing gently to help panko adhere; transfer chicken to a plate. Repeat the process with the remaining cutlet.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nPlace the prepared cutlets into the preheated air-fryer basket. Spray the tops of the chicken with cooking spray. Cook until golden-brown, 6 to 8 minutes, then flip the chicken cutlets and spray the top of the cutlets with cooking spray. Cook until golden brown and internal temperature reaches 155\u00b0F (68\u2103), 6 to 8 minutes for breasts and 175\u2109 (80\u2103) for thighs. Transfer chicken to a cutting board. Sprinkle with additional salt to taste and let rest for 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nSlice katsu into thin strips. Serve with tonkatsu sauce, cabbage, and white rice, if using.\nSerious Eats / Morgan Hunt Glaze\nSpecial Equipment\nAir Fryer\nNotes\nThis recipe can easily be doubled and cooked in 2 batches. Hold the cooked cutlets warm in a 200\u00b0F (95\u00b0C) oven on a wire rack\u2013lined rimmed baking sheet while cooking the other two cutlets.\nChicken Mains\nThe Latest\nChicken\nJapanese\nAir Fryer Recipes",
