Add rice and cook, stirring, until they turn translucent around the edges, about 3 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons butter and leeks and cook, stirring, until butter is melted and leeks are tender but not browned, about 5 minutes.\nAdd wine and simmer, stirring, until it has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup warm stock and stir until almost all the liquid has been absorbed. Continue cooking the rice, adding the broth in 1/2-cup additions, and stirring until the liquid is absorbed before the next addition, until rice is al dente, about 20 minutes. The rice can be kept warm at this point until ready to finish.\nWhen ready to finish, stir in enough warm stock to loosen risotto to a creamy consistency. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, mascarpone, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and lemon zest and juice. Season with salt and pepper. When finished, the grains of rice should be suspended in a thick and creamy sauce; if risotto thickens too much, simply add additional warm stock or water to restore proper consistency.\nMeanwhile, for the Lemon-Brown Butter Sauce:\nAdd butter to a small saucepan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring and swirling the pan every few seconds, until the foam subsides and the butter begins to turn golden brown and smells nutty, about 3 minutes. Off the heat, stir in garlic and let it sizzle for about 10-15 seconds, then add lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper; keep warm.\nFor the Scallops:\nSeason scallops with salt. Let stand in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.\nRemove salted scallops from the refrigerator and pat dry. Season lightly with a little more salt. Heat vegetable oil in a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add scallops, leaving space between each one. Press each scallop down very lightly with a spatula to ensure good contact with the pan.\nCook scallops without moving them until well browned on first side, 1-2 minutes. Carefully flip scallops and cook until seared on opposite side and medium-rare within, about 1 minute longer. Transfer scallops to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. To serve, scoop risotto into warmed bowls, top with scallops, and drizzle with the sauce. Top with a few peppers, if using.\nNotes\nYou will likely have leftover risotto, which can be refrigerated overnight and reheated in a saucepan by stirring in hot broth or water.\nRead More\n18 Date-Night Recipes for a Cozy Meal at Home\n34 Valentine's Day Recipes for a Romantic Dinner at Home\nThe Best Seared Scallops Recipe\nSeared Scallops With Buttermilk Beurre Blanc Recipe\nRisotto ai Gamberi (Shrimp Risotto) Recipe\nGreen Risotto With Mushrooms (Vegan) Recipe\nSeafood Mains\nItalian\nStovetop Seafood\nRice & Grains\nScallops"
