If using fresh masa, combine with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Divide mixture into 8 balls. Cover with plastic wrap.\nAdd drained beans to food processor with 2 tablespoons water. Blend until smooth, adding water as needed until texture resembles masa.\nPreheat heavy 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Meanwhile, form one ball masa into an egg shape. Using thumb, make deep, wide hole. Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons black bean mixture into hole. Pinch the masa up to enclose it and roll into a cigar shape. Place between two sheets of plastic and flatten gently with tortilla press or under heavy skillet until 1/4-inch thick. Carefully peel off top sheet of plastic. Flip the masa onto your fingers and peel the bottom sheet of plastic. Transfer quickly to skillet and cook until small lightly browned in spots, about 1 minute. Flip and cook until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove and set aside on plate. Repeat with other balls.\nPour enough oil into the skillet to generously coat bottom heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Slide two huaraches into skillet. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes and flip. Coat top side with 1 1/2 tablespoons salsa and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cheese. Cook one minute longer. Set aside and repeat with the other huaraches.\nTop the huaraches with onion, cilantro, and radishes. Serve immediately with lime wedges.\nBlack Beans",
