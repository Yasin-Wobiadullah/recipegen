It should register 180 to 190\u00b0F (82 to 88\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Carefully break 1 egg into a small bowl, then tip into a fine-mesh strainer. Carefully swirl egg around strainer, using your finger to rub off any excess loose egg whites that drop through.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nGently tip egg into water. Swirl gently with a wooden spoon for 10 seconds, just until egg begins to set. Repeat straining and tipping with remaining eggs. Cook, swirling occasionally, until egg whites are fully set but yolks are still soft, about 4 minutes.\nCarefully lift eggs from pot with a slotted spoon. Serve immediately, or transfer to a bowl of cold water and refrigerate for up to 2 days. To serve, transfer to a bowl of hot water and let reheat for 2 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nIf you want to cook multiple eggs, just make sure that you have them cracked into separate dishes and ready to go. Once they're in the water, keep them moving around, flipping them from time to time with a slotted spoon so that they cook evenly.\nRead More\nSous-Vide Soft-Poached Eggs Recipe\nPoached Eggs\nBreakfast & Brunch\nEaster\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
