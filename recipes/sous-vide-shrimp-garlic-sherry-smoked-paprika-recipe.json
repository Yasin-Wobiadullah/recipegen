Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nIn a large bowl, toss shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and the baking soda. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nHeat olive oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until garlic sizzles and softens but is not browned, about 3 minutes. Add paprika and bay leaves and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sherry and sherry vinegar, increase heat to high, and cook until the liquid is reduced and sauce starts to emulsify, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter. Season to taste with salt. Let cool about 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPlace shrimp in a heavy duty zipper-lock bag or a vacuum bag. Pour in oil/garlic mixture. Remove all air from bag using the\nwater displacement method\nor a vacuum sealer. Press shrimp into a single layer.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd bagged shrimp to preheated water bath and cook for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour (the texture should show very little variation within this time frame).\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPour cooked shrimp and sauce into a warm bowl and serve. Alternatively, preheat a cast iron skillet over high heat until a bead of water dropped in sizzles immediately. Place on a trivet and pour in the shrimp/oil mixture. Serve immediately, passing bread for sopping up the extra sauce.\nSpecial Equipment\nImmersion circulator\nNotes\nYou can also cook shell-on shrimp. They will be more flavorful, but you'll either have to shell before serving, or have diners shell them on their own (or just eat the shells, they're delicious). For shell-on shrimp, add 5 minutes to the minimum cooking time.\nRead More\nGambas al Ajillo (Spanish-Style Garlic Shrimp)\nShrimp Scampi With Garlic, Red Pepper Flakes, and Herbs\nTacos de Camarones al Mojo de Ajo (Saut\u00e9ed Shrimp Tacos)\nA Comprehensive Guide to Buying Better Shrimp\nEasy Techniques to Improve Any Shrimp Recipe\nSeafood Mains\nSpanish\nSous Vide Seafood\nShrimp",
