Cut off the fatty rind if there is one. Season the chops all over with salt, pepper, and thyme, pressing the seasoning gently into the meat so it sticks.\nPreheat a wide skillet or saut\u00e9 pan with the olive oil over medium heat. Bring a pot of salted water to boil for the gnocchi. Add the pork to the hot skillet and cook 5 minutes on each side, until nicely golden brown. Add the gnocchi to pot and cook 2 minutes until it floats to the top of the water, and drain.\nWith the pork still in the pan, add the cider and then the cream. Cook another 5 minutes until the pork is cooked through and the sauce is reduced. Toss the gnocchi in the sauce with the pork chops and serve right away with a light green salad.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nFrench in a Flash: Pork Chops with Norman Cider Cream Sauce and Thyme\nPork Mains\nStovetop Pork\nPork Chop\nQuick Dinners"
