  "full_text": "Niter Kibbeh Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n105 mins\nTotal\n105 mins\nServes\n12 servings\nMakes\n1 1/2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\npound\nunsalted butter\n1\nsmall\nonion\n, minced\n6\ncloves\ngarlic\n, peeled and smashed\n2\ninches\nginger\n, peeled and sliced thin\nTwo\n3-inch sticks\ncinnamon\n, or\n1\nteaspoon\nground\n8\ncrushed\ncardamom\npods\n, or\n1/2\nteaspoon\nground\n1\nteaspoon\nfenugreek\n,\nwhole\nor\nground\n1\nteaspoon\ncoriander\n,\nwhole\nor\nground\n2\nwhole\ncloves\n, or\n1/8\nteaspoon\nground\n2\nbay leaves\nDirections\nIn a saucepan, slowly melt the butter on low heat. Meanwhile, toast the spices. If grinding, toast beforehand.\nAdd all the spices to the butter, and reduce the heat to a bare simmer. Keep an eye on the pot every few minutes to make sure it\u2019s not boiling as the water evaporates. The milk solids will rise to the surface of the pot as the water cooks out.\nLet the butter simmer, with just a few bubbles popping through, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Like a good stock, longer cooking is better, but it needs to be gentle so the milk solids don\u2019t burn. If they do, the niter kibbeh will be irreparably bitter.\nWhen the solids have turned a pleasant brown and plenty of time has past, line a mesh strainer with a cheesecloth or paper towel and place it over a small storage container. Strain the butter well, making sure there are no milk solids or spices in the final product. Your niter kibbeh will last for months in the refrigerator. The larger a batch you make, the less butter you\u2019ll lose to straining.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Niter Kibbeh\nEast African\nEast African",
