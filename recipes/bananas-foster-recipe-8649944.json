Add bananas, cut side down, and continue to cook, swirling gently, until liquid begins to resemble a more smooth caramel, about 2 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nAdd rum (do not pour directly from the bottle if working over an open flame), then tilt pan to ignite the alcohol from a gas burner, or carefully light with a match. Cook, shaking the pan, until the flames have died out and the caramel has thickened to a honey consistency, about 1 to 2 minutes. Alternatively, you can add the rum and not light it on fire, instead simmering until the rum has mostly cooked off and the caramel has reached a honey consistency.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFlip bananas cut side up, then transfer to serving plates with ice cream (2 pieces of banana each for 6 servings; 3 pieces of banana each for 4 servings; 4 pieces of banana each for 3 servings; or 6 pieces of banana each for 2 servings, if you're as gluttonous as I was on the day we photographed this).\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBananas Foster is best made right before serving and eaten immediately.\nDesserts\nThe Latest\nBanana"
