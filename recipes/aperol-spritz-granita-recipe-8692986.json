Pour into an 8- by 8- inch square or 9- by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer until partially frozen, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nRun a fork through the mixture and around the edges of the pan, taking care to break up any large ice chunks. Return pan to freezer and repeat process every 30 minutes until little to no liquid remains, 4 to 5 hours. (The total time will vary depending on the temperature of your freezer and the size of your pan.)\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nServe in Champagne coupes or martini glasses. Garnish each glass with fresh mint leaves and an orange slice, if desired. For a slushy beverage, top each glass with a splash of seltzer or sparkling water.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nSpecial Equipment\n8- by 8- inch or 9- by 13-inch freezer-safe glass, ceramic, or metal dish, plastic wrap\nNotes\nSince Prosecco loses its effervescence once frozen, a dry or semi-sweet white wine may be used in its place for a similar effect.\nIf using store-bought juice, look for pulp-free or low-pulp juice. To remove pulp from freshly squeezed orange and lemon juice, strain juice through a fine-mesh sieve; discard pulp or reserve for other use.\nThe freezing time will depend on the temperature of your freezer and the size of your pan.\nThe Latest\nGluten-free Desserts\nDairy-free Desserts\nSummer Desserts\nGluten-free"
