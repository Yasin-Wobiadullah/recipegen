Cook, with a pinch of salt, stirring often. When onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes, add garlic and cook one more minute.\nAdd spinach, tossing to coat with oil, and add another small pinch of salt. Cook until spinach is very tender but not mushy, about 5 minutes, then turn off heat and stir in cheese. Add lemon zest, nutmeg, and dill. Salt to taste, and add lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon at a time tasting until desired flavor is achieved. Set aside.\nHeat oven to 400\u00b0F and adjust rack to middle position, then lightly dust a work surface and a rolling pin with flour. Roll puff pastry out into a 10- by 8-inch rectangle. Using a sharp knife, cut the puff pastry into four smaller rectangles.\nDock the center of each rectangle lightly with a fork, leaving half an inch of space on each side. Spoon 1/4 of filling into each rectangle and fold over like a book. To seal edges, crimp by lightly pressing down on them with the back of the fork.\nBake hand pies on a parchment-lined sheet pan until pastry is well-browned, firm, and dry, about 30 minutes. Or freeze pies on sheet pan for several hours, then transfer to a zip-top bag for long-term storage. Serve hand pies warm or at room temperature.\nSpecial Equipment\nRolling pin\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Nutmeg\nSnacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian\nSpinach",
