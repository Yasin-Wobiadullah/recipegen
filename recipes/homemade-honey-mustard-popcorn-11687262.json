Cover pot and set over medium-high heat. Cook, shaking pot often, until popcorn begins to pop. As soon as popping has slowed to once every few seconds, remove from heat. Let stand until all popping has stopped, then open pot and transfer popcorn to a large serving bowl.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nImmediately sprinkle honey-mustard seasoning mixture all over hot popcorn, tossing to evenly coat. Season with additional salt and drizzle with some liquid honey, if desired, then serve.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe popped and seasoned popcorn can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Do not pop the popcorn in advance and attempt to season it later, as the seasoning sticks best when the popcorn is fresh and hot.\nPopcorn\nThe Latest"
