Preheat oven with sheet to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C).\nAdd pancetta to a small skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring and tossing occasionally until crisp on all sides and fat is rendered, 5 to 10 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nTransfer to fine-mesh strainer set over large heat-proof bowl. You should have about 1 tablespoon of fat. Add neutral oil to the fat and toss sprouts in bowl until well coated. Sprinkle with salt, season with freshly ground black pepper, and toss to coat.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nWorking quickly, remove the baking sheet with oven mitts and spread sprouts into a single layer, cut side down. Roast until tender on top and browned on bottom, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nMeanwhile, make the glaze.\nIn a medium saucepan, whisk to combine sweet chili sauce, butter, fish sauce, water, and sriracha. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until sauce is bubbling and thick enough to coat a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nRemove sprouts from oven. Stir in reserved crisped pancetta or bacon and immediately drizzle with lime juice and shake to coat. Transfer to a serving platter. Drizzle glaze over the sprouts. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Deli Studios\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nLook for sprouts about 1 \u00bd inches in diameter with tight heads.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nLeftovers are best within 2 days. Freezing Brussels sprouts is not ideal because the texture changes somewhat unpleasantly once reheated.\nSauce can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool completely, cover, and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.\nBrussels Sprouts\nThe Latest\nVegetable Sides\nFall\nThanksgiving",
