If using pre-sliced steak, skip to chopping instructions in Step 2.\nUsing a sharp knife such as a slicing knife or chef\u2019s knife, shave steak as thinly as possible on a biased angle against the grain. Mound shaved meat on cutting board and chop coarsely with knife, about 5 times for store-bought sliced meat or 10 times for hand-sliced.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nHeat an empty 10-inch cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add oil to skillet and heat until just smoking. Add meat and onion in an even layer and cook, without stirring, until both are well browned on one side, 4 to 6 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring frequently to move and pull apart the meat slices, until meat and onions are browned and meat is no longer pink, 2 to 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nStir in provolone or American cheese, Parmesan cheese (if using), salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and mixture is well combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat and let cool slightly, about 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFor the Egg Rolls:\nFill small bowl with water; set aside. Working with 1 egg roll wrapper at a time, orient wrappers on counter so 1 corner points toward edge of counter. Place 1/8 of the cheese steak filling (about a packed 1/4 cup filling per egg roll) on lower half of wrapper and mold it with your fingers into neat cylindrical shape. Using your fingertips, moisten entire border edges of wrapper with thin film of water.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nFold bottom corner of wrapper up and over filling and press it down on other side of filling. Fold both side corners of wrapper in over filling and press gently to seal. Roll filling up over itself until wrapper is fully sealed. Leave egg roll seam-side down on counter and cover with damp paper towel while shaping remaining egg rolls.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nLine large plate with triple layer of paper towels. In a large Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot, add frying oil (oil should measure about 1 1/2 inches deep). Heat oil over medium-high heat to 350\u2109 (175\u2103). Using a spider skimmer or tongs, carefully lower 4 egg rolls one at a time, seam-side down, into hot oil and cook until deep golden brown, 4 to 8 minutes, flipping egg rolls about halfway through frying for even cooking. Adjust burner if needed to maintain oil temperature between 325 and 350\u2109 (160 to 175\u2103). Using a spider skimmer or tongs, carefully transfer fried egg rolls to prepared plate. Return oil to 350\u2109 (175\u2103) and repeat frying with remaining 4 egg rolls. Transfer to a prepared plate with other egg rolls. Serve with your preferred dipping sauce.\nSerious Eats / Qi Ai\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch cast iron or nonstick skillet, instant-read or deep-fry thermometer for temping oil, large Dutch oven or large heavy bottomed pot, spider skimmer or tongs\nNotes\nYou may also use store-bought pre-sliced well-marbled steak found at some supermarkets, including Wegmans, H-Mart, and other Asian markets. If using pre-sliced steak, still run a knife through the mound of meat about 5 times at the end of Step 2.\nIf you have a cast iron flat griddle pan or plancha, this is the time to use it for cooking the filling. If necessary, center over two burners for even heating.\nProvolone cheese can range from mild to very sharp. Go with your personal preference, but whatever you choose, the cheese should be sliced thinly and melt easily. You may also substitute with an equal weight of Cheez Whiz, American cheese, or Cooper Sharp\u2014a classic for cheesesteaks.\nThis recipe can easily be doubled. Cook the filling in a 12-inch skillet and fry the egg rolls in additional batches.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nAssembled egg rolls can be frozen for cooking at a later date: Freeze egg rolls on plate, then transfer to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 1 month. Do not thaw before cooking; increase cooking time by about 2 minutes.\nEgg rolls are best served fresh and leftovers do not store well.\nSnacks & Appetizers\nThe Latest\nGame Day\nFrying\nBeef",
