On a rimmed baking sheet, toss butternut squash and brussels sprouts with olive oil, black pepper, salt, cumin, and baking soda until evenly coated. Roast, rotating the tray halfway through and use a thin metal spatula to turn the vegetables 2 to 3 times during cooking, until the squash is tender and golden brown and the brussels sprouts are slightly crisp and beginning to char, about 30 minutes. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nMeanwhile, prepare the dressing: In a medium bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, honey, and garlic.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nHeat a small, dry stainless-steel skillet over medium heat. Add black peppercorns, cumin, coriander, and mustard seeds and cook, stirring, until lightly toasty and fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer to a small mortar and pestle. Grind the spices until finely ground, then whisk into the dressing, followed by the cilantro, dill, and chile pepper.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nTransfer the squash and brussels sprouts to a large mixing or serving bowl. Pour the dressing over the roasted vegetables and toss to coat well.

The dressing should be made the day of.\nBrussels Sprouts\nButternut Squash\nVegetarian Sides\nVegetarian"
