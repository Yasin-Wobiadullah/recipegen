  "full_text": "The Best Mashed Sweet Potatoes\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n2 hrs 10 mins\nCooling Time\n20 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 45 mins\nServes\n8\nto 10 servings\nMakes\n6 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n4\nlarge moist\nsweet potato\nes (\n4\npounds\n;\n1.8\nkg\n), such as ruby or garnet yams (about\n4\nlarge\npotatoes\n; see notes)\n8\n(6-inch) sprigs\nfresh thyme\n, divided\n6\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n(\n3\nounces\n;\n85\ng\n)\n1/4\ncup\n(\n60\nml\n)\nmaple syrup\n1/2\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\nDirections\nAdjust oven rack to middle position. Place 2 large sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil on a work surface. Working with 1 sheet at a time, place half of potatoes in center along with 3 sprigs of thyme. Fold up foil and crimp edges to seal tightly. Repeat with other half of potatoes and 3 sprigs of thyme. Transfer pouches to a rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Set oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Roast until a thin skewer inserted into potatoes meets some resistance, 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes. Carefully unwrap and discard foil and thyme sprigs and place unwrapped potatoes in even layer on same sheet pan. Increase oven temperature to 400\u00b0F (205\u00baC), and roast until sweet potatoes are caramelized and a thin skewer inserted into potatoes meets no resistance, about 30 minutes. Remove potatoes from oven and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes.\nWhile sweet potatoes are cooling, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling gently, until particles are pale golden brown and smell nutty, about 10 minutes. Immediately transfer to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add maple syrup. Pick leaves off of remaining 2 thyme sprigs, roughly chop (1/4 teaspoon), and add to bowl with butter and maple syrup.\nPeel sweet potatoes and discard skins and any juices. Add flesh to bowl with butter mixture. Beat with whisk attachment or a handheld mixer on medium-low speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Serve. See note for make-ahead suggestions.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nhandheld electric mixer\nor\nstand mixer\nNotes\nSweet potatoes can be made even sweeter by pretreating them in a water bath to activate their enzymes. To do this with a sous vide\u2013style circulator, set your circulator for 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C). Place the sweet potatoes directly in the water bath and let circulate for 2 to 4 hours before proceeding with the recipe, if doing sous vide potatoes, cut unwrapped potatoes in half lengthwise before returning to roast at 400\u00b0F. To do this with a beer cooler, fill your cooler with water at 170 to 175\u00b0F (77 to 79\u00b0C). Add the potatoes, cover, and let rest for 2 to 4 hours before proceeding.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nSweet potatoes can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. To store and reheat, transfer the sweet potatoes to a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag with the air pressed out. Reheat by completely submerging the zipper-lock bag in a pot full of hot (not boiling) water, removing the bag occasionally to squeeze contents around, until fully reheated, about 30 minutes. The best way to do this is with a sous vide\u2013style circulator set at 150\u00b0F (66\u00baC).\nThanksgiving Side Dishes\nGluten-free Sides\nVegetarian\nGluten-free\nFall",
