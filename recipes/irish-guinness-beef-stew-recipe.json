Pour chicken stock into a medium bowl and sprinkle gelatin evenly all over surface, allowing each packet's worth of gelatin to soak up stock before sprinkling next one on (if the gelatin clumps instead of dissolving evenly, you can use a blender to fix it). Set aside.\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with salt and pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nAdd split carrots, split parsnip, halved onions, and garlic to Dutch oven and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes; lower heat if browned bits on bottom of Dutch oven threaten to burn.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nScrape chicken stock and all gelatin into Dutch oven. Add coffee, chocolate, Guinness, bouquet garnis, fish sauce, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain simmer. Meanwhile, cut beef into 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add flour and stir until beef is evenly coated in a floury paste. Add beef and any accumulated juices to Dutch oven. Transfer to oven, cover with lid partially open, and cook for 1 hour, stirring every 30 minutes. Add potatoes and continue to cook until beef is starting to become tender, about 30 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in a large skillet, heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil. Add diced carrot, parsnip, and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nRemove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard large pieces of carrot, parsnip, and onion. Discard bouquet garnis. Using a ladle, skim off and discard accumulated fat on surface. Add reserved\nsaut\u00e9ed diced vegetables to stew\n, return to oven, and cover with lid slightly cracked. Continue to cook until beef and potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes longer, removing lid for last 25 minutes.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nRemove stew from oven. If serving right away, skim off any additional fat from surface. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. Allow to cool slightly before serving, then serve topped with parsley. If making ahead, cool down stew, then chill in refrigerator; remove solid fat cap from surface once fully chilled. Reheat stew on the stovetop or in a low oven.\nSerious Eats/Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nIf using homemade chicken stock that's rich with gelatin, you can decrease the gelatin in this recipe by half.\nSoups\nSt. Patrick's Day\nIrish\nBraised & Stewed Beef\nBeef Chuck"
