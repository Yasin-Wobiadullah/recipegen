Trace two 8-inch circles on 2 separate sheets of parchment paper. Flip over (so ink is on bottom) and place on baking sheets.\nPulse hazelnuts and 2 tablespoons sugar in food processor until finely ground. Transfer to bowl, toss with malted milk powder, and set aside. Place egg whites and cream of tartar in bowl of standing mixer fitted with whip attachment (see note). Beat on medium high speed to soft peaks. Slowly add remaining sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in salt.\nRemove from mixer and gently fold in hazelnut mixture in 3 batches until just combined (do not overmix). Spoon meringue into large pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch tip. Starting in the center of each circle, pipe in a spiral motion to form a disc shape meringue, keeping within about 1/2 inch from the border (see note). You should have just enough meringue to complete the 4 discs.\nPlace in oven and bake until completely dry, about 2 hours. Store in a cool, dry place until ready to assemble.\nHeat chocolate and cream in heatproof bowl over pan of barely simmering water, stirring gently, until just melted. Set aside (or chill) until just firm enough to spread.\nTo assemble torte, place a meringue on serving plate, top side up. Spread 1/4 cup ganache onto meringue. Continue to layer meringues and ganache, using remaining ganache to frost top and sides of torte. Garnish with malted milk balls. Chill to set, at least 2 hours. Use a hot, wet knife to cut slices.\nSpecial equipment\n2 large cookie sheets or sheet pans, food processor, pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch plain tip,1 8-inch cake pan or cake ring, mixer\nDesserts\nChocolate\nHazelnuts"
