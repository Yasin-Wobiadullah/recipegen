Add water, parsley sprigs, and tarragon sprigs. Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper, then nestle in cooking liquid; they should be partially submerged. Bring liquid to a simmer, then cover pan and lower heat. Cook, covered, until salmon is medium-rare and registers 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, toss tomatoes with scallion and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.\nUsing a slotted spatula, transfer salmon fillets to bowls. Season cooking broth with salt and pepper and ladle around salmon along with the vegetables. Spoon tomatoes and scallions all around, garnish with chopped parsley and tarragon, and serve right away.\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant-read thermometer\nRead More\nHalibut \u00e0 la Nage With Clams, Dill, and White Wine\nThai-Style Cod \u00e0 la Nage With Coconut Milk, Lime, and Lemongrass\nSalmon\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nPoached Seafood\nVegetables",
