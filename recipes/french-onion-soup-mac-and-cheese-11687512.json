Drain, then transfer pasta to a large mixing bowl; set aside.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nWhile pasta is cooking, in a Dutch oven, heat 4 tablespoons (60 g) butter over medium heat until melted. Add onions and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Uncover and reduce heat to medium-low.\u00a0 Continue cooking, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until onions become very soft and brown, 30 to 35 minutes. If browned onion juices on bottom of pot begin to burn, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) water, scrape up browned bits, and continue cooking; add water whenever needed to prevent burning.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nWhile onions caramelize, shred 1 pound (456 g) of Gruy\u00e8re and cube remaining 8 ounces (226 g) into 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside until ready to use.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nOnce onions have browned, increase heat to medium and stir in sherry 1 tablespoon thyme; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and liquid has evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nReturn now-empty Dutch oven to medium heat and melt 4 tablespoons (60 g) butter; add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until raw flour scent is gone, about 1 minute. Add milk in a thin, steady stream, whisking constantly and thoroughly and getting into all corners of the pan to create a smooth, lump-free texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking often, and cook until sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Whisk in mustard, bouillon, and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nRemove from heat and, working in increments, whisk in shredded Gruy\u00e8re until a smooth, emulsified cheese sauce forms; stir in reserved onions.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nScrape cheese sauce into pasta and mix until evenly coated. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes, then add cubed Gruy\u00e8re and mix well. Scrape pasta into a greased 9- by 13-inch baking dish and smooth surface into an even layer.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nIn a small bowl, combine panko, fried onions, and remaining 1/2 tablespoon thyme. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons (45 g) butter, then add to panko mixture and mix until evenly coated. Scatter panko mixture evenly over surface of mac and cheese. Bake until browned and bubbling, 12 to 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nLet mac and cheese rest for 15 minutes. Garnish with thyme leaves and serve.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Huffman\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pasta pot, Dutch oven, 9- by 13-inch baking dish\nMake Ahead and Storage\nThe pasta can be cooked, cooled, and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days before preparing the casserole.\nCheese can be shredded and cubed up to 1 week ahead and refrigerated in separate airtight containers.\nThe onions can be sliced ahead up to 1 day ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator or fully caramelized up to 1 week ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container.\nLeftover mac and cheese can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; it reheats surprisingly well in the microwave or oven\nMac & Cheese\nThe Latest\nSides"
