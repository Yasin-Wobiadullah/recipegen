Add salt pork (see note), chicken broth, bay leaves, thyme, onion, carrot, and celery. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a bare simmer and cook until beans are completely tender, about 1 hour, topping up with water as necessary (beans should be just poking through the top surface.\nDiscard bay leaves, thyme sprigs, onion, carrot, and celery. Remove pork and discard if desired or chop up and add back to pot. Add tomatoes and kale to pot, bring to a simmer, and cook, gently stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until thickened and stew-like, about 20 minutes longer.\nSeason to taste with salt and pepper and serve, topping with hard boiled eggs and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.\nNotes\nInstead of the salt pork, if you have leftover rind and bones leftover from roasted\nsuckling pig\nor\npork shoulder\n, use them! Ham bones work great as well.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nThe beans can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days and will improve with time. Reheat by microwaving or stir gently over medium heat, adding liquid as necessary.\nRead More\nThe Serious Eats Guide to Beans\nHow to Cook Dried Beans\nCheesy Mashed White Beans With Kale, Parmesan, and a Fried Egg\nHuevos Rancheros Verdes (Fried Eggs With Green Salsa and Refried Beans)\nLima Beans"
