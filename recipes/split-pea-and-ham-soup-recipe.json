Add onion, celery, and ham (if using diced ham) and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nAdd peas, chicken stock or water, and bay leaves; if using a ham hock, add it now. Stir to combine, bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cover, leaving lid slightly ajar. Cook until peas are tender, about 1 hour. If using a ham hock, transfer to a plate, let cool slightly, then pick meat, discarding bones.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nIf a creamier soup is desired, pulse soup using an immersion blender (or puree a portion of the peas and broth in a countertop blender before returning to soup pot), until very roughly pureed but still chunky. Return picked ham hock meat, if using, to soup. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\nimmersion blender\nor\ncountertop blender\nRead More\n30-Minute Pressure Cooker Split Pea and Ham Soup\nAmerican\nGluten-free Snacks & Appetizers\nStovetop\nSplit Peas\nHam",
