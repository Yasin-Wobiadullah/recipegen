Take care not to over-mix; the less air that is incorporated into the dough, the better. With mixer still running, add in egg yolks one at a time. Once incorporated, shut off mixer and scrape bowl down with a rubber spatula.\nIn the bowl of food processor, combine flour and peanuts; process for 1 minute then sift the mixture in a fine-mesh sieve; regrind any chunks that do not pass through and sift again. Discard any bits that do not pass through the sieve. If any chunks are included, it will be difficult to roll the dough sufficiently thin and those same chunks will clog your piping bag when you attempt to pipe a design on top.\nTurn mixer to its lowest setting and add rice flour and ground peanuts all at once. The mixture will be stiff. Continue mixing until uniform. Shut off mixer. Use a spatula to scrape the dough from the bowl and knead lightly to form a smooth ball. Use your hands to flatten into a disc.\nRefrigerate dough for 30 minutes, or until stiff enough to roll easily.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and have 2 parchment-lined baking sheets at the ready. Sift some flour onto the counter and use a rolling pin to roll the dough as thinly as you can manage, about 1/8 inch. (The cookies will puff and reach just shy of 1/4 inch after baking; thus dough rolled only to 1/4 inch will puff to 1/2 inch inch, making the finished, filled sandwich over an inch thick. Not good.)\nWhen finished rolling, slide a metal spatula between the dough and counter to loosen. This will prevent the cookies from sticking.\nA bikini/sunglass cutter, slightly stretched and widened, makes perfect \"Nutter Butters\" but use any cutter you like. Cut out the cookies and use a metal spatula to lift and transfer to cookie sheet.\nArrange cookies on parchment-lined cookie sheet. Set the sheets aside.\nGather up, knead, and re-roll remaining dough scraps, likewise cutting and arranging on a cookie sheet. The scraps can be re-rolled 2 more times.\nTo make a Nutter Butter pattern on the cookies, place any remaining dough scraps in a mixing bowl. Mix with a hand or stand mixer while adding hot water, one teaspoon at a time. Continue adding hot water until the dough has thinned into a paste. You can always add more liquid, but you can't take it away. Add slowly and let each addition mix in fully before adding more. When the mixture reaches a frosting-like consistency, use a spatula to scrape it out. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a very small tip, or a heavy duty Ziploc bag with a tiny hole poked in the corner.\nPipe some sort of design atop each cookie. Four vertical lines and several horizontal hashes will give the impression of a Nutter Butter, but any design will do.\nOnce cookies have been decorated, bake for about 12 minutes, or until firm to the touch. If your oven has an uneven heating element, rotate cookie sheets after 6 minutes. Once the cookies have baked, cool thoroughly, directly on the sheet pan.\nFor the Filling:\nWith a hand or stand mixer, cream together butter, peanut butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Cream on medium speed for 5 minutes; use a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl down periodically. The long mixing time makes the filling less gritty.\nUsing a spatula, transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip. Alternately, use a Ziploc bag with the corner snipped off as a makeshift pastry bag.\nTo assemble the cookies:\nFlip half the wafers over. Onto each, pipe a barbell shaped line of frosting down the center. Top with remaining wafers.\nTransfer cookies to an airtight container and refrigerate for several hours to set the filling. The cookies will keep for about one week.\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor\n, fine-mesh sieve, rolling pin, bikini/sunglass cookie cutter or other cookie cutter, zipper-top heavy-duty plastic bag\nNotes\nAll measurements are in weights, as volume measures can be very imprecise. I strongly recommend using a\nscale\nfor all pastry projects. Serious Eats' recommended kitchen scale is the Oxo Good Grips Scale with Pull Out Display.\nRead More\nHomemade Fig Newtons\nE.L.
