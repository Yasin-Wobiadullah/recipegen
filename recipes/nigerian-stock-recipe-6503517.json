Pour ginger-garlic mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into pot, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible before discarding the fiber. Add curry powder, dried thyme, bay leaves, black pepper, and a large pinch of salt. Add enough additional water to just cover all solid ingredients (about 2 1/2 quarts; 2.5L); stir to combine.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nCover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the stock is aromatic and the vegetables are soft, about 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nOff heat, remove the bones with a pair of tongs; if there\u2019s meat on the bones, you can pull it off later as a snack, but otherwise discard the bones.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables and bay leaves to the blender and puree with 1 cup (225ml) of stock until homogenous and smooth. Pour pureed vegetables through a fine-mesh strainer back into stock, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard remaining vegetable matter trapped in the strainer. Stir well to combine.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nUse stock as desired, or store in an airtight container for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer.\nSerious Eats / Maureen Celestine\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge pot or Dutch oven\nNotes\nThis recipe can be scaled up or down to make more or less stock, as desired.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe stock can be refrigerated in airtight containers for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months. For versatility, the stock can be frozen in an ice cube tray and then transferred to a zipper-lock bag, or divided into cup- or pint-sized batches, to be thawed for use in recipes large or small.\nNigerian\nChicken\nBeef\nThe Latest"
