Add bread and blend until very smooth. Season with salt, then blend in vinegar and olive oil. If using a less powerful blender, you may want to pass the soup through a fine-mesh strainer at this point; with a high-powered blender, that won't be necessary.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTransfer soup to a sealed container and refrigerate until very well chilled, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.\nTo Serve:\nCut up grapes into smaller pieces and toss with almonds, mint, and just enough olive oil to coat. Season garnish with salt. Shake or stir soup well. Check consistency and thin with cold water, if desired. Adjust seasoning, adding more salt and/or vinegar, if desired. Pour into chilled serving bowls. Spoon grape garnish on top, lightly drizzling more olive oil onto each serving in a decorative manner. Serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\n(optional)\nNotes\nRaw blanched (skinless) almonds create the cleanest-tasting, most delicate soup; Marcona almonds will add a very light toasty nuttiness. You can toast your own almonds if you want, but beware: Even a light toasting can overwhelm the soup with an acrid roasted flavor.\nThis recipe is traditionally made with stale bread, but my testing revealed that fresh works just as well; you can use stale bread here, but you'll want to use slightly less, about 1/3 pound (150g).\nRead More\nAndalusian Gazpacho\nEasy Gazpacho\nWatermelon Gazpacho With Calabrian-Chili Crema\nChilled Minty Carrot Soup With Dukkah Yogurt\nSoups\nSpanish\nVegan Snacks & Appetizers\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nAlmonds",
