  "full_text": "DIY Grape-Nuts Cereal Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nCook\n65 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nCooling Time\n40 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs\nServes\n14 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nVegetable oil\nor\nnon-stick cooking spray\n17 1/2\nounces\n(\n3 1/2\ncups\n)\ngraham\nor\nwhole wheat flour\n(see note)\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n1\nteaspoon\nbaking soda\n1 1/2\ncups\nbuttermilk\n1/2\ncup\nbarley malt syrup\n(at room temperature for smoother mixing)\nDirections\nHeat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with non-stick spray or oil. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add buttermilk and barley malt syrup to the bowl and mix just until all dry ingredients are evenly combined.\nSerious Eats / Molly Sheridan\nScrape batter out onto prepared sheet pan and smooth out to the edges as evenly as possible. Bake until edges are just browning and puling away from the pan, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Molly Sheridan\nLoosen cake with a spatula and flip out on a cooling rack immediately. Reduce oven to 275\u00b0F (140\u00b0C). Set aside to cool about 40 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Molly Sheridan\nWorking in 4 or 5 batches, roughly break up cake into chunks by hand and then pulse in food processor until bits reach desired size.\nSerious Eats / Molly Sheridan\nSpread cereal bits across 2 rimmed baking sheets and bake until completely dry (about 45 minutes), stirring cereal and rotating pans every 15 minutes.\nOnce dry, turn off oven, crack door, and leave to cool. Store in air-tight container.\nSerious Eats / Molly Sheridan\nSpecial Equipment\nTwo\nrimmed baking sheets\n,\nfood processor\n, cooking oil spray\nNotes\nMuch of this recipe's flavor relies on the flour you're using, so select with care. I decided to go with a coarser graham flour. Depending on what's available in your area, you could also use a more traditional whole wheat flour or supplement AP flour with appropriate proportions of wheat bran and wheat germ.\nRead More\nCrisp Homemade Granola\nBanana Granola\nCrunchy Peanut Butter Cereal Bars\nBreakfast & Brunch\nGranola",
