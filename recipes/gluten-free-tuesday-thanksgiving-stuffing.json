Divide bread cubes between 2 rimmed baking sheets. Toast until bread is golden brown and dry, about 30 minutes. Remove baking sheets from oven and allow bread to cool.\nGrease a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish and set aside. Place bread cubes in a large bowl. In a large pot, heat olive oil until shimmering. Add sausage, break apart into small bites with a fork as it cooks. Cook until no pink pieces of sausage remain, about 3 minutes. Remove the sausage from the oil using a slotted spoon. Place sausage on a plate and set aside.\nAdd celery. Cook until celery just begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Stirring frequently. Add onion. Cook for 2 minutes, continue to stir frequently. Add garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper. Cook until celery and onions are soft and aromatic. Spoon vegetables onto bread cubes. Add sausage pieces and stir.\nPour about 2 cups of broth over bread. Stir until cubes absorb broth. This takes a minute. Add an additional cup of broth. Continue to stir until broth is absorbed. If bread seems dry, add final cup of broth. (Bread cubes should be moist but not soggy. It\u2019s okay if some of the cubes fall apart. This is normal.) Transfer stuffing to prepared casserole dish.\nCover casserole dish with aluminum foil and bake in a 325\u00b0F oven until warm, about 30 minutes. Remove foil and return pan to the oven and bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes.\nSpecial Equipment\nCasserole dish\n, 2\nrimmed baking sheets\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can toast the bread cubes up to one week before making the stuffing. Make sure to allow the bread cubes to cool completely before storing them in a plastic bag.\nSides\nThanksgiving Stuffings\nSavory\nSausages",
