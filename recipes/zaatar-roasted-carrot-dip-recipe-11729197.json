On a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet, toss carrots, garlic, and za\u2019atar with 1 tablespoon of olive oil until evenly coated. Roast until tender, 30 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway through.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Hufman\nLet carrots cool slightly, about 5 minutes. In a blender, combine roasted carrots, lemon juice, tahini, salt, Aleppo pepper, and 2 tablespoons oil. Blend until a thick paste forms, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Hufman\nWith the blender running, slowly pour ice-cold water through the opening of the lid. Blend until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. If necessary, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until carrot mixture reaches desired consistency.\nSerious Eats / Hannah Hufman\nTransfer carrot mixture to a shallow serving bowl; drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, sprinkle with chopped pistachios, and garnish with additional Aleppo pepper. Serve with pita chips.\nSpecial Equipment\n13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet, blender\nNotes\nPalestinian cookbook author and Serious Eats contributor\nReem Kassis\nrecommends looking for a za'atar blend that uses actual za\u2019atar leaves instead of oregano. Both za'atar and oregeno belong to the same botanical family, but have subtle differences in flavor; she recommends the pre-made mixes from Burlap & Barrel, Maureen Abood Market, Milk Street, and Syndyanna.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dip can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.\nThe carrots can be roasted up to 3 days in advance.\nCarrots\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nDips\nSnacks & Appetizers"
