  "full_text": "Classic \u00c9clairs\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n60 mins\nCook\n60 mins\nActive\n60 mins\nCooling Time\n30 mins\nTotal\n2 hrs 30 mins\nServes\n24 servings\nMakes\n24 \u00e9clairs\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFor the \u00c9clairs:\nOne\nrecipe\nChoux Pastry\n(made with a combination of milk and water, and the optional sugar),\ntransferred to a pastry bag\nfitted with a 1/2-inch French star tip (see notes)\nOne\nrecipe\nvanilla pastry cream\n, transferred to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain round tip\nNonstick cooking spray\n, for coating \u00e9clairs\nFor the Glaze:\n4\nounces\ndark chocolate\n, about\n70%\n, chopped (3/4 cup; 115g)\n2 ounces (\n4\ntablespoons\n; 60g)\nunsalted butter\n, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n1/2 ounce (\n1\ntablespoon\n; 15g)\nlight corn syrup\n1/8\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal kosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\nDirections\nTo Make the \u00c9clair Shells:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). To prepare a template for your \u00e9clairs, take one sheet of parchment paper and, using a ruler as a guide and a permanent marker for easily visible lines, draw twelve 4 1/2-inch long lines that are 2 inches apart. Flip paper upside down and set it on an aluminum half-sheet tray. Repeat with a second piece of parchment paper and sheet tray.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPipe a small amount of choux paste under each corner of parchment paper (the dough acts as a glue and keeps the paper in place as you pipe).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPipe the first tray of \u00e9clair shells: Holding the bag at a 45\u00b0 angle, lightly drag the tip along the surface of the paper and apply steady downward pressure, while slowly piping a 1-inch wide line of choux following a single line on the template. To stop piping, cease applying pressure and move the pastry tip up and over toward the opposite end of the \u00e9clair before completely lifting away. Continue to pipe until tray is full. To smooth out the surface of any uneven \u00e9clairs, dip a finger into cold water and gently pat down any bumps. Coat \u00e9clairs evenly with cooking spray.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBake first tray until \u00e9clair shells are puffed, golden brown, and hollow feeling, about 30 minutes. While first tray of \u00e9clair shells are baking, repeat Step 3 for the second tray of \u00e9clair shells. As soon as first tray are fully baked, remove from oven and set second tray in oven to bake.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWorking quickly while first tray of \u00e9clairs are still hot, make two 1/4-inch holes on the underside of each \u00e9clair (one near each end) by gently inserting the tip of a paring knife and rotating in a circular motion, then return to tray.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAs soon as second tray of \u00e9clairs are baked, repeat Step 5. Return both trays to the turned-off but still warm oven with the door partially open for 30 minutes.\nTo Fill the \u00c9clairs:\nWorking one \u00e9clair at a time, insert tip of pastry cream\u2013filled bag into a hole in each \u00e9clair shell and begin piping with steady pressure until filled (pastry cream will start to overflow the hole). Repeat with other hole. Wipe away any excess pastry cream. Repeat until all \u00e9clairs are filled.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Make the Glaze:\nCombine chocolate, butter, corn syrup, and salt in a wide, shallow microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 15 second increments, stirring after each increment, until chocolate is melted and mixture is completely smooth, about 1 minute in total. If you don't have a microwave, see Notes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWorking one at a time, hold each \u00e9clair upside down and carefully dip the top in the glaze, then return to tray. Repeat with remaining \u00e9clairs. Allow glaze to set, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nPastry bags\nNotes\nFor the choux pastry, combine 1/2 cup (115g) milk and 1/2 cup (115g) water to get 1 cup of liquid. If you don\u2019t have milk, feel free to use 1 cup (235g) water; the \u00e9clairs will just bake up more tan in color than golden brown.\nIf you don\u2019t have a microwave, you can make the glaze in a double boiler. Place 2 1/2 cups water in a 3-quart saucier on the stove over medium heat. In a large, heat-proof bowl that will sit comfortably on the pot without toppling over or touching the water below, combine chocolate, butter, corn syrup, and salt. Stir gently until chocolate and butter are melted and the glaze is smooth and shiny.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\n\u00c9clairs are best consumed on the day they\u2019re made.\nTo store unfilled, unglazed \u00e9clairs, wrap them tightly in plastic and place in an airtight container; they can be kept frozen for up to 1 month. To refresh \u00e9clairs, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Transfer frozen \u00e9clairs to a sheet tray and reheat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Let cool at room temperature before filling and glazing.\nPastries\nFrench\nEaster Desserts\nMother's Day\nFather's Day"
