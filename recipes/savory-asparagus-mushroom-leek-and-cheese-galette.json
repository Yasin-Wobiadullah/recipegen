After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-lined aluminum rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate to relax and chill dough, at least 2 hours or up to 24.\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan or cast iron skillet, heat 4 tablespoons (60ml) olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 6 minutes.\nStir in asparagus stalks, thyme, and the remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil. Lower heat to medium and cook, tossing and stirring, until asparagus is tender, about 8 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) water to skillet, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan. Season with salt and remove from heat.\nMeanwhile, in a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat until foaming. Add leeks and cook, stirring, until very soft, about 8 minutes. Lower heat if necessary to prevent browning. Season with salt.\nAdd the leeks to the asparagus mixture along with the cheese and stir to combine.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C). Spread asparagus-leek mixture on prepared dough round, leaving about a 2-inch border of dough all around. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, each running from filling to edge of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold each segment of dough over filling, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Chill galette for 10 minutes in the refrigerator.\nIn a small bowl, drizzle reserved asparagus tips with olive oil, season with salt, and toss to coat lightly and evenly. Arrange asparagus tips on top of exposed filling in center of the galette.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nBrush egg over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together.\nBake until galette is golden brown around the edges and bubbling in the center, about 45 minutes longer. Let cool 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve warm.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge saut\u00e9 pan\n,\nlarge saucepan\n, or\nsaucier\n;\nrimmed baking sheet\n;\nparchment paper\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe galette can be held at room temperature (and served warm or at room temperature) for a few hours after making. Leftovers can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated, then reheated in a warm oven.\nRead More\nBroccoli and Cheese Galette Recipe\nSpanakopita (Greek Savory Greens Pie) Recipe\nCaramelized Onion and Goat Cheese Tartlets Recipe\nFrench Onion Soup Tarte Tatin Recipe\nZucchini Tart With Cream Cheese, Mozzarella, and Thyme\nCheese\nRecipes\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Mains\nPie Dough"
