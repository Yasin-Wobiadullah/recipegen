Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes; lower heat as necessary to prevent browning.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd cauliflower, cream and/or stock, and thyme. Cover, bring to a simmer, and cook, adjusting heat to maintain simmer, until cauliflower is tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Uncover and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by about three-quarters, about 20 minutes. Discard thyme sprig.\nUsing a blender or immersion blender, blend cauliflower and liquid to form a very smooth pur\u00e9e. Season with salt. (You can adjust pur\u00e9e consistency as needed: Thicken by cooking down further while stirring often over low heat in a wide nonstick skillet, or thin by whisking in liquid, such as stock, cream, or water.) Serve warm.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nor\nimmersion blender\nNotes\nCream makes the most luxurious pur\u00e9e, while chicken stock adds a rich depth of flavor. You can use either or combine the two to get the best of both worlds. To make this vegan, you can also use water or vegetable stock, and use oil instead of butter.\nRead More\nNutty Roasted-Cauliflower Pur\u00e9e\nButternut Squash Pur\u00e9e Recipe\nCauliflower Sabzi Recipe\nHow to Make a Vegetable Pur\u00e9e\nHow to Make Creamy Vegetable Soups Without a Recipe\nThanksgiving Side Dishes\nChristmas Sides\nGluten-free Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nStovetop Vegetables"
