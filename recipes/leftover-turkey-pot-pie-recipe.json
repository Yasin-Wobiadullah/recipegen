Add the onion, carrot, and celery, and cook until soft and golden. Sprinkle in the flour and cook for an additional minute, then whisk in the stock vigorously to avoid any lumps. Whisk in the milk and bring to a simmer, then turn the heat to low and allow to thicken, stirring often, for 10 minutes or so. Stir in the turkey and parsley, then season to taste with salt and pepper, keeping in mind that the stock might have been salty already.\nPreheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Arrange six 10-ounce ramekins (or use a smaller number of larger ones) on a baking sheet. Roll out the pie crusts on a floured surface until large enough to make rounds to cover the ramekins with a little extra around the edges. Extra dough around the edges can be balled up and rolled out again, as necessary. It should be about 1/4-inch thick.\nSpoon the filling into the ramekins and cover with the crust rounds. Tuck the edges back under, and slash the top to vent it. Beat the egg in a small bowl with a tablespoon of water, then brush it into the crust surfaces. Bake until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling, about 25 to 30 minutes.\nTurkey Mains\nSavory\nTurkey",
