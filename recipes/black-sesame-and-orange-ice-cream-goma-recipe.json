Add two to three tablespoons half-and-half and blend till smooth. Add remaining half-and-half and blend on high till well combined, about two minutes. Seeds will not be completely pulverized, which is fine. Large chunks can always be strained out.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together sugar and yolks until thickened and lighter in color. Combine yolk and dairy mixtures in a heavy-bottomed three quart saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly while custard thickens. Custard is done when it coats the back of a spoon and a swiped finger leaves a clean line.\nRemove from heat and transfer to an air-tight container for overnight chill. Stir in sesame oil, orange zest, and salt till well combined. Chill overnight, then churn the next day according to manufacturer's instructions. Serve immediately for a whipped, soft-serve consistency, or return to container to set for two to three hours for something firmer.\nSpecial Equipment\nice cream maker, blender\nIce Cream\nSesame & Tahini",
