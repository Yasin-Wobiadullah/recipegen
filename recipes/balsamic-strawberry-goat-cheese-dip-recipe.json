Place the baguette slices on a baking sheet and brush both sides lightly with olive oil. Bake until golden, about 8 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine goat cheese, cream cheese, and honey in a food processor and process until fluffy and smooth. Grease a small (1 quart) baking dish with olive oil and scrape in goat cheese mixture. Using a spoon, smooth goat cheese into an even layer; then use the spoon to create a slight indentation in the center that rises evenly towards the edges (this will help cradle the strawberries later).\nIn a small saucepan, combine balsamic vinegar and sugar over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until vinegar is slightly syrupy and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Let cool.\nPlace goat cheese dip in the oven and bake until lightly browned on top, 10-12 minutes.\nStir together strawberries, basil, and balsamic reduction in a small bowl. Spoon berries and any juices on top of the baked goat cheese dip and serve warm with the toasted baguette slices.\nSpecial equipment\nFood processor, small (1-quart) baking dish\nThis Recipe Appears In\nServe up Some Savory Sweetness With Balsamic Strawberry Goat Cheese Dip\nCheese Dips\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nSavory\nGoat Cheese\nStrawberry",
