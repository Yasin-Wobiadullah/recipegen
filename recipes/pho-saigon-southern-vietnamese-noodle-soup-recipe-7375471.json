Allow to cool, then peel the ginger and discard any heavily blackened parts and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nIn a medium cast iron or stainless steel skillet, toast cloves, star anise, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let cool, then wrap cloves, star anise, coriander\u00a0 seeds, and fennel seeds in muslin and tie off with kitchen twine.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nWash all bones, shanks, tendons, and tripe thoroughly in water. Transfer beef leg and neck bones to a stockpot and add just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high hea, then let boil vigorously for 5 minutes to release foamy impurities.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nPour off water, then rinse bones to remove any remaining impurities. Wash stockpot thoroughly.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nReturn bones to stockpot along with shank and tendons to stockpot. Add cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, spice pouch, charred onion and ginger, salt, rock sugar, and 4 1/2 quarts (4.3L) water. Bring to a boil over high heat and skim off scum. Reduce heat to low and let simmer gently, uncovered, frequently skimming any scum and fat that floats to surface, for 3 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nAdd tripe and simmer for 30 minutes. Add fish sauce and continue to simmer for 30 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nRemove shank, tendon, and tripe and shock them in a bowl filled with ice water to retain their texture. Drain and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nRemove broth from heat, then remove neck bones and bones with marrow and reserve for another use (I recommend eating it later as a snack). Let broth stand for 10 minutes to settle any sediment, then carefully strain broth through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth or muslin, being careful not to pour sediment through; you should have about 12 cups (2.8L) broth.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nReturn broth to a large clean pot, then taste and season with additional fish sauce and rock sugar to your liking. Set aside until ready to serve.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nTo Assemble and Serve:\nSlice shank, tendon, and tripe crosswise against the grain into thin slices. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nArrange Thai basil, sawtooth herbs, bean sprouts, jalape\u00f1o slices, and lime wedges on a large plate.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nPlace sliced onion, scallion, and cilantro in separate bowls.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nCook noodles according to package instructions. Strain and rinse noodles with cold water.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nFor each serving, place about 4 ounces (115g) noodles in each bowl. Top with a few pieces of sliced shank, tendon, tripe, meatballs, and raw beef round. Garnish with sliced onion, scallion, and cilantro. Ladle about 1 1/2 cups hot broth into bowls and sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. Serve immediately with garnishes.\nSerious Eats / Vy Tran\nSpecial Equipment\nFine mesh sieve, muslin cloth, kitchen twine\nNotes\nIf you plan on doubling the recipe, simmer for 8 hours.\nTo blanch the mung bean sprouts, bring a pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the bean sprouts and blanch them for 45 seconds.\nVietnamese meatballs can be found in the refrigerated section at the Asian grocery stores. Freeze leftover meatballs and defrost them in the fridge before cooking.\nIt is very difficult to slice beef so thinly at home; your best bet is to ask the butcher to do it for you, or to shop at an Asian grocer where you can find pre-sliced beef. If you do want to try slicing it yourself, freeze the beef until partially frozen (not rock-hard, but quite firm), then slice as thinly as possible with a very sharp slicing knife.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nRefrigerate unused broth and cooked meat separately in lidded containers for up to three days. To freeze unused stock, divide in portions in zipper-lock bags. Lay flat on a baking sheet to freeze. They can be frozen for up to 3 months. When ready to use, thaw them in the fridge overnight. Reheat the broth and re-season to taste.\nVietnamese\nThe Latest\nNoodles\nSoutheast Asian\nBeef",
