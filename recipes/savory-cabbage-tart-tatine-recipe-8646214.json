After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 10-inch round, 1/8-to 1/4-inch thick. (Save the other half for another use.) Transfer to a large, flat plate lined with parchment, or another similar arrangement. Working around circumference, fold 1/2 inch of dough over itself and pinch to create 9-inch round with raised rim. Cut three 2-inch slits in center of dough, and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Place sugar and 2 tablespoons (30ml) of the vinegar in a 10-inch oven-safe stainless-steel skillet; heat over low, undisturbed, swirling and tilting pan occasionally, until mixture is light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Increase heat to medium-low; swirl in butter, Dijon, thyme, salt, black pepper, and remaining 4 tablespoons (60ml) vinegar; cook, stirring often, until thick and deep golden, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from heat, pour in even layer into bottom of a 13-by 9-inch baking dish; clean and dry skillet. Place cabbage wedges in baking dish, overlapping as needed. (They won\u2019t fit in an even layer, but will shrink as they cook). Bake, gently turning wedges every 20 minutes, until very tender and golden brown, about 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nLine a baking sheet with paper towels. Using a slotted spoon or slotted fish spatula, transfer cabbage to the prepared baking sheet, arranging wedges in an even layer, and allow drain. Discard remaining liquids from baking dish. Using clean paper towels, firmly press cabbage wedges to soak up any excess moisture.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nGrease cleaned skillet with softened butter; arrange roasted cabbage wedges tightly in an even layer in rose pattern: Beginning in center of skillet, place small leaves/bits, slightly overlapping as needed; working out towards sides of pan, place cabbage wedges with narrow edge facing toward center, overlapping as needed until all wedges are used. Sprinkle evenly with Gruy\u00e8re.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nCarefully place pastry, rim side down, over cabbage, making sure it is centered and not touching skillet sides. Bake at 400\u00b0F until crust is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer skillet to wire rack set; let cool for 5 minutes. Run a sharp knife or small offset around edges to loosen; place a plate over skillet, carefully invert tarte tatin onto plate. Garnish with additional thyme; slice and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Robby Lozano\nSpecial Equipment\n13- by 9-inch baking dish\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nYou can use 1/2 (14.1 oz.) package refrigerated pie dough, at room temperature, in place of homemade pie dough or 1 sheet frozen all-butter puff pastry, thawed.\nCabbage\nThe Latest"
