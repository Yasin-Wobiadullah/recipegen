Shake vigorously for 15 seconds to blend all ingredients.\nFill shaker 2/3 full with ice. Shake again, vigorously, until egg white is frothy and drink is well-chilled, about 30 seconds.\nIf you shake the drink very well, twice, before straining, you should emulsify all the white before any of it curdles, and you can simply strain the drink into two chilled coupe glasses. If you open the shaker and see a few curdled bits of white, double-strain by pouring it out of the shaker through a standard strainer into a fine mesh or tea strainer held above the chilled glasses.\nSpecial equipment\ncocktail shaker, cocktail strainer, tea strainer (or other fine mesh strainer), coupe glasses\nThis Recipe Appears In\nCelebrate Spring With an Egg in Your Cocktail\nWhiskey\nLiqueurs & Fortified Wines"
