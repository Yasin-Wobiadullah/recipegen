Spread rice flour on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, shaking pan occasionally, until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer toasted rice flour to a small bowl; set aside.\nRezel Kealoha\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Using tongs, add oxtails and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 15 minutes. Transfer oxtails to plate; set aside.\nRezel Kealoha\nAdd half of the garlic (30g), half of the onion (58g), and scallion trimmings to Dutch oven. Cook, stirring occasionally, on medium-high heat until garlic is golden brown and onions are translucent, about 3 minutes.\nRezel Kealoha\nReturn oxtails to Dutch oven along with 4 quarts (3.8L) water. Bring to boil, cover partially with lid, and cook for 1 1/2 hours, skimming any fat and scum that accumulates on the surface. Lower heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and continue to cook until oxtails are tender, about 3 hours.\nRezel Kealoha\nAdd bok choy and cook until bottoms are translucent, about 2 minutes.\nRezel Kealoha\nUsing tongs, remove bok choy and oxtails and transfer to a large heatproof bowl; set aside. Using an immersion blender, pur\u00e9e the braising liquid in the Dutch oven (if you don\u2019t have an immersion blender, you can transfer liquid to a blender). Strain liquid through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large heatproof bowl; reserve strained liquid (you should have about 3 cups; 710ml).\nRezel Kealoha\nMeanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and increase oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). In a large mixing bowl, toss eggplant and beans with 3 tablespoons (45ml) oil and fish sauce. Spread eggplant and beans on rimmed baking sheet and roast until tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside.\nRezel Kealoha\nIn a 4-quart saucepan, heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add remaining garlic and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden brown and onions are translucent, about 3 minutes.\nRezel Kealoha\nStir in 1 cup (235ml) reserved braising liquid, peanut butter, toasted rice flour, annatto powder, and ginisang bagoong. If you want your sauce to be less viscous, stir in reserved braising liquid in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments to reach desired consistency (save remaining braising liquid for another use). (If you prefer a smooth sauce, use an immersion blender to smooth it out; if you don\u2019t have an immersion blender, you can transfer sauce to a blender).\nRezel Kealoha\nArrange oxtails, bok choy, eggplant, and beans in serving bowls. Spoon sauce on top, then garnish with scallions, peanuts, and fried garlic. Serve with rice and additional ginisang bagoong alongside.\nRezel Kealoha\nSpecial equipment\nLarge\nDutch oven\n, immersion blender, 4-quart saucepan.\nNotes\nIf you want to substitute tripe for oxtails, I recommend using book tripe, not honeycomb tripe; book tripe has a softer yet chewy texture that I prefer. Most tripe is bleached, so before you cook it, rinse it under cold running water.\u00a0 Once clean, boil the tripe in salted water for 10 minutes. Using tongs, remove the tripe from the water (discard the water) and rinse the tripe under cold running water. In Step 4, add tripe to the Dutch oven and simmer until tripe is tender with a slight chewy bite, between 1 to 2 hours. Proceed with the recipe as directed.\nAvoid using commercial-style peanut butter, which has added sugar, because it will add a noticeable sweetness that doesn't fit the flavor profile of the dish.\nGinisang bagoong is fermented shrimp paste that has been saut\u00e9ed with onion, garlic, vinegar, and sugar. It can be found in Filipino or Asian specialty markets and online.\nIf you have a pressure cooker or electric multicooker (such as an Instant Pot), you can sear the oxtails and then saut\u00e9 the garlic, onions, and scallions trimmings in it instead of a Dutch oven; then return oxtails to the cooker and fill with water to the max-fill line. Cook at high pressure for 1 hour and 15 mins.\u00a0 Proceed with the recipe as directed. This process saves you time, but you\u2019re sacrificing the amount of broth you can keep for future use.\nMake-ahead and Storage\nLeftover braising liquid can be frozen in an airtight container for up to 1 month.\nThe sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month.\nFilipino\nStovetop Beef\nBeef Mains\nThe Latest"
