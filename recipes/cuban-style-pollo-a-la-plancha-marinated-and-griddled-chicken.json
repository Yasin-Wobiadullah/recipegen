(Alternatively, to make with a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic with the salt to form a paste, then mix in the rest of the ingredients. Alternatively, finely grate or mince the garlic and stir together with the remaining ingredients in a small bowl.)\nSerious Eats / Aaron Hutcherson\nIf using chicken breast halves, cut into cutlets following\nour instructions here\n, pounding to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch. (If desired, you can butterfly the breast halves by not fully cutting all the way through, so that they open like a book; butterflied breasts also need to be pounded to an even thickness.)\nSerious Eats / Aaron Hutcherson\nPlace chicken cutlets in a large zipper-lock bag or shallow baking or glass storage dish. Add marinade, making sure it coats chicken evenly all over. Press out excess air and seal zipper-lock bag, or cover dish with plastic or a lid. Refrigerate for 30 minutes; if chicken is in a dish, turn it once halfway through.\nSerious Eats / Aaron Hutcherson\nRemove the chicken breasts from the marinade and wipe off any excess. In a stainless steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, if necessary, to prevent crowding the pan, add the chicken cutlets and cook until golden brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer cooked cutlets to a platter and cover with foil or place in a low oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining chicken, adding more oil if the pan gets too dry.\nSerious Eats / Aaron Hutcherson\nIn the same skillet that you cooked the chicken, add more oil if the pan is dry and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion rings, season with salt, and saut\u00e9 until the onions have softened a bit and started to brown, 7 to 10 minutes; lower heat and/or add a small splash of water if the contents of the pan threaten to burn.\nSerious Eats / Aaron Hutcherson\nArrange cutlets on serving plates and top with browned onions. Serve with black beans and rice and garnish with cilantro leaves and lime wedges.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n,\nfood processor\n, or\nmortar and pestle\n;\nmeat pounder\n;\nstainless steel skillet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe marinade can be blended in advance and refrigerated for up to 5 hours before using. However, it is best not to marinate the chicken for much longer than the recommended 30 minutes.\nRead More\nPalomilla (Cuban Steak and Onions)\nCuban-Style Roast Pork Shoulder With Mojo\nMojo Sauce Recipe\nCuban\nRecipes by World Cuisine\nChicken Breast\nStovetop Chicken\nChicken Mains"
