Whisk in flour, followed by milk or water, until a thick and slightly lumpy batter begins to form. (Exactly how thick varies from cook to cook, but a general goal is a batter that\u2019s thicker than pancake batter, spreadable, but not free-flowing.) If needed, add additional liquid, 1 tablespoon at a time, to achieve the desired texture.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nIn a large saut\u00e9 or frying pan or nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, carefully add a 1-ounce spoonfuls (about 2 tablespoons) of banana batter to oil, making sure to release them close to oil to prevent splashing. Fry until golden on first side, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Flip and fry until golden on second side side, 45 seconds to 1 minute longer. Transfer to paper towels to drain, and repeat with remaining batter, adding oil as needed if pan is dry and adjusting heat to prevent over browning.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nIn a small bowl, stir sugar and cinnamon to combine. Transfer fritters to a serving dish and sprinkle cinnamon-sugar and salt to taste all over hot fritters. Serve hot or at room temperature as a side dish with a meal or as a quick and tasty snack.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon.
