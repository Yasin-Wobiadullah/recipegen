(The water should feel as warm as a hot bath or Jacuzzi\u2014not lukewarm but not boiling, either.)\nTransfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. The dough should feel smooth and satiny.\nSpritz a large, clean bowl with cooking spray or grease lightly with vegetable oil. Place the dough ball in the bowl and cover with a spritzed or greased piece of plastic wrap. Let rise for 1 hour, until doubled in size.\nLine 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nTransfer the dough to a clean, unfloured surface and divide into 24 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 9 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. Line up the ropes on the baking sheets and cover loosely with spritzed or greased plastic wrap. Let rise for another 30 minutes.\nFor the Poaching Liquid:\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and prepare the poaching liquid. Bring 8 cups of water to a simmer in a large, wide saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add baked soda and brown sugar and stir until dissolved. The water will foam slightly.\nGently drop the dough ropes into the simmering water, a few at a time, and poach for 15 seconds. Remove the ropes gently using tongs, a slotted spoon, or a metal skimmer and return them to the baking sheets.\nFor the Topping:\nWhisk together egg and water to form egg wash. Brush ropes with egg wash and sprinkle with pretzel salt or sea salt. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until fully hardened, dark brown, and glossy, checking every few minutes after 30 minutes; switch the sheets between top and bottom racks halfway through. Transfer the baked pretzels to a wire rack and let cool completely before serving. Store the pretzels at room temperature in an airtight container for up to a week.\nHors D'Oeuvres\nVegetarian Snacks & Appetizers\nBread\nSuper Bowl",
