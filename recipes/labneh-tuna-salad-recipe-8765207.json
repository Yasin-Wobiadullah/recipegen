Spoon tuna salad onto slices of bread and top with lettuce leaves if desired, then close the sandwiches.

You\u2019ll want to use a thick product that doesn\u2019t separate. Baraka is one good brand.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer, citrus juicer\nMake Ahead and Storage\nTuna salad is best consumed within a day of preparation, but it can safely be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\nTuna\nThe Latest"
