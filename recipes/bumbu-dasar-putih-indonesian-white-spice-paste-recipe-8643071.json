  "full_text": "Bumbu Dasar Putih (Indonesian White Spice Paste)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nCooling Time\n60 mins\nTotal\n85 mins\nServes\n1 1/2 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n10\nwhole\ncandlenuts\nor unsalted macadamias (\n1\nounce\n;\n30\ng\n), crushed\n1\ntablespoon\ncoriander seeds or\nground coriander\n16\nsmall\nAsian\nshallots\n(about\n8\nounces\n;\n226\ng\n), coarsely chopped\n8\nmedium\ncloves garlic\n(about\n1 1/2\nounces\n;\n40\ng\n), peeled and smashed\n1/2\nteaspoon\nDiamond Crystal\nkosher salt\n; for table salt, use half as much by volume\n1\nteaspoon\nground\nwhite pepper\n1/3\ncup\n(\n80\nml\n)\nvegetable oil\nDirections\nIn a small stainless-steel skillet, toast candlenuts over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and aromatic, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer toasted nuts to a small bowl and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nAdd coriander seeds to the now-empty skillet and toast over medium heat until lightly browned and fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind coriander into a coarse powder. (If using ground coriander skip this step and proceed with step 3.)\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nIn a small 3- or 4-cup food processor or blender, process toasted candlenuts, ground coriander, shallots, garlic, salt, pepper, and oil, stopping and scraping down sides as needed, until thick paste forms, about 1 minute. (Spice paste should have the texture of cooked oatmeal; if it is too thick, add oil or water, 1 tablespoon at a time until thick and creamy.)\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nIn a wok or medium nonstick skillet, add the spice paste and fry over medium heat, stirring continuously until it is aromatic and deepens in color and the paste separates from the oil, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat as needed if the paste is browning too fast to avoid burning.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nTransfer to a heat-proof bowl and let cool completely before transferring to an airtight glass container (see notes.) Seal tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.\nSerious Eats / Melati Citrawireja\nSpecial Equipment\nMortar and pestle or spice grinder, 3- or 4-cup\u00a0 food processor, flexible spatula, wok or nonstick skillet, glass container\nNotes\nMildly toxic when raw, candlenut (kemiri) is used as a thickener in Indonesian cooking. In Hawaii, it is known as kukui nut and is a common ingredient in poke. You can find candlenuts at some Asian grocery stores (especially those specializing in Southeast Asian cuisines) and online. Macadamias have a similarly high oil content and texture when pounded and are a good substitute.\nThis recipe can be easily halved or doubled.\nTo prevent the aroma of the spice paste from permeating the fridge, store the paste in a container that can be tightly sealed. I recommend using glass, as plastic can take on the smell of the spice paste. Wrap the container with plastic wrap if needed.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBumbu dasar putih can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to two weeks or or frozen for up to 3 months.\nTo freeze the spice paste, spoon spice paste into ice cube trays and freeze until solid, about 4 hours. Remove frozen cubes and transfer to a zip-top bag or airtight container, then keep frozen to use as needed.\nSoutheast Asian\nThe Latest\nVegetarian\nCondiments & Sauces\nVegan",
