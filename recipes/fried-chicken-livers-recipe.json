Combine the buttermilk and 1 tablespoon of hot sauce in a medium bowl, then add the trimmed chicken livers. Marinate the chicken livers in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.\nDrain the chicken livers in a fine-mesh sieve. Place the flour, eggs, and Panko into three separate medium bowls or shallow dishes. Dredge each liver in the flour, then in the egg, and finally in the panko. Place the breaded livers on a rimmed baking sheet or plate.\nPour enough oil into a large heavy skillet to reach a depth of 1 inch. Heat the oil over moderately high heat until it reaches a temperature of 350\u00b0F on a deep-fry or instant read thermometer. Working in batches, place breaded livers in the hot oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden and crisp, 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer the livers to a large platter lined with paper towels and season with salt. Serve the livers with additional hot sauce on the side.\nFried Chicken\nChicken\nSides\nSnacks & Appetizers",
