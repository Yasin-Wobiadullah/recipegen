Add sausages and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer sausages to a plate and set aside.\nAdd cumin seeds to the pan and cook, swirling and stirring constantly until cumin is aromatic and lightly golden, about 30 seconds. Add onion and a generous pinch of salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not brown, about 10 minutes.\nAdd garlic and red pepper flakes and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Stir in lentils, tomatoes, chicken stock, and a healthy pinch of salt. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium-high and simmer lentils, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until lentils are mostly tender and cooking liquid has reduced to a stew-like consistency, about 20 minutes.\nStir in dandelion greens and cook until lightly wilted, about 1 minute. Return sausages to the skillet, nestling them into the lentils so that they are mostly submerged. Cover the pan, and cook until sausages register an internal temperature of 150\u00b0F (65.5\u00b0C), 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in sherry vinegar, and season to taste with salt. Portion into individual serving bowls, and sprinkle with cilantro leaves. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nStraight-sided saut\u00e9 pan or\nDutch oven\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis dish can be made in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
