Drain well.\nMeanwhile, in a large Dutch oven or similarly sized pot, combine chicken, whole garlic cloves, ginger, and scallion whites with 2 quarts (2L) cold water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook at a gentle simmer until thickest part of breast close to bone registers 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer and joint between thighs and body registers at least 175\u00b0F (80\u00b0C), about 45 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCarefully transfer chicken to work surface and let stand until cool enough to handle. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium heatproof bowl and strain broth through it; discard solids.\nIn a 3-quart saucier or saucepan, heat sesame oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add drained rice and cook, stirring frequently, until a sticky film develops on bottom of pot, about 3 minutes. Add carrot, onion, and zucchini and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables have softened slightly and rice grains are slightly translucent around their edges, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd 6 cups (1.4L) strained broth and stir to scrape up any starchy coating on bottom of pan. Bring to a rapid simmer, then cook, stirring occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to bottom of pan, until rice grains are plump and tender and liquid is thickened, about 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, shred chicken meat, discarding skin and bones.\nAdd two-thirds of both the chicken meat and scallion greens to juk along with remaining 2 cloves minced garlic and simmer until chicken is warmed through; if juk is thicker than you'd like, thin as desired with remaining broth (or reserve extra broth for another use). Season juk with salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLadle juk into individual serving bowls, garnish with remaining shredded chicken and scallion greens, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\n3-quart saucier\n,\nfine-mesh strainer\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe juk can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat on the stovetop, adding a little water or chicken broth if necessary to adjust consistency.\nRead More\nSamgyetang (Korean Rice-Stuffed Chicken Soup)\nKorean\nWhole Chicken\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nWhite Rice\nChicken Mains",
