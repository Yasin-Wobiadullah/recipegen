Line a large bowl with paper towels and have ready. Working in four batches, remove potato chips from water and spin dry in a salad spinner. Add to oil one chip at a time, working quickly, until all chips are in the oil. Temperature will drop. Adjust heat to maintain temperature between 275 and 300\u00b0F (chips should bubble vigorously). Cook, agitating and flipping chips occasionally with a large metal spider until bubbles reduce to a faint trickle, removing chips as they finish cooking and transferring to the paper towel-lined bowl. Sprinkle each batch with 1/4 of seasoning mixture while still hot, tossing to coat, and transfer to a large bowl to cool. Repeat until all chips are cooked and coated.\nChips can be served immediately or allowed to cool and stored in sealed zipper-lock bags or containers at room temperature for up to 1 week.\nSpecial equipment\nMandoline-style slicer and a deep fryer, wok, or a Dutch oven\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Food Lab: How to Make Stuffing-Flavored Potato Chips\nSnacks & Appetizers\nAmerican\nFrying\nRusset Potatoes\nQuick Snacks"
