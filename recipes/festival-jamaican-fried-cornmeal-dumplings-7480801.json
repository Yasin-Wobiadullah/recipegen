Working with one dough piece at a time, roll each dough piece into the shape of a long, fat cigar (about 6 to 8 inches long), dusting surfaces and hands with flour as needed.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nSet an oven to keep warm or its lowest setting. In a large Dutch oven or flat-bottomed wok, heat oil over medium-high heat until it registers 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Working in batches of about 3 at a time to avoid crowding oil, fry dough cigars until golden on first side, about 2 minutes. Turn festival and fry until second side is golden, about 2 minutes longer.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nTransfer to a paper-towel-lined platter; transfer platter to oven to keep festival warm. Repeat with remaining dough cigars. Serve festival with jerk pork, pan chicken, fried fish, and other savory dishes.\nSerious Eats / Karina Matalon\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge Dutch oven or flat-bottomed wok\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe dough can be refrigerated wrapped in plastic wrap after Step 2 for up to 24 hours.\nJamaican\nThe Latest\nSides\nSnacks & Appetizers\nCaribbean"
