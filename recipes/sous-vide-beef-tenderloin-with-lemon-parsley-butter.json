Place each portion cut-side down on the cutting board and flatten gently with your hand to an approximate two-inch thickness. Season generously with salt and pepper, then place in vacuum bag with thyme sprigs. Seal bag, and place in water oven preheated to 130\u00b0F for medium rare, or 140\u00b0F for medium. Cook for at least 45 minutes, and up to 4 hours.\nMeanwhile, combine 6 tablespoons of butter, parsley, garlic, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small bowl and beat with a fork until homogeneous. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nWhen ready to cook steaks, remove from bags, and dry carefully on paper towels. Melt remaining tablespoon butter and oil in a heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over high heat until butter is browned and beginning to smoke lightly. Add steaks and cook until well-browned on first side, about 1 minute. Flip steaks and brown on second side, about 1-minute longer. Transfer steaks to paper towel-lined plate, tent loosely with foil, and allow to rest at least 1 minute, and up to 5 minutes. Top each steak with a dollop of parsley butter and serve.\nSpecial equipment\nvacuum sealer, water oven\nThis Recipe Appears In\nWe Test the $199 Sous Vide Circulator From Anova\nSous Vide Beef\nTenderloin Steak\nBeef Mains"
