  "full_text": "Extra-Rampy Ramp Risotto\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nTotal\n30 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1/2\ncup\nfresh\nricotta cheese\n, preferably\nhomemade\n2\ntablespoons chopped\nfresh\u00a0chives\n1\ntablespoon chopped\nfresh parsley leaves\nKosher salt\nand freshly ground black pepper\n24\nramps\n, rinsed and trimmed\n6\ntablespoons\nunsalted butter\n2\ntablespoons\nextra-virgin olive oil\n1\ncup\ndry white wine\n5\ncups\nvegetable stock\nor water, divided\n1 1/2\ncups\n(about 13 1/2 ounces)\nrisotto-style rice\n(see note)\n2\nounces\nfinely\ngrated parmesan cheese\n(about 1 cup)\n1 teaspoon grated zest and\n1\nteaspoon\njuice from 1 lemon\nDirections\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, combine ricotta with half of chives and half of parsley in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nSet aside 8 ramps. Divide remaining ramps into whites and greens. Thinly slice whites and set aside. Blanch greens in boiling water until bright green, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a fine mesh strainer and run under cold water until completely chilled. Transfer to a blender. Blend on high speed, adding water as necessary, until a smooth, bright green puree is formed. Set aside.\nHeat 4 tablespoons butter and olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add chopped ramp whites and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring and tossing frequently until all liquid is evaporated, fat is bubbling, and rice has begun to take on a pale golden blond color and nutty aroma, about 3 minutes.\nAdd wine and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until mostly absorbed. Add half of stock and cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly absorbed. Add 2 more cups stock, 1 cup at a time, stirring until mostly absorbed after each addition, until rice is nearly done but still slightly chalky in center. Remove from heat and set aside.\nHeat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add reserved ramps and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and tender. Transfer to a large plate.\nReturn risotto to heat and add remaining half cup stock, parmesan cheese, lemon zest and juice, and ramp green puree. Cook, stirring constantly, until rice is cooked through and risotto is very creamy and loose. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in remaining parsley and chives.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nServe risotto in warm bowls, topped with saut\u00e9ed ramps and herb ricotta. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nI prefer using Carnaroli rice for its slightly longer grains and firmer texture. Feel free to use any risotto-style rice like Arborio or Vailone Nano.\nGluten-free Mains\nVegetarian Mains\nStovetop\nRicotta\nWhite Rice",
