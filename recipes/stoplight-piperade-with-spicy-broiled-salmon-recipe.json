Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat all the way down, cover, and cook slowly for 2 hours, stirring every half hour or so.\nAdjust a rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Remove lid from piperade pot, increase heat to high, and let it boil until the pan is nearly dry and the tomato broth has evaporated. Transfer the piperade to a food processor, and pulse until roughly chopped, about 6 one-second pulses.\nTransfer the piperade to a broiler-safe baking dish. Rub the salmon fillets with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, and season with salt and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon piment d\u2019Espelette. Place the salmon on the piperade, and broil for 10 minutes, until the top is golden brown, and the salmon is cooked through. Tear some mint over the salmon.
