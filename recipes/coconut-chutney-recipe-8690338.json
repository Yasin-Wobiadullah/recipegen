Once dal is lightly toasted, add mustard seeds and asafetida and fry until seeds begin to pop. Pour entire mixture over chutney and serve immediately. The chutney will keep for 2 to 3 days in the refrigerator (see note).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nThis chutney has a short shelf life and must be consumed within 2 to 3 days of preparing. If you need a smaller batch, the recipe can be halved or quartered and blended in a\nspice grinder\nor with a\nmortar and pestle\ninstead.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\n, small\nskillet\nRead More\nDosa (Indian Rice-and-Lentil Crepes) Recipe\nSteamed Indian Lentil and Rice Cakes (Idlis) Recipe\nMint Chutney Recipe\nSpiced Tamarind Chutney Recipe\nHow to Make Tadka\nLentils\nCondiments & Sauces\nCoconut",
