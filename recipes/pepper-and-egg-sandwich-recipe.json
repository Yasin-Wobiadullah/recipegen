Reduce heat to medium low, and let the pan cool down for 1 minute.\nWhile the pan is cooling, crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk until combined. Stir in the cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper.\nAdd garlic to skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the eggs and let cook for 10 seconds before stirring.
