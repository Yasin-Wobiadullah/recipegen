In a medium or large pot of salted boiling water, cook greens until tender, 1 to 2 minutes depending on type. Immediately transfer to prepared ice bath to cool.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring mirin and soy sauce to a simmer over medium-high heat, then remove from heat. Combine soy mixture with 3/4 cup (175ml) dashi. Taste, then add more of remaining dashi if a more dilute flavor is desired. Let cool completely.\nDrain greens. Using your hands, wring out as much water from greens as possible, then transfer to a container, pour dashi marinade on top, and toss to coat. Refrigerate, covered, for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nArrange greens on a single serving plate or several individual ones; they are often arranged in a neat line, or compressed into a cylinder shape, though loosely mounding them also works. Drizzle some of the dashi marinade on top, then garnish with bonito flakes or sesame seeds. Serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nNotes\nMany kinds of leafy greens can work here, but make sure to avoid baby spinach, which becomes far too soft and squishy when cooked.\nRead More\nWhy You Should Keep Instant Dashi in Your Pantry\nSaut\u00e9ed Japanese (Hakurei) Turnips with Turnip Greens\nVegetable Sides\nJapanese\nStovetop Vegetables\nGreens"
