Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Working with one pumpkin at a time, use a sharp paring knife to cut the top of the pumpkin off in one piece (as when making a jack-o'-lantern). Carefully run knife along the cavity of the pumpkin to loosen seeds and stringy pulp, then use a spoon to scoop them out and scrape the cavity clean. Using the paring knife, scrape seeds and pulp from the tops as well. Discard seeds and pulp or reserve for another use (try\nroasting the seeds with one of our seasoning combinations\nfor a snack). Repeat with remaining pumpkins.\nPlace kabocha squash halves cut side up on a work surface along with pumpkins. Lightly drizzle the cut and inner surfaces of kabocha squash, pumpkins, and pumpkin tops with olive oil, rubbing them with your hands to evenly coat. Season heavily with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPlace pumpkin tops on pumpkins, then set pumpkins on prepared baking sheet. Set kabocha squash, cut side down, on the same baking sheet. Roast until kabocha squash is tender and can easily be pierced with a paring knife, and sugar pumpkins have slightly softened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Lift pumpkin tops from pumpkins to allow steam to escape and set all roasted squash aside to cool on baking sheet.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nOnce the kabocha squash is cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop the flesh into a medium bowl and roughly mash with the back of the spoon. Discard squash skin. Season mashed squash with salt and pepper and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMeanwhile, Make the Mushroom Filling:\nIn a large 12-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are well browned, about 10 minutes. Push mushrooms to outer edge of skillet, add kale to now-empty center of skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until kale is slightly wilted and softened and has mixed with mushrooms, about 3 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPush mushrooms and kale to outer edge of skillet and add butter to center of skillet. Once butter has melted and begun foaming, add shallots, garlic, and thyme to center of skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sherry and sherry vinegar and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and transfer mixture to a heatproof medium bowl to cool.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMake the Spiced Cream:\nAfter squashes have cooled and kabocha is mashed, whisk together cream, milk, cinnamon, paprika, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a large\nliquid measuring cup\n. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nMake the Glaze (Optional):\nWhisk ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside.\nTo Stuff and Finish Pumpkins:\nStuff pumpkins by evenly dividing and layering half the ingredients in the following order: mashed kabocha squash, bread, mushroom-kale mixture, pepitas, pecans, Gruy\u00e8re, and spiced cream. Gently press mixture down with your hands, then repeat layering process with remaining half of stuffing ingredients. If glazing the pumpkins, use a pastry brush to paint glaze onto pumpkins and pumpkin tops.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRoast pumpkins on baking sheet, without tops, until top layer of cheese is melted and lightly browned, and pumpkins are tender and easily pierced by a paring knife, 30 to 45 minutes. Set tops on pumpkins and continue roasting for 10 minutes longer. Remove pumpkins from oven and cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Using a large spatula, carefully transfer pumpkins to a serving platter. Serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\n,\nlarge stainless steel skillet\nor\ncast iron skillet\n, pastry brush (optional)\nNotes\nRemove the stems of hard-stemmed mushrooms, like shiitakes, before using; tender-stemmed mushrooms, like oyster, can be used with the stem on.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe recipe can be fully completed in advance; leave the cooled stuffed pumpkins on the baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate for up to 2 days. To reheat, remove pumpkins from refrigerator, allow to come to room temperature, and reheat in a 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) oven until warmed through.\nRead More\n9 Roasted Pumpkin Seed Recipes\nA Guide to Winter Squash\nVegetable Wellington\nPumpkin\nRoasted Vegetables\nKale\nShiitake Mushroom\nFall Sides"
