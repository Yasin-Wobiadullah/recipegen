In large bowl, combine granulated sugar, melted chocolate, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract. Whisk together until combined. Switch to a wooden spoon and stir in dry ingredients. Stir until thick batter forms.\nChill dough for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove dough from the refrigerator. Stir in peanut butter chips. Dough will be firm.\nWorking in 2 batches, scoop batter using a cookie scoop (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) and drop dough onto 1 of the prepared baking sheets, spacing dough about 2 inches apart. Bake until cookies are set, about 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool slightly on baking sheets for 10 minutes (cookies will flatten as they cool). Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough and unused prepared baking sheet. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nGluten-Free 2 Ways: Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cookies\nCookies\nGluten-free Desserts\nPeanut Butter"
