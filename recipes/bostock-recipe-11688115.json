Add almond flour to a parchment-lined 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet and spread into a thin, even layer. Toast in oven, stirring every 3 minutes, until the almond flour is fragrant and light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, sugar, and orange zest, if using, on low speed to roughly incorporate. Increase to medium-high speed and beat until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes, pausing to scrape down bowl and beater with a flexible spatula as needed. Add almond flour, all-purpose flour, egg, brandy (if using), almond extract, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix on medium-high speed until smooth, thick, and creamy, pausing to scrape down bowl and beater halfway through, about 2 minutes. Using a flexible spatula, scrape bowl and beater to ensure that no streaks of unmixed butter remain. (Almond cream can also be prepared in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer.)\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nArrange brioche slices on a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment. In a small bowl, whisk orange juice and vanilla extract to combine. Brush both sides of 1 slice of brioche with orange juice mixture. Using an offset spatula, spread 1 tablespoon orange marmalade evenly across brioche. Top with about 3 tablespoons almond cream, spreading evenly from side to side to cover bread. Garnish with sliced almonds. Repeat with remaining brioche slices.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nBake until almond cream is a light golden brown and just firm to the touch, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature and dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar, if desired.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n13- by 18-inch rimmed\nbaking sheet\n,\nstand mixer\nor hand mixer, pastry brush, offset spatula\nNotes\nAlmond cream can be found in specialty grocery stores and online.\nBlanched almond flour is a solid beige color whereas natural almond flour appears speckled. Either variety will work well in this recipe; it all comes down to personal preference.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nAlmond cream can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.\nBostock is best eaten on the day it\u2019s made, but cooled leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Leftover bostock may become soggy; to refresh, reheat in a 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) oven until warmed through.\nBreakfast & Brunch\nThe Latest\nFrench"
