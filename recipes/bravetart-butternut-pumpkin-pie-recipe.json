Split the squash lengthways, remove seeds, and place cut-side down on a foil-lined aluminum baking sheet. Roast until fork-tender, about 45 minutes. When cool enough to handle, scrape pulp into a food processor and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Measure out 14 ounces (about 1 3/4 cups; 395g) squash pur\u00e9e. Use warm, or refrigerate in an airtight container up to a week in advance.\nFor the Custard:\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). In a medium bowl, combine butternut squash pur\u00e9e, homemade condensed milk, brown sugar, vanilla or bourbon, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, cloves, butter, and eggs. Whisk until well combined, then pour into the prepared crust. Alternatively, the prepared custard can be refrigerated for up to a week before use.\nTo Bake:\nPlace on a half sheet pan and bake about 25 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and continue baking until the filling is firm around the edges but still wobbly in the very center, about 25 minutes more, or to an internal temperature of 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C).\nCool at room temperature until the custard has set, about 2 hours, and cut with a chef's knife to serve. If you like, serve with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkling of grated nutmeg. Wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep 4 days at room temperature, or 10 days in the fridge.\nSpecial Equipment\nHalf sheet pan\n,\nfood processor\n, 9-inch pie pan (preferably glass)\nNotes\nDue to its high yield, butternut squash is my favorite option for pie, but so long as the total weight of pur\u00e9e remains the same, feel free to make use of alternatives like kabocha, buttercup, and acorn squash instead.\nRead More\nButtery, Flaky Pie Crust\nSweetened Condensed Milk\nHow to Blind Bake Pie Crust Without Weights\nPies\nThanksgiving Desserts\nButternut Squash\nPumpkin\nWinter Desserts"
