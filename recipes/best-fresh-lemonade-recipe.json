Halve and juice; pour juice into a sealable container and refrigerate. Cut rinds into 1-inch chunks. Toss with sugar in a large nonreactive mixing bowl, cover tightly with plastic, and let stand at room temperature, stirring once every 45 minutes or so, until sugar has completely dissolved, about 3 hours. (You can let the mixture stand up to 12 hours, if desired.)\nAdd water and 8 ounces (1 cup) of reserved lemon juice (see note). Stir well, then strain through a nonreactive fine-mesh strainer or piece of cheesecloth into a glass or ceramic container. At this point, the concentrated lemonade can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.\nWhen ready to serve, pour lemonade over ice and adjust to taste with additional water or lemon juice, depending on personal preference; bear in mind, though, that the lemonade will be diluted as the ice melts. (You will likely have some fresh lemon juice left over, which can be reserved for another use, though exactly how much you have will depend on how much you added to adjust the lemonade.)\nSpecial equipment\nCheesecloth or nonreactive fine-mesh strainer, 2-quart pitcher\nNotes\nIf you like, some or all of the lemons can be zested beforehand and reserved for another baking project.\nLemon Meltaways\n, perhaps? Leftover juice can be used to make\nLemon Bars\nas well. We prefer a tart lemonade, made by adding 8 ounces (1 cup) of reserved lemon juice to the lemon rind syrup. If you prefer your lemonade sweeter, start with 6 ounces and taste before adding more.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make the Best Arnold Palmer Ever\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nLemon\nSummer Drinks",
