In a pot of salted boiling water, blanch cilantro and mint until they turn bright green, about 20 seconds. Shock herbs in ice bath to stop the cooking, then drain well. Squeeze out any excess liquid from herbs.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nRemove and discard the thick mint stems, then roughly chop herbs and remaining tender stems. In a blender, pur\u00e9e blanched herbs with lime juice, serrano pepper, and just enough cold water to bring the mixture together, taking care not to over-blend and heat up the chutney, which can lead to discoloration. Season with salt to taste. The chutney will stay fresh in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Assemble:\nOn a large serving plate, spread papris in a single even layer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a small bowl, toss potatoes and chickpeas with chaat masala to taste. Spread potatoes and chickpeas all over papris.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a small bowl, combine yogurt with chaat masala to taste and spoon over potatoes, chickpeas, and papris.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTop with diced onion, mint and tamarind chutneys, and sev. Sprinkle more chaat masala on top and serve right away, preferably with sweet, milky black tea.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nKashmiri red chili powder is mild and fruity. If you cannot find it and wish to substitute cayenne pepper, be sure to cut the amount used in the recipe by half. While this recipe gives instructions for making all components from scratch, you can save time by buying some of the components premade. The papris and chutneys can be found at many Indian grocery stores, and the chutneys can be found online. Mix and match store-bought and from-scratch components for your own semi-homemade version.\nRead More\nPapris (Crispy Indian Wheat Chips)\nSpiced Tamarind Chutney\nSev (Crunchy Fried Chickpea Noodles)\nChaat-Spiced Chex Mix\nChaat Masala (Indian Street Snack Spice Blend)\nSnacks & Appetizers\nRecipes By Ingredients\nIndian\nChickpeas\nRusset Potatoes",
