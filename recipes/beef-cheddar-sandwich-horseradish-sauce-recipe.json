Place roast beef slices in a heatproof dish, cover with aluminum foil, set on the bottom rack, and cook until warmed through, about 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wrap buns in aluminum foil, set on top rack, and cook until warmed, about 5 minutes.\nFor the Horseradish Sauce\n: Add sour cream, horseradish, chives, and lemon juice to a medium-sized bowl. Stir until combined. Season with salt and pepper.\nSmear the cut-side of the bun bottoms with horseradish sauce, and top each with 1/4-pound of the sliced meat. Drizzle with some of the cheddar sauce and then crown with top bun halves. Serve immediately.\nSandwiches\nRoasted Beef\nBeef\nCheddar Cheese",
