Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nIn large bowl, whisk butter with brown sugar, \u00bd cup granulated sugar, and salt until combined. Whisk in egg, vanilla, and molasses.\nIn medium bowl, whisk flour with cocoa and baking soda. Whisk into wet mixture until just combined. Chill until firm, about 10 to 20 minutes. Place remaining \u00bd cup sugar in bowl.\nUsing scoop or \u00bc\u00a0cup measure, portion dough into balls and roll in sugar. Space evenly on pans and gently press dough balls to about \u00be inch thickness. Bake just until puffed and beginning to crack, 7 to 8 minutes, rotating pans from top to bottom and front to back halfway through baking.\nImmediately after removing from oven, give pans a hard tap and gently press center of each cookie to deflate (see note). Let cookies cool on pan 2 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.\nNotes\nTo get a soft chewy cookie, slightly underbake the cookies. Giving the pan a hard tap and pressing on the cookies after baking will help to keep the centers dense and chewy.\nCookies\nBaking\nChocolate\nChristmas Cookies"
