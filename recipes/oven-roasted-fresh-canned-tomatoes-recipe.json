Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange tomatoes on prepared baking sheet in one layer, season with salt, and drizzle all over with olive oil. Scatter herbs on top, if using. Transfer to oven and cook until excess juices have evaporated and tomatoes look slightly dry on the exterior but still moist within, 1 to 2 hours. Discard herbs, if necessary.\nSpecial equipment\nRimmed baking sheet\nNotes\nCanned tomatoes will be more intensely flavored after oven-roasting because they tend to be picked riper than out-of-season fresh tomatoes, but they'll also come out softer because the canning process precooks them. Oven-roasted fresh tomatoes hold their shape better, making them especially good if you want to keep them in larger pieces; you can choose to keep the skins and seeds intact in the fresh ones to produce a juicier roasted result, which is useful if you're leaving them whole.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nWant More Flavor From Fresh or Canned Tomatoes?
