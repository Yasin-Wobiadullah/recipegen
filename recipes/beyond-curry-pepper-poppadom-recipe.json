Add half of water and work into mixture with hands. Gradually add more water until the dough just holds together. Gradually add 1 tablespoon of the oil and knead into a very stiff dough. Cover and set aside for at least 2 hours.\nRemove from bowl and knead with greased hands until it is very pliable, about 5 minutes. Using a tablespoon measure, divide into 12 to 15 small balls. Roll each ball into very thin rounds with a rolling pin on a lightly oiled surface. The rounds should be evenly thin and about 6 inches in diameter.\nSpace the dough rounds on rimmed baking sheets and dry in direct sunlight until totally dry, 24 to 48 hours. Alternatively, dry in the oven at the lowest possible heat for 4 to 6 hours, or in a dehydrator. After fully drying store papads in an airtight container.\nTo fry the papads:\nIn a cast iron skillet or medium pot, heat 1/2 inch of oil over medium-high heat until an instant-read thermometer registers 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Working 1 papad at a time, gently lower into oil and fry, turning once and pressing down with tongs to submerge as it cooks, until papad is crisped and bubbly, 15 to 30 seconds. Drain on a paper-towel\u2013lined tray, then serve immediately.\nTo bake/broil the papads:\nHeat papads directly over an open flame or gas grill until lightly toasted, or preheat broiler to high and broil until lightly toasted. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nRolling pin\nNotes\nBlack gram flour and asafoetida can be found online and in Indian specialty markets.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nStore the dry papads in an airtight container for up to 6 months.\nQuick Breads\nIndian\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides\nSides",
