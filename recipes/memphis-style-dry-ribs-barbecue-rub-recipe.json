If using a vertical water smoker, such as the Weber Smokey Mountain, place ribs on top rack with water pan removed. If using a grill or offset smoker, place ribs over indirect heat. (See note.) Cook until ribs have a slight bend when lifted from one end, about 1 1/2 hours for baby backs and 2 hours for St. Louis-cut ribs, brushing liberally with mop every 15-20 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Joshua Bousel\nTransfer ribs to cutting board and brush with mop.

If that's not possible in your grill or smoker, then they can be cooked over indirect heat to keep the bottom of the ribs from burning.\nRead More\nOven Barbecue Pork Ribs Recipe\nCompetition-Style Barbecue Ribs Recipe\nKansas City-Style Barbecue Ribs Recipe\nCajun-Spiced Barbecue Ribs Recipe\nAmerican\nGrilled Pork\nSmoked Pork\nPork\nPork Mains"
