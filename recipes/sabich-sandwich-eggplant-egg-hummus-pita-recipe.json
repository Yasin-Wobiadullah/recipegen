Working in batches if necessary, fry eggplant slices, rotating for even browning and turning once halfway through, until golden on both sides and tender throughout, about 5 minutes; lower heat if oil begins to smoke.

Spoon some of the farmers salad and seasoned cabbage into each pita, drizzle with amba, and serve.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nAmba, a sauce made from pickled mango, and Middle Eastern pickles, which are spicier and more tart than American bread-and-butter pickles, are available from international and Middle Eastern grocers and online.\nRead More\nThe Best Smooth Hummus\nTahini Sauce With Garlic and Lemon\nPerfect Hard-Boiled Eggs\nMiddle Eastern\nVegetarian Mains\nBoiled Eggs\nSesame & Tahini\nEggplant"
