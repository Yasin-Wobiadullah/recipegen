  "full_text": "Fresh Silken Tofu Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n60 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nActive\n25 mins\nTotal\n70 mins\nServes\n6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nOne batch homemade\nsoy milk\n(\nsee recipe\n), about\n3\ncups\n, chilled\n1/2\nteaspoon Epsom salt or\nmagnesium chloride (nigari)\ndissolved in 2 tablespoons water\nOptional garnishes such as\ndried bonito flakes\n, soy sauce or ponzu sauce, freshly grated ginger, finely chopped cucumber, chopped scallion\nDirections\nPour the Epsom salt or magnesium chloride coagulant solution into the soy milk, using a spoon to blend them together with a couple of gentle plunging motions.\nTaking care not to agitate the mixture too much, distribute it among 6 1\u20442-cup heatproof bowls, cups or ramekins.\nPlace the filled dishes in a pan that is deep enough to accommodate them. Pour simmering water into the pan so that it reaches the same level as the soy milk mixture.\nCover the pan with a lid that is lined with a clean, dry dish towel (fold up the edges over the lid to prevent the towel from catching fire) and simmer gently over low heat until the tofu is just set. It should jiggle like a custard. The exact time will vary depending on the thickness and material of your dishes, but should be roughly 10 minutes. If you use larger dishes, it will take a little longer.\nCarefully remove the dishes from their water bath and allow the tofu to set a little further for about 10 minutes at room temperature.\nServe warm or chilled. The tofu can be served directly in their little bowls or inverted onto a small dish. Some serving suggestions: garnish with lemon zest, finely chopped cucumber, and sea salt flakes; dried bonito flakes and ponzu sauce; freshly grated ginger, chopped scallion, and soy sauce.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nHow to Make Fresh Silken Tofu from Soy Milk\nChinese\nVegan\nVegetarian\nStovetop\nSoy Milk",
