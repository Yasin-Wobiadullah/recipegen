In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat half of the oil over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Add half of the beef and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes; transfer browned short ribs to a plate. Add remaining oil to the pot and repeat the browning process with the rest of the beef. Allow beef to cool for 5 minutes, then cut into roughly 2- by 2 1/2-inch pieces.\nVicky Wasik\nReturn all beef and any accumulated juices to the pot and add enough water to fully cover (2 to 3 quarts/liters). Bring to a vigorous simmer, partially cover, and cook, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed to keep beef submerged, until beef is fully tender and can be pierced easily with a paring knife, 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours. Remove pot from heat and set aside to cool, keeping beef submerged in cooking liquid, for at least 30 minutes. When cool, transfer beef to a plate, and set aside along with 2 cups (475ml) of beef cooking liquid and 3 tablespoons (45ml) rendered beef fat, which should have risen to the surface of cooking liquid; remaining cooking liquid and fat can be refrigerated or frozen in an airtight container and saved for another use.\nVicky Wasik\nFor the Curry:\nIn a 3-quart saucepan, combine reserved rendered beef fat and 1/2 cup (120ml) coconut milk and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring often with a rubber spatula, until thickened slightly, about 3 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd curry paste, and use a rubber spatula to vigorously stir and work paste into coconut milk mixture until thoroughly combined, 2 to 3 minutes. (This requires a good amount of effort, as the paste is so stiff.) Cook, stirring and scraping constantly while gradually adding remaining 1/2 cup (120ml) coconut milk in 2-tablespoon (30ml) increments, until paste turns dark red and the fat begins to separate from curry paste, about 10 minutes.\nVicky Wasik\nAdd palm sugar, tamarind, and fish sauce, and stir to melt palm sugar. Add potatoes and stir to evenly coat with curry mixture. Add beef and reserved beef cooking liquid and bring to a simmer. Continue to cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a steady simmer, until potatoes are tender and a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a piece of potato, and curry is reduced to a thick, saucy consistency with a layer of separated fat on the surface, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat.\nVicky Wasik\nTransfer curry to a large serving bowl or divide between individual bowls. Serve with cooked jasmine rice.\nVicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nDutch oven\n,\n3-quart saucepan\nNotes\nWhen purchasing coconut milk, look for versions that have \"100% coconut milk\" as the only listed ingredient, rather than those made with coconut extract and water.\nPalm sugar can be found in Thai markets, as well as some nationwide supermarket chains like HMart and online.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe short ribs can be braised a day in advance; refrigerate them whole in their cooking liquid. The finished short rib curry can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on stovetop before serving. It is often assumed that curries, stews, and braises taste better the next day, but\nas we have covered\n, this is not always the case, especially with bright and acidic stews that lose their punch over time. While this flavor-muting phenomenon can be an issue for other Thai curries, this massaman curry tastes just as good the next day.\nThai\nStovetop Beef\nShort Ribs\nMains\nYukon Gold Potatoes"
