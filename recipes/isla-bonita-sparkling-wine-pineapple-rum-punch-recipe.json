If desired, line bottom of container with thinly sliced lime wheels before freezing.\nFor the Vanilla Simple Syrup:\nCombine water and sugar in a saucepan with vanilla pods and seeds. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar, and bring to a simmer, then remove from heat. Fine-strain into a resealable container, discarding pods. Syrup can be refrigerated up to 1 week.\nFor the Punch:\nAdd mint and Vanilla Simple Syrup to a large measuring cup or bowl with a pour spout. Muddle gently to bruise mint and release flavor. Add pineapple juice, lime juice, and rum, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer into serving vessel. Punch can be covered and refrigerated up to 2 hours at this point, or you can proceed immediately to step 4.\nWhen ready to serve, stir again, then add chilled sparkling wine and ice block or large cubes. Garnish bowl with lime wheels and mint leaves and ladle punch into ice-filled glasses.\nSpecial Equipment\nJuicer\nor\nblender\n(see note);\nmuddler\n;\nfine-mesh strainer\n; 4-quart pitcher or punch bowl\nNotes\nTo make fresh pineapple juice without a juicer, cut your pineapples into chunks and whir them in the blender, then strain the pur\u00e9e through a fine-mesh strainer.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe syrup can be refrigerated in a resealable container for up to 1 week.\nThe strained mixture of syrup, juice, and rum can be refrigerated for up to 2 hours before serving.\nRead More\nPineapple Rum Punch Recipe\nFresh Pineapple Margaritas Recipe\nSergeant Pepper (Pineapple-Gin Cocktail With Cumin) Recipe\nRum\nSummer Drinks"
