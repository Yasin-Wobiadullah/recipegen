In a food processor, pulse flour, raw sugar, lemon zest, nutmeg, and salt until well combined, about 3 pulses. Add pecans;\u00a0 pulse just until pecans start to break apart, 2 to 3 pulses. (Some whole pecans should still be visible.) Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles a coarse meal, with pea-sized chunks, 20 to 25 pulses. Transfer to a large bowl and chill in refrigerator or freezer until ready to bake.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Assemble and Bake:\nIn a large mixing bowl, toss apples, sugar, cornstarch, salt, and whiskey until evenly coated. Transfer to a 2-quart baking dish; cover with crisp topping, spreading it into an even layer across the dish. Do not pack topping down with your hands. Bake until topping is golden brown, and apples are tender when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes. Let crisp cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nFood processor, 2-quart baking dish\nNotes\nYou can substitute 1 teaspoon (4 blades) mace in place of the nutmeg for a more complex flavor.\nWe recommend using a mix of firm, tart apples like Fuji and Jonagold, as well as softer Golden Delicious.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe topping can be made up to 5 days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container. The topping can be frozen for up to 3 months.\nLeftover crisp can be stored in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days. Reheat in a 350\u00baF (175\u00baC) oven or microwave until warmed through.\nOnce cooled, the crisp can be wrapped tightly in foil and plastic wrap and rozen for up to 3 months.\nApple\nThanksgiving Desserts\nPies\nFall Desserts"
