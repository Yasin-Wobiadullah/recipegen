In a 7-quart pot or Dutch oven, combine the detached chicken breasts, legs, chicken carcass, celery, carrots, black peppercorns, bay leaves, salt, and water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook uncovered until chicken breasts register 160\u2109 (71\u00baC) with a digital thermometer, about 35 minutes, skimming any scum that rises to the surface.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nUsing tongs, remove chicken breasts and transfer to a cutting board. Continue simmering the chicken legs until the thighs and drumsticks are cooked and register 175\u2109 (80\u00baC) on an instant-read thermometer, another 15 minutes. Using tongs, remove thighs and drumsticks and transfer to cutting board. Simmer broth with remaining carcass until slightly reduced and broth develops a rich flavor, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let broth cool slightly, about 15 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nUsing tongs, remove chicken carcass and transfer to cutting board with breast and legs and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain broth into a large bowl or heat-proof container and discard solids; measure out 6 cups broth and set aside. Wipe pot clean. Cool and reserve the remaining broth for another use. (See notes.)\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nUsing 2 large forks, shred breast, thigh, and drumstick meat, and any remaining meat from the chicken carcass into bite-size pieces. Transfer shredded meat to a bowl and discard bones and skin.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nFor the Soup:\nIn now-empty pot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Once melted, add onion, carrot, celery, thyme, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, 7 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables are evenly coated and flour begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, 1 to 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nWhisk in the chicken stock, evaporated milk, salt, and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper as needed. Reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer while preparing the dumplings.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nFor the Dumplings:\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, pepper, and thyme. Using a flexible spatula, incorporate sour cream, butter, and milk, stirring until fully combined. (Avoid overmixing, which will result in tough dumplings.)\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nStir the shredded chicken into the soup. Using 2 large spoons, work quickly to gently drop golf ball\u2013size portions of dumpling dough into simmering soup; you should have about 15 dumplings. Some dumplings may dissolve slightly into the soup. This is OK as it will further thicken the soup. Cover and gently simmer until dumplings are fluffy, cooked through, and have doubled in size, about 10 minutes. Top with parsley and serve.\nSerious Eats / Lorena Masso\nSpecial Equipment\n8- to 10-quart pot or Dutch oven, tongs, fine-mesh strainer, whisk\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe stock can be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container or frozen for 3 to 4 months. The chicken can be shredded and stored separately in an airtight container.\nOnce cooled, the soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days. Keep in mind that the dumplings may absorb more liquid as they sit, resulting in a thicker soup.\nThe soup can be frozen in an airtight container for up to 1 month. Do not freeze the dumplings, as they will lose their delicate texture.\nChicken\nThe Latest\nStovetop Chicken\nFall\nWinter"
