Transfer milk to a large heatproof bowl and let cool until it registers between 105\u00b0F (41\u00b0C) and 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C).\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd yeast and 1 teaspoon (4g) sugar to bowl of warm milk and let sit for 5 minutes. The mixture should froth and foam. (If it doesn't, this likely means your yeast has expired; buy a new packet before making this recipe.) Add half of flour (3/4 cup; 4 ounces; 113g) and whisk mixture until smooth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot until mixture has approximately doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nAdd remaining 3/4 cup flour (4 ounces; 113g) and 1 teaspoon (4g) sugar, as well as salt, melted butter, vegetable oil, and egg yolks. Whisk until ingredients are well incorporated but batter is still slightly lumpy.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a small bowl using a whisk, or using an electric mixer, whisk egg whites until they hold soft peaks. Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold egg whites into batter until just combined.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) or its lowest possible setting. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle set to 350\u00b0F/177\u00b0C). Add a small amount of vegetable oil to the skillet and spread with a paper towel until no visible oil remains. Using a spoon, place silver dollar pancake\u2013sized circles of batter (about 2 1/2 inches in diameter) in the skillet. Cook until the bubbles that appear on the surface of the blini stop being reabsorbed into the batter and remain distinct, and bottom sides of blini are light golden brown, about 2 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCarefully flip blini and cook on second side until light golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Wrap finished blini in a clean kitchen towel, place towel on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and transfer to oven to keep warm. Repeat blini-cooking process until all of the batter is used up.\nServe blini with sour cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, chilled caviar or smoked salmon, and traditional accompaniments, such as finely minced shallots, sliced chives, and chopped hard-boiled eggs.\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\nnonstick skillet\n,\nwhisk\nor\nstand mixer\n,\nwire rack\n,\nrimmed baking sheet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBlini are best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nBuckwheat Blini\nSerious Eats Guide: How to Buy Caviar\nPancakes\nStovetop\nHors D'Oeuvres\nChristmas Appetizers\nNew Years",
