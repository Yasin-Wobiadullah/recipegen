Season with salt. In a plastic zipper-top bag, combine chicken and yogurt mixture and mix thoroughly to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.\nTurn on broiler and set oven rack about 6 inches from broiler element. In a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet, toast the almonds under the broiler until slightly browned, about 2 minutes (check frequently as broilers can vary considerably). Remove almonds from the pan and set them aside.\nScrape chicken and yogurt marinade into the same skillet. Broil, turning once, until chicken is browned on both sides and just cooked through, about 6 minutes per side (again, check frequently as broilers vary). Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken pieces from the skillet and set aside in a warm place.\nScrape yogurt mixture from the skillet into a heatproof measuring cup. If needed, stir in enough water to bring the total volume up to 1 cup. Return 1 cup of the yogurt mixture to the skillet and broil until boiling, about 2 minutes.\nAdd the couscous to the skillet, scatter dates on top and cover skillet to allow couscous to steam in the hot liquid for 5 minutes. Uncover. Either directly in the skillet or in a serving bowl, toss couscous with half the toasted almonds, half the parsley, and the remaining lemon juice. Top with the chicken, garnish with the remaining almonds and parsley, and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch\ncast iron\nor\nstainless steel skillet\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe chicken can be marinated for up to 8 hours before cooking.\nRead More\nThe Science of Yogurt Marinades\nTandoor-Style Grilled Chickens or Cornish Hens Recipe\nGrilled Tandoori Chicken Patties With Jalape\u00f1o-Mint Yogurt Sauce\nThe Best Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe\nChicken Mains\nIndian\nRoasted Chicken\nChicken Thighs\nCouscous",
