Stir in all-purpose flour until the mixture comes together into a shaggy mass.\nSerious Eats / Yvonne Ruperti\nUsing clean hands, knead the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes or until it becomes smooth and very elastic, adding only very small amounts of extra flour if dough is extremely sticky (see note). Alternatively, knead dough at low speed in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment until dough is very elastic and smooth, about 8 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Yvonne Ruperti\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and form into a smooth ball. Lightly oil a clean mixing bowl and place dough inside, then rub oiled hands over the top of the dough. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.\nSerious Eats / Yvonne Ruperti\nMeanwhile, place a baking steel or 12-inch cast iron skillet on the top oven rack and preheat oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). Line a plate with a large, clean kitchen towel and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Yvonne Ruperti\nPunch down the dough, transfer to a lightly floured work surface, and cut into 6 even pieces. Form each dough piece into an even ball. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.\nRoll each piece of dough into about a 7-inch circle, no more than 1/4 inch thick, taking care not to tear dough and keeping the thickness even all around. Place dough disks on a lightly floured surface, cover with a damp towel, and let proof until slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.\nWorking with as many pitas as will fit on the steel at once, pick up each pita and place on the steel top side down. (If using a cast iron skillet, bake one pita at a time.) Immediately close the oven door and bake until pitas have puffed and are slightly golden around the edges, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to over-bake.\nSerious Eats / Yvonne Ruperti\nPlace baked pitas onto towel-lined plate and wrap with the overhanging towel. Repeat with any remaining pitas.\nSerious Eats / Yvonne Ruperti\nFor an extra-charred finish, heat a cast iron skillet on the stovetop over high heat until smoking. Working with one pita at a time, briefly heat each side until charred in a few spots, about 30 seconds. Return pita to towel and cover. Repeat with remaining pitas and serve immediately.\nSerious Eats / Yvonne Ruperti\nSpecial Equipment\nBaking steel\n, 12-inch\ncast iron skillet\n,\nrolling pin\nNotes\nWhen kneading the dough, it should be slightly tacky, not dry. This recipe may be doubled. Pitas can be baked ahead of time and frozen, with parchment layered between them, then wrapped in foil and plastic wrap. Defrost, then toast in skillet as per recipe.\nRead More\nLavash (Armenian Flatbread)\nTaboon (Palestinian Flatbread)\nHomemade Falafel\nYeast Breads\nMiddle Eastern\nDairy-free Sides\nVegan Sides\nVegetarian Sides"
