Preheat oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Spread bread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger trays on oven racks and bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total, rotating trays and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 20 minutes. Turn off oven.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nWhile bread is cooling: In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides (do not allow butter to brown), about 2 minutes. Add sausage and, using a stiff whisk or potato masher, break sausage into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no bigger than 1/4 inch). Cook, stirring frequently, until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. Add onions, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add half of chicken stock.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nIn a medium bowl, whisk remaining chicken stock, eggs, and 3 tablespoons parsley until homogeneous. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture. Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nGrease the inside of a large 7-qt. slow cooker with butter. Transfer stuffing to slow cooker. Cover with lid and set to low heat. Cook until stuffing registers 210\u00baF (98\u00baC), about 5 hours. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving. Keep warm or sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley to serve.\nSerious Eats / Fred Hardy\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheets, Dutch oven, slow cooker\nNotes\n2 teaspoons dried sage leaves can be substituted for 1/4 cup minced fresh sage.\nIf using homemade or low-sodium stock, season to taste with salt and pepper before adding.\nIf desired, dried or fresh fruits and nuts can be folded into the stuffing along with the bread cubes in Step 3. This makes an excellent bird stuffing, producing enough to stuff several small birds or two 18- to 22-pound birds.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nBread can be dried out and, once cooled, stored in an airtight container or zip-top bag at room temperature for up to 5 days.\nStuffing can be prepared through step 3, covered with aluminum foil, and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance. When ready to cook, discard foil and proceed with step 4 of recipe.\nSides\nThanksgiving Stuffings\nSlow Cooker\nSausages\nSage",
