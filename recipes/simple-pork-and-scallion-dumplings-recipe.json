Spread the pork pieces on a rimmed baking sheet, leaving space between the pieces than place in the freezer for 15 minutes until just starting to freeze, but still pliable.\nIn bowl of food processor, combine salted pork, bacon, egg, stock, soy sauce, and sugar. Process until a rough puree is formed and pieces of pork are no larger than 1/8th of an inch, about 20 seconds. Add leeks to food processor and pulse until evenly incorporated, about 6 one-second pulses.\nWorking with a few skins at a time, place approximately 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each wrapper. Use your finger to spread a small amount of water around the edge of each wrapper. Seal wrappers by folding in half and pleating one side 5 or 6 times, pinching the edges together as you go. Place finished dumplings on a parchment-lined baking sheet, separating them to avoid sticking, and covering the whole thing with a clean, damp washcloth.\nLine a bamboo steamer with wilted cabbage or lettuce leaves, or create a\nparchment liner\n. Place dumplings in steamer, leaving a small gap between each one a place over a wok of simmering water. Steam for 7 to 9 minutes until skins are translucent and filling is cooked through. Serve immediately with soy sauce, chili paste, Chinkiang vinegar, black vinegar, or plain rice vinegar.\nSpecial Equipment\nCarbon steel wok\n, bamboo steamer\nRead More\nWok Skills 101: How to Steam in a Wok\nSnacks & Appetizers\nStovetop\nPork\nScallions"
