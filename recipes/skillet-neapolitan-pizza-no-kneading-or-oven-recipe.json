Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n25 mins\nCook\n25 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nResting and Rising Time\n10 hrs\nTotal\n10 hrs 50 mins\nServes\n4\nto 6 servings\nMakes\n4 pizzas\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n16\nounces\n(about\n3\ncups\nplus\n2\ntablespoons\n)\nall-purpose flour\n, plus more for dusting\n.3\nounces\n(about\n2 1/3\nteaspoons\n)\nkosher salt\n, plus extra for assembly\n.2\nounces\n(about\n1\nteaspoon\n)\nactive dry yeast\n12\nounces\nwater\n1\n(\n14-ounce) can\nwhole peeled Italian tomatoes packed in juice\n1\n(12- to 16-ounce) ball\nbuffalo mozzarella\nor fresh cow's milk mozzarella, at room temperature\n4\ntablespoons\nextra-virgin olive oil\nHandful\nfresh basil leaves\nDirections\nCombine flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Whisk until homogenous. Add water and stir with hands until dough comes together and no dry flour remains. Dough will be very sticky. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 8 to 16 hours.\nTurn dough out onto heavily floured board and using floured hands, divide into four pieces. Form each piece into a ball and place on floured board, leaving a few inches of space between each ball. Cover with plastic wrap or with a well-floured clean dish towel. Let rise for two hours.\nMeanwhile, roughly blend tomatoes in a food processor, blender, with a hand blender, or by hand. Season to taste with salt. Roughly tear mozzarella into 1/2- to 1-inch chunks and squeeze out excess whey.\nWhen dough has risen, gently stretch one dough ball on a well-floured board into a round about 6 inches in diameter. Gently lift dough and drape across knuckles, slowly stretching it out by rotating it around your knuckles until it's about 10 inches across.\nPreheat a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of water dropped on its surface forms a bead that skids around (about 500 to 600\u00b0F). Carefully transfer dough to skillet and cover with tight-fitting lid. Cook until bottom side is very lightly browned and dough has puffed up in spots, about 1 minute. Remove dough with a metal spatula. deflate all bubbles in the center of the dough, leaving bubbles around the edges.\nFlip dough and return to skillet so that the cooked side is now facing up. cook, shaking occasionally until the dough is darkly charred in spots. Remove to cutting board and invert (so that first-cooked side is now back on the bottom)\nIf using a blow torch\n: carefully torch edges of crust until roughly charred and browned in spots. Continue with step 8.\nIf using a gas burner\n: Place pizza dough top-side down (the side you cooked second facing down) with the very edge hanging over the edge of the skillet. Cook the overhanging edge directly over the flame of a gas burner until well-charred. Rotate pizza so new section is overhanging edge and char again. Repeat until entire crust edge is charred. Continue with step 8. Alternatively, place a wire cooling rack directly over the burner flame. Invert pizza dough and use flame from burner to char and brown the edges of the crust. Continue with step 8.\nIf using an electric burner\n: Proceed to step 8.\nMake sure dough is facing right-side up (it should be facing the same way it was when you first put it in the skillet). Spread a few tablespoons of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving the risen bubbly edges uncovered. Scatter a few pieces of mozzarella and a few basil leaves over the pizza. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Return pizza to skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until bottom is nicely charred and mozzarella is melted, about 3 minutes longer. If using torch, you can use it to help melt the cheese.\nServe pizza immediately. Repeat steps 4 through 8 with remaining three balls of dough.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Pizza Lab: Awesome Pizza Without An Oven (a.k.a. Skillet Pizza)\nPizza\nStovetop",
