Place potatoes and faux tourn\u00e9 carrots in a medium saucepan, cover with cold salted water, bring to a boil, and simmer until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Add Brussels sprouts, season with salt and pepper, toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nTransfer chicken backbone to now-empty saucepan. Add roughly chopped carrot, onion, celery, sage, and bay leaves. Set aside. Season chicken pieces thoroughly with salt and pepper.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add chicken pieces skin side-down and cook, moving chicken as little as possible, until chicken skin is rendered and deep golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes, reducing heat if smoking excessively. Flip pieces as they finish and lightly brown second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer browned chicken pieces to a plate and set aside.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nWhen all chicken is browned, add white wine to skillet and scrape up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Transfer white wine to saucepan with chicken backbone. Pour in any juices that have accumulated on the chicken resting plate and wipe out skillet with a paper towel.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nAdd stock to pot with chicken backbone. Bring to a simmer over high heat, reduce to lowest setting, cover, and let gently bubble while the chicken roasts.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nAdd remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and heat over high heat until lightly smoking. Add vegetable mixture. Top with chicken pieces, skin side-up. Transfer to oven. Roast until chicken breast pieces register 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) and chicken legs register at least 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, removing pieces and transferring them to a clean plate as they finish roasting, 20 to 45 minutes total.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nWhen all chicken pieces have finished roasting, add shallots to skillet with vegetables and toss to combine. Return to oven and continue roasting, flipping vegetables occasionally, until vegetables and shallots are browned all over, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from oven, add parsley, toss to coat, then place chicken directly on top of vegetables.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nStrain simmering chicken broth mixture into a small saucepan or bowl. Whisk in butter, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and fish sauce. Season jus to taste with salt and pepper. Serve chicken and vegetables immediately, serving jus at the table.\nSerious Eats / Mariel De La Cruz\nSpecial Equipment\nLarge\ncast iron skillet\n, medium\nsaucepan\nChicken Mains\nRoasted Chicken\nWhole Chicken",
