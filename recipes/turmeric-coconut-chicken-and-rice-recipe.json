Set aside in a bowl and cover with several inches of water.\nIn a large heavy pot, combine coconut milk, ginger, jalepe\u00f1o, turmeric, sugar, kecap manis, and paprika. Bring to a bare simmer for 10 minutes, covered. Salt chicken generously, then add to pot and cook at a bare simmer, covered, for half an hour, or until chicken is cooked through. Remove chicken and set aside to cool. Strain broth to remove chunks of ginger and chile, then let rest until fat floats to top and can be skimmed off.\nStrain rice from water and rinse again until water runs clear. Return coconut broth to pot, add rice, and cover with water so liquid is 1/2 inch above rice. Cook rice on medium-low heat, adding water if needed (better to err on too much water than too little). When rice is finished, fold in bok choy and cover pot to keep warm.\nWhen chicken is cool enough to handle, remove from bone and tear into large chunks. Discard skin. Place chicken in a single layer, well-spaced out, in an oven-safe skillet or sheet pan, and broil until top is crispy. Keep an eye on chicken to make sure it does not burn.\nIn a separate skillet, heat oil on high and add shallots, scallions, and jalepe\u00f1o. Fry for two to three minutes, until wilted, slightly crispy, and aromatic. Set aside.\nTo serve, add rice to a plate or a wide, shallow bowl. Top with chicken, then shallot-scallion topping. Add some slices of cucumber, then sprinkle on sriracha and lime juice, finishing with cilantro.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nSpice Hunting: Turmeric\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Thighs\nCoconut Milk & Cream\nRice & Grains\nBok Choy"
