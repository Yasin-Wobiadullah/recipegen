Scrape onto a plate, spread into a 1-inch layer, cover and cool to about 75\u00b0F (23\u00b0C), around 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nFor the Dough:\nPulse flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Once combined, add cooled yukone and water. Process until dough is silky smooth, and a small piece can be stretched into a sheet without tearing, about 90 seconds. The exact timing will vary with the power and capacity of a given machine. For smaller machines, the reduced capacity and power will necessitate dividing dough in half to process in stages.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Shape:\nTurn dough onto a clean, un-floured surface, and divide into 8 roughly equal portions (3 ounces or 85g each) and cover with plastic. Cup a portion of dough beneath your palm and work in quick, circular motions to form a tight ball, with only a tiny seam along the bottom.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIf the seam is large or irregular, continue rounding until the bottom is nearly smooth, like the ball of dough on the left.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nKeep the shaped dough covered in plastic and let rest 15 minutes.\nTo form the bagels, poke a hole into the center of each portion with a damp fingertip, then gently stretch into a 3 1/4-inch ring, wetting your hands in cold water as needed to prevent sticking. Arrange on a well-greased, parchment-lined half sheet pan, cover with plastic, and refrigerate 24 to 36 hours, depending on your schedule.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Boil:\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Fill a stainless steel pot with about 3 inches of water, stir in barley malt syrup, and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet or cutting board with a thick layer of paper towels. Working two or three at a time, boil the bagels about 30 seconds per side. Drain on paper towels for two or three seconds, then transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan. (If left on the paper towels too long, the bagels will stick; if this happens, quickly dip the bagel back into the hot water, and the wet paper towel will peel right off.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTo Finish:\nBake the bagels until blistered and golden brown all over, about 25 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes. To serve, split horizontally with a serrated knife. Uncut, bagels can be stored up to 48 hours in a paper bag (or loosely wrapped in parchment), then sliced and briefly toasted to serve.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch skillet\n,\nfood processor\n, 3- or 4-quart\nstainless steel pot\nNotes\nBagels that are both chewy and flavorful do best with bread flour made from hard red wheat; for this recipe, my favorite is King Arthur. Other brands may include a portion of hard white wheat, a mellow variety that can leave bagels tasting flat.\nRead More\n6 Common Bagel-Making Problems and How to Fix Them\nCinnamon Raisin Bagels\nBreakfast & Brunch\nVegan Breakfast & Brunch\nVegetarian Breakfast & Brunch\nYeast Breads\nEaster"
