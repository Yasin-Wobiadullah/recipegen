Season on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add salmon fillets, skin side down. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, pressing gently on back of fillets to ensure good contact between the skin and the pan, until skin is rendered and crisp, about 6 minutes. If skin shows resistance when you attempt to lift with a spatula, allow it to continue to cook until it lifts easily.\nFlip salmon and cook on second side until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) for medium-rare or 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) for medium, about 1 minute longer. Transfer salmon to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to drain.\nDivide rice evenly between 4 serving bowls. Top with diced avocado, cucumber, and scallions. Top each with a salmon fillet and spoon sauce on top, using the back of a spoon to evenly glaze each fillet. Sprinkle with furikake and/or sesame seeds. Serve immediately.\nSpecial Equipment\nInstant-read thermometer\nNotes\nFurikake is a blend of seasonings typically used to flavor rice. It is available in multiple flavors at Japanese groceries or online.\nSalmon\nStovetop Seafood\nWhite Rice\nAvocado\nCucumbers"
