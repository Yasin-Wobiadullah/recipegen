Set aside.\nWash the chicken inside and out and remove any excess fat. Place in a large Ziploc bag and pour in about 2/3 of the mojo sauce, reserving the rest. Seal the bag and toss to evenly distribute the marinade, then open and reseal the bag, removing as much air as possible. Let marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 6 hours.\nRemove the chicken from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature while you prepare the grill. Light a chimney 3/4 full of charcoal. When the charcoal is fully lit and covered in gray ash, pour the coals out and arrange them on either side of the charcoal grate, keeping the middle empty. Place chicken on the rotisserie and cook at 300 degrees until an instant read thermometer registers 165 degrees in the thickest part of the breast, about 1 1/2 hours. Baste the chicken every 20-30 minutes with the reserved mojo sauce while cooking. Remove the chicken from the rotisserie and let rest for 15 minutes, carve and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nGrill with a rotisserie attachement\nChicken Mains\nGrilled Chicken\nWhole Chicken\nMemorial Day"
