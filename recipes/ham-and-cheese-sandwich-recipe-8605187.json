  "full_text": "Ham and Cheese Sandwich\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n10 mins\nResting Time\n5 mins\nTotal\n20 mins\nServes\n2\nMakes\n2 Sandwiches\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\nFour\n1/2-inch-thick slices\ncrusty bread\nor\nhearty sandwich bread\n(see notes)\n2\ntablespoons\nmayonnaise\nor softened\nunsalted butter,\ndivided\n2\nteaspoons\n(\n10\ng\n)\nDijon mustard\n, divided\n8\nthin slices\nounces\nSwiss\n,\nGruy\u00e8re\n, or\ncheddar cheese\n(about\n4\nounces\n;\n115\ng\n), divided\n6\nounces\n(\n170\ng\n) thinly\nsliced ham\n(about\n12\nslices\n), divided\n8 to 12\npickles chips\n, optional\nDirections\nPlace bread slices on a clean work surface. Using a butter knife, spread 1 teaspoon mayonnaise or butter evenly over 1 side of each slice. Place 2 slices (mayonnaise side down) into a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Spread the top (dry side) of the 2 bread slices in skillet with the remaining mayonnaise or butter.\nPlace 2 slices (about 1 ounce) of the cheese in an even layer on each bread slice in skillet. (Cut and/or layer cheese if needed to avoid cheese draping off the sides of the bread.) Top with the ham and pickle chips (if using), divided evenly between the 2 slices. Top with the remaining cheese ( 2 slices per sandwich). Spread 1 teaspoon mayonnaise evenly over the dry side of the remaining 2 bread slices, then spread with mustard. Close each sandwich with the remaining bread slices, mustard side down. Using a spatula, press firmly to adhere.\nSerious Eats/Amanda Suarez\nHeat skillet over medium heat and cook until bread is golden brown on bottom, 4 to 6 minutes. Using 2 spatulas, flip sandwiches. Set an empty large Dutch oven or other heavy skillet or cooking weight directly on top of sandwiches, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until second side is golden brown and cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.\nSerious Eats/Amanda Suarez\nUsing a spatula, transfer sandwiches to a wire rack and let sit for 5 minutes. Transfer sandwiches to a cutting board, cut in half and serve warm.\nSerious Eats/Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n12-inch nonstick skillet, large Dutch oven or other heavy skillet or cooking weight\nNotes\nI like to use rustic artisanal bread for this recipe; avoid using baguette, but rather look for a wide loaf that will yield flat slices for direct contact with the skillet.\nVariations\nFeel free to customize this sandwich any way you\u2019d like. Here are a few examples.\nServe it untoasted:\nThe sandwich can be made cold and untoasted. Use the same ingredients and layer the ingredients within the sandwich in the same order, just omit spreading mayonnaise on the exterior of the sandwich.\nSwap in butter for mayonnaise:\nWhile I\u2019ve sung mayo\u2019s praises above as the fat of choice with this ham and cheese, don\u2019t feel tied to using it. You can swap in softened butter for the mayo in this recipe, both as the condiment and the cooking medium.\nOmit the pickles:\nIf you don\u2019t like pickles, don\u2019t use them. It\u2019s that simple.\nAdd your preferred fillings:\nYou can use this technique and ratio of cheese to meat as a starting point and swap in your preferred deli meat or use a combo of meats. I\u2019d still recommend using thinly sliced meat. Or add some heat to the sandwich with sliced pickled banana peppers or even some chili crisp. Have fun with it.\nSandwiches\nThe Latest\nAmerican\nStovetop\nHam",
