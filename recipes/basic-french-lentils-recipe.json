  "full_text": "Basic French Lentils Recipe | Cook the Book\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n10 mins\nCook\n60 mins\nTotal\n70 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nlentils\u00a0du Puy\n1\nclove\n1\nsmall\nonion\n, peeled\n1\nmedium\ncarrot\n, trimmed, peeled, and cut into 4 to 6 pieces\n1\ncelery stalk\n, trimmed, peeled, and cut into 4 to 6 pieces\n1\ngarlic clove\n, smashed, peeled, and germ removed\n1\nbay leaf\n3 1/2\ncups\nchicken broth\n,\nvegetable broth\n, or\nwater\n1\ntablespoon\nCognac\n(optional)\n1\nshallot\n, finely chopped, rinsed, and patted dry (optional)\nFresh ground pepper\nDirections\nPut the lentils in a strainer and pick through them, discarding any bits of stone that might have escaped the packers; rinse under cold running water.\nTurn the lentils into a medium saucepan, cover them with cold water, bring to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes; spill the lentils out into the strainer. Drain, rinse the lentils again, and rinse out the saucepan.\nPress the clove into the onion and toss the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, and bay leaf into the pan. Pour in the broth or water, stir in the lentils, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a steady simmer and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are almost tender. As the lentils cook, skim off the solids that rise to the top and stir as needed. Season with salt and pepper and cook until they\u2019re tender, another 5 to 10 minutes, then pour in the Cognac, if you\u2019re using it. Give everything a good stir and another minute over the heat.\nDrain the lentils, reserving the cooking liquid if you\u2019re going to want to reheat them. Remove the vegetables and either discard them all or discard the clove and bay leaf and finely chop the vegetables, which will be soft but tasty. Stir the vegetables back into the lentils. If you\u2019re using the shallot, stir it in now (I think it adds a lot to the mix).\nThe lentils are ready to be served now, set aside and reheated over low heat in the liquid you\u2019ve reserved, or used in other recipes.\nStoring:\nOnce cooled, the lentils and their liquid can be packed airtight and kept chilled for up to 3 days. Warm in a covered saucepan over gentle heat.\nLentils\nFrench",
