  "full_text": "Ultra-Flavorful Fresh Limeade Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n15 mins\nActive\n30 mins\nResting Time\n3 hrs\nTotal\n3 hrs 15 mins\nServes\n6 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\npounds\n(\n1.3\nkg\n)\nlimes\n(\n12 to 16\nmedium\nlimes\n)\n14\nounces\nsugar\n(\n2\ncups\n;\n400\ng\n)\n24\nounces\ncold\nwater\n(\n3\ncups\n;\n700\nml\n)\nDirections\nBring limes to room temperature, then roll firmly against the counter to soften their rinds. Halve and juice; set juice aside. Cut rinds into 1-inch chunks. Toss with sugar in a large nonreactive mixing bowl, cover tightly with plastic, and let stand at room temperature, stirring once every 45 minutes or so, until sugar has completely dissolved, about 3 hours. (You can let the mixture stand up to 12 hours, if desired.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nAdd water and 6 ounces (3/4 cup; 180ml) of reserved lime juice. Stir well, then strain through a nonreactive fine-mesh strainer or piece of cheesecloth into a glass or ceramic container. At this point, the concentrated limeade can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nWhen ready to serve, pour limeade over ice and adjust to taste with additional water or lime juice, depending on personal preference; bear in mind, though, that the limeade will be diluted as the ice melts. (You will likely have some fresh lime juice left over, which can be reserved for another use, though exactly how much you have will depend on how much you added to adjust the limeade.)\nSpecial Equipment\nCheesecloth or nonreactive\nfine-mesh strainer\n, two-quart pitcher\nNotes\nIf you like, some or all of the limes can be zested beforehand and reserved for another baking project. A lime twist on\nlemon meltaways\n, perhaps? Leftover juice can be used to make a lime variation on\nlemon bars\nas well.\nRead More\nNimbu Soda (Indian-Style Lime Soda)\nCocktail 101: How to Make Oleo-Saccharum\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nLime\nFather's Day"
