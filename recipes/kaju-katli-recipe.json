Place cashew powder in a medium mixing bowl, then whisk in milk powder and cardamom.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a 2-quart saucepan, heat sugar and water over medium-high heat until sugar has melted. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches 230\u00b0F (110\u00b0C) on a probe or candy thermometer, about 4 minutes. Alternatively, you can judge the doneness of the candy syrup by placing a drop of it on your thumb, making sure to let it cool enough first that you don't burn yourself. Allow the drop of syrup to cool to room temperature, then pinch it between your thumb and index finger and pull them apart; the syrup is done when a single strand stretches between your fingers without breaking. (This is called a \"one-string consistency\" in Indian candy-making terminology.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nTurn heat to low and add cashew mixture, stirring continuously with a heat-resistant flexible spatula. The mixture should pull away from the sides of the pan and form a loose ball. Add ghee and mix well for a few seconds, then remove pan from heat.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nPlace a sheet of parchment paper on a clean work surface and carefully scoop hot cashew dough on top. Set a second piece of parchment paper on top of the cashew dough. Knead the hot cashew dough through the paper for a few seconds to help bring it together. Using a rolling pin, roll cashew dough out into a single even sheet about 1/8 inch (3mm) thick. Remove top layer of parchment.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nLet dough stand 1 minute. If desired, carefully lay edible silver leaf (silver vark) all over the dough. Then, using a sharp knife, cut dough into diamond-shaped pieces 1 to 1 1/2 inches (2.5 to 4cm) long. Allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSpecial Equipment\nProbe thermometer\n, 2-quart\nsaucepan\n,\nrolling pin\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe kaju katli can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.\nRead More\nMilk Creams (Indian Cashew Sweets) Recipe\nSalted Cashew Caramel Bars Recipe\nShining a Light on Diwali Treats: An Opinionated Guide\nGulab Jamun\nDesserts\nIndian\nStovetop\nCashews\nDiwali"
