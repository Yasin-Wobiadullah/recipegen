Line a plate or tray with absorbent paper towels or a wire rack. Heat the pan over medium-high heat, grill the marinated paneer pieces in batches. Don\u2019t be hasty to remove the paneer, wait until the edges start to brown the paneer releases from the pan with ease, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the cooked paneer pieces to serving platter and keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Dressing:\nIn a small bowl, whisk the oil, lime juice, honey, allspice, paprika, and red pepper flakes until combined.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nFor the Salad:\nPlace the mixed greens, cucumber, chickpeas, mint, and cilantro in a large mixing bowl. Lightly season the salad with salt and toss to combine. Pour the dressing over the mixed greens in the bowl, and toss to combine. Season with additional salt and pepper, to taste. Serve alongside grilled paneer, with wedges of lime alongside.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nNotes\nIf using spicy hot red pepper flake, reduce the quantity by half.\nPaneer\nIndian\nGrilling\nThe Latest"
