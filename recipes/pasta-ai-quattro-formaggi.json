Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan with a flexible spatula to prevent scorching, then remove from heat and let steep 5 minutes. Remove and discard garlic and thyme.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nReturn infused cream to low heat and add Taleggio, whisking constantly until Taleggio is fully melted.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nAdd grated Gruy\u00e8re (or Fontina) and continue to whisk until fully melted and a smooth sauce forms. Whisk in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Keep warm.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nMeanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente. Using a spider skimmer, transfer pasta to cheese sauce; alternatively, strain pasta in a colander, making sure to first reserve 1 cup (240ml) pasta-cooking water. Add 1/4 cup (60ml) pasta-cooking water to pasta and sauce and, working over medium-low heat, stir gently until pasta is coated in a creamy glaze. If sauce becomes too thick, add more pasta water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, to loosen to proper glazing consistency. Season with salt to taste.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nRemove from heat and stir in gorgonzola; it may completely melt into the sauce, but it's fine (arguably even desirable) if some pieces remain mostly intact.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nServe right away, passing more grated Parmigiano-Reggiano at the table.\nSerious Eats / Daniel Gritzer\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucier\nor\nsaucepan\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThis pasta is best enjoyed immediately.\nRead More\nNeapolitan Pasta Cacio e Uova\nCacio e Pepe Recipe (Spaghetti with Black Pepper & Pecorino Romano)\nThe Food Lab's Ultra-Gooey Stovetop Mac and Cheese\nThe Science of Melting Cheese\nA Guide to Different Types of Cheese You Should Know\nPasta Mains\nItalian\nStovetop Pasta\nCheese\nFusilli & Radiatori",
