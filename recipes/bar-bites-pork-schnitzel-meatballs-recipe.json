Add the ground pork, thyme, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, pepper, and parsley and gently mix until thoroughly incorporated.\nWorking with wet hands, use a tablespoon measure to scoop out meat mixture and roll between your palms to form a meatball about an inch in diameter. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet or large plate and repeat until all the mixture is used.\nPlace the flour, egg, and remaining cup of Panko into three separate medium bowls or shallow dishes. Dredge each meatball in the flour, then in the egg, and finally in the panko. Replace the breaded meatballs on the rimmed baking sheet or plate.\nHeat the oil in a large cast iron skillet, Dutch oven, or wok until it reaches 350\u00b0F on a deep-fry thermometer. Adjust flame to maintain temperature. Working in batches, fry the meatballs, turning frequently, until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes total. Transfer the meatballs to a large platter lined with paper towels and season with salt. Serve the meatballs with lemon wedges, or with grainy stone-ground mustard.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBar Bites: Pork Schnitzel Meatballs\nSerious Entertaining: A Bavarian-Style Alpine Feast\nSnacks & Appetizers\nPork\nMeatballs"
