Heat 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add chiles and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Immediately add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until rice is pale brown, toasted, and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Heat another 1/2 tablespoon oil until smoking, add remaining rice, and cook, stirring, until it has the same texture as the first batch. Return first batch of rice to wok and toss to combine.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nPush rice to side of wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Break egg into oil and season with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss egg and rice together.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nAdd crabmeat, scallions, and fish sauce. Toss to combine and cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until crab is heated through and scallions are lightly softened, about 1 minute. Season to taste with white pepper and salt. Stir in cilantro.\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\nServe immediately with sliced cucumber, lime wedges, additional fish sauce, and sliced Thai chiles at the table.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok\nNotes\nFor best results, use jasmine rice. Chinese medium-grain rice or Japanese sushi rice can also be used. Rice should either be cooked fresh, spread on a tray, and allowed to cool for 5 minutes, or, alternatively, transferred to a loosely covered container and refrigerated for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days.\nRead More\nEasy Fried Rice Recipe\nFried Rice Recipes for Inspired Weeknight Meals\nThai\nSeafood Stir-Fry\nWhite Rice\nCrab\nRice & Grain Mains",
