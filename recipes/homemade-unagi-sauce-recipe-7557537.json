  "full_text": "Unagi No Tare (Homemade Eel Sauce)\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n25 mins\nCooling\n25 mins\nTotal\n50 mins\nMakes\n1 1/4 cups\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\n(\n240\nml\n)\nbasic dashi\n(see note)\n1/2\ncup\n(\n120\nml\n)\nmirin\n1/2\ncup\n(\n120\nml\n)\nsake\n1\ncup\n(\n7\nounces\n/\n207\ng\n)\ngranulated sugar\n(see note)\n120\nml\nlight soy sauce\nDirections\nIn a 3-quart saucier or saucepan, whisk dashi, mirin, sake, sugar, and soy sauce until combined and sugar is dispersed. Bring mixture to boil over high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble and froth, about 10 minutes. Adjust heat as necessary to ensure that mixture continues to boil but doesn\u2019t boil over.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nContinue cooking mixture, stirring occasionally, until bubbling slows and mixture has reduced by more than half and registers 235\u00b0F (113\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes longer (f you prefer a thicker sauce, you can cook it to 240\u00b0F/115\u00b0C); sauce will seem a little runny at first but will thicken as it cools. Transfer sauce to a heatproof bowl and let cool to room temperature. Use immediately as desired or store in refrigerator for up to one month.\nSerious Eats / Amanda Suarez\nSpecial Equipment\n3-quart saucier\nNotes\nIf you do not want to make homemade dashi, you can substitute powdered instant dashi: Dissolve 1 teaspoon instant dashi in 1 cup of water. If you prefer a more \u201ctoasted\u201d flavor, you can substitute brown muscovado sugar (kokut\u014d) for white sugar.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe finished unagi sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one month.\nCondiments & Sauces\nThe Latest\nJapanese",
