Add water and stir until mixture is well-combined and salt is dissolved, about 30 seconds.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nCover container with lid and set aside to ferment at room temperature until koji mixture is thickened and smells sweet and funky, at least 7 days or up to 10; stir mixture once per day throughout this fermentation process. Once shio koji is fermented, transfer to refrigerator until ready to use. Shio koji can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 10 months.\nNotes\nRice koji can be found in some well-stocked supermarkets as well as Japanese markets or online. Our favorite brand is\nCold Mountain\n, which can be purchased online\nhere\n. Prepared shio koji is also available for purchase, but it is often overly sweet and treated with alcohol to lengthen its shelf-life.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nOnce fermented, shio koji can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 10 months.\nRubs & Marinades\nJapanese",
