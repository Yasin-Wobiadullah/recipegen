If using chicken breasts, slice each breast so that they are of equal thickness. Heat broth in medium saucepan over medium-high heat to simmer. Add chicken and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to low and gently simmer until chicken is cooked to 160\u00b0F, 13 to 15 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate and when cool enough to handle shred into bite size pieces.\nIn large oven-proof nonstick skillet, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add onion, broccoli, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are just beginning to soften (but not cooked completely), about 6 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, remaining tablespoon oil, and tomatoes. Remove from heat and layer chicken into pan.\nWhisk 1/2 teaspoon salt and basil into eggs and pour into pan without stirring. Place dollops of ricotta into pan. Bake until eggs are just set, about 20 minutes. Let rest briefly before cutting and serving.\nSpecial equipment\n10 or 12-inch nonstick oven-proof skillet\nNotes\nMake this meal faster by using pre-cooked chicken; thigh meat will yield the moistest texture. Feel free to substitute your favorite vegetable for the broccoli. This frittata releases easiest from a non-stick ovenproof pan, but a regular pan can be used in a pinch.\nFrittatas\nChicken\nBaked Eggs"
