Seal and shake well to combine. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.\nMeanwhile, heat 1 inch of oil in a cast iron skillet to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Working in batches of 2 to 4 at a time, fry wonton wrapper halves until lightly golden, flipping once during frying; adjust heat to maintain oil temperature. Using a wire strainer or slotted spoon, transfer fried wontons to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with salt while still hot. When oil has cooled, pour off all but 1 tablespoon.\nReturn skillet to medium heat and add kimchi. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer kimchi to a plate and set aside.\nReturn skillet to high heat. Drain marinated beef and cook, stirring occasionally and working in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, until well browned, about 4 minutes; add oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, if skillet becomes too dry. Transfer beef to a plate, let skillet cool, and wipe out any excess oil.\nStir 2 tablespoons gochujang into cheese sauce and keep warm.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0F). Using the cast iron skillet as a vessel, assemble the nachos in layers in the following order: wonton chips, beef, kimchi, cheese sauce, and shredded cheese, repeating as you go until the ingredients are used up. You may have some leftover wonton chips.\nBake until shredded cheese is melted and nachos are warmed through, about 5 minutes.\nWhile nachos bake, mix together sour cream and lime juice. Drizzle baked nachos with lime sour cream and additional gochujang. Top with sesame seeds, cilantro leaves, scallion, and chile pepper slices, if desired. Serve immediately.\nSpecial equipment\nCast iron skillet, instant-read thermometer\nNotes\nGochujang is a Korean chili paste and can be found in Asian groceries and the international section of well-stocked supermarkets.\nThis Recipe Appears In\nOne-Skillet Korean Nachos Will Shake Up Your Party Menu\nNachos\nKorean\nFrying\nRibeyes",
