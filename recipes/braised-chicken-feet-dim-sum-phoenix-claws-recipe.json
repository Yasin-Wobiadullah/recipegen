Stir until the salt has dissolve. Set aside.\nFor the Chicken Feet:\nUsing kitchen shears, snip the nails off the chicken feet. Place chicken feet in a large bowl, add 1 tablespoon of salt, rub the salt and the feet together, and snip off any yellow spots or patches on the feet. Rinse the chicken under running water, drain, and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Try to get the chicken feet as dry as possible in order to minimize oil splattering when frying.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or wok to 350\u00b0F. When the oil is hot, hold the pot lid with one hand while using long tongs or long chopsticks in the other hand to carefully add a few chicken feet to the oil. Slightly cover the pot with the lid, leaving a small gap on top. Work in batches and do not overcrowd the pot with too many chicken feet. Fry until the oil stops splattering and the chicken feet are golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken feet to a paper towel-lined bowl to drain. Continue until all the chicken feet are cooked.\nWhen the chicken feet are all fried, transfer to container with brine. Add 1/2 cup of Shaoxing wine and 1 quart of cold water and stir to combine. Refrigerate for 2 hours. After 2 hours, remove chicken feet and drain in a colander. Discard brine.\nFor the Braising Liquid:\nCombine chicken stock, 1/2 cup of Shaoxing wine, 2 scallions, 2 slices of ginger, and 2 whole star anise pods to a large Dutch oven and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the chicken feet, reduce to a bare simmer, cover partially, and cook until chicken feet are fully tender, about 2 hours.\nFor the Sauce:\nWhen chicken feet are cooked, remove carefully with a slotted spoon and drain in a colander. Reserve 1 cup of the braising liquid. Discard remaining broth and return pot to stove. In the pot, add vegetable oil, 1 long hot pepper, 1 tablespoon of garlic, and 2 tablespoon of fermented black beans. Cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add reserved braising liquid, 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of soy sauce. Bring the pot to a boil. In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoon of water and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. Mix well with a fork, whisk into the pot, then add the chicken feet. Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce has thickened and clings to the chicken feet, about 10 minutes.\nServe immediately or save for later. If serving it later, transfer chicken feet with the sauce to a steam proof plate. Let it cool, cover, and store in the refrigerator. To reheat it, set up your steamer, and steam the chicken feet with the plate until heated through, about 10 minutes.\nSpecial Equipment\nSteamer\nThis Recipe Appears In\nDim Sum Classics: Braised Chicken Feet (Phoenix Claws)\nHow to Throw a Dim Sum Party at Home\nSnacks & Appetizers\nChinese\nBraised & Stewed Chicken\nChicken Feet"
