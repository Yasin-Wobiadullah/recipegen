Cut stem from pumpkin and slice pumpkin in half. Scoop and remove seeds. Place cut side down on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.\nRoast pumpkin until easily pierced with a fork near the stem end, 45 minutes to an hour. Remove from oven, set aside until cool enough to handle, then scoop out flesh with a spoon, discarding skin.\nAdd pumpkin flesh to a glass or plastic container. Add sugar, vinegar, ginger, and cinnamon. Stir to combine. Place in refrigerator overnight or for up to 24 hours.\nPass pumpkin mixture through a food mill or sieve, pressing the liquid into a bowl. Mostly, you're trying to capture the liquid, a combination of pumpkin juice and vinegar, but don't worry if a little of the pumpkin puree passes through the sieve. Discard the remaining solids. Return liquid to a jar and refrigerate. Shrub will keep for several months in the refrigerator.\nSpecial Equipment\nBaking sheet, resealable jar\nNon-Alcoholic Drinks\nPumpkin"
