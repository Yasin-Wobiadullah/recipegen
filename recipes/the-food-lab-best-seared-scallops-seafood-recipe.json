  "full_text": "The Best Seared Scallops Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n5 mins\nCook\n5 mins\nActive\n25 mins\nChilling Time\n15 mins\nTotal\n25 mins\nServes\n4 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n1 1/4\npounds\nfresh dry sea scallops\n(see note)\nKosher salt\n1\ntablespoon\nvegetable, canola, or\ngrapeseed oil\nDirections\nPlace scallops on a layer of paper towels and season with salt on all sides. Top with more towels and thoroughly pat dry. Let rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Remove and pat dry again. Season lightly with more salt. Heat vegetable oil in a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add scallops, leaving space between each one to prevent excess steaming.\nCook scallops without moving them until well browned on first side, about 1 minute. Carefully flip scallops and cook until second side is browned, about 1 minute longer. Transfer scallops to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to drain. Serve immediately.\nNotes\nDry scallops are fresh scallops that have not been chemically treated to retain moisture. Look for scallops that have a fleshy, translucent white or pale tan color. Avoid wet scallops, which are pale, milky white and often sitting in a pool of milky liquid.\nIf the scallop \"feet\" (the small, hard muscles attached to the main bodies) are attached, they should be removed and discarded before cooking.\nScallops\nStovetop Seafood\nSeafood Mains",
