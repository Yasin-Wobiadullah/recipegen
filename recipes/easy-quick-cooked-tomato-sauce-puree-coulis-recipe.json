Bring to a simmer, then lower heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until much of the excess liquid has cooked off but the tomatoes aren't totally dry, about 15 minutes.\nTransfer tomatoes and any juices to a vegetable strainer, a fine-mesh strainer, or a food mill set with the finest strainer. Strain the tomatoes of seeds and skin, pushing all the pulp and juices through; if straining by hand, use a wooden spoon and a scraping motion to pass the tomato flesh through into a bowl below. For an even smoother texture, pass the coulis once more through an even finer strainer.\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nSeason with salt.
