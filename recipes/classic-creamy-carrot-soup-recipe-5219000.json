Cover and refrigerate.\nDebbie Wee\nFor the Carrot Soup:\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). On a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, toss half of the carrots (1 1/4 pounds) with 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil; season with salt. Roast, stirring halfway through, until carrots are tender and deep golden brown in spots, about 25 minutes. Set aside.\nDebbie Wee\nIn a large Dutch oven or pot, heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add leek, onion, and garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 7 to 10 minutes.\nDebbie Wee\nAdd remaining carrots along with the roasted carrots, parsley sprigs, vegetable stock, and carrot juice. Season lightly with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower to maintain a steady simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the carrots are completely tender, about 25 minutes. Discard parsley.\nDebbie Wee\nLadle half of liquid and solid ingredients into a blender jar and add half of the butter (1 ounce; 2 tablespoons). Remove the blender lid plug (this will allow steam pressure to escape), close lid, and set a folded clean dish towel on top to cover the hole in the blender lid (keep your hand on the towel to hold it in place). Starting at the lowest speed and gradually increasing to the highest, blend the soup until it is completely smooth. Transfer soup to a large pot (if an even smoother texture is desired, pass soup base through a fine-mesh strainer into the pot). Repeat with remaining soup and butter. If soup is too thick, thin as needed with additional vegetable stock or carrot juice to desired consistency (the consistency should not be a thick pur\u00e9e, but rather a silky, creamy, soup-like one).\u00a0 Whisk in lemon juice and season to taste with salt.\nDebbie Wee\nDivide soup among warmed bowls and drizzle with lemon-herb yogurt.\nDebbie Wee\nSpecial Equipment\nRimmed baking sheet, Dutch oven, blender, fine mesh strainer\nNotes\nCarrot juice can be found in most grocery stores, refrigerated in the produce section. Look for 100% pure carrot juice.\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe soup can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months. The lemon herb yogurt can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\nCarrots",
