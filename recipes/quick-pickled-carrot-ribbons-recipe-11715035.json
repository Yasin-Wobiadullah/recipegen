Alternatively, use a mandolin to shave the carrots. Once carrot can no longer be peeled, thinly slice any remaining carrot. In a large bowl, toss carrots and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Chill, uncovered, for 30 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Stacy Allen\nWhile carrots sit, a medium saucepan, whisk together vinegar, sugar, water, garlic, bay leaf, ginger, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, and black peppercorns; cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until sugar and salt are dissolved and mixture is boiling, 2 to 5 minutes.\nSerious Eats / Stacy Allen\nWhen ready to pickle, place one 1-pint glass jar under hot running water until heated through, about 30 seconds; shake dry. Pat carrots dry using paper towels. Layer carrots and shallot into warmed glass jar. Set aside.\nSerious Eats / Stacy Allen\nPour hot vinegar mixture over carrot mixture in jar; place a piece of plastic wrap directly on surface to keep mixture submerged. Chill, uncovered, in refrigerator until flavors meld and carrot mixture is cooled, 1 1/2 hour. After 1 1/2 hours the carrots can be served or the jar can be tightly sealed and the pickles can be refrigerated for up to 1 month.\nSerious Eats / Stacy Allen\nSpecial Equipment\nY-peeler or microplane, medium saucepan, 1 (1-pint) glass jar with lid\nMake-Ahead and Storage\nThe pickled carrots can be refrigerated in a tightly sealed container for up to 1 month.\nCarrots\nThe Latest\nRecipes\nCondiments & Sauces\nPickling"
