  "full_text": "Scrambled Brains Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nCook\n10 mins\nTotal\n10 mins\nServes\n2 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n8\nounces\nbrains\n(\nlamb's\n,\ncalf's\n, or\npig's\n) soaked in changes of water and drained\n6\neggs\n3\ntablespoons\nbutter\nSalt\nand\npepper\nto taste\nHerbs, such as\nsage\n, to garnish\nDirections\nPlace a stainless steel skillet over high heat and wait until it's very hot but not smoking. Melt butter in the pan and place brains into pan. Let brains brown for a minute, then stir lobes around in the pan until they are browned but not cooked all the way through, about 2 minutes.\nAdd all eggs to the skillet and stir gently, taking care not to break up the brains more than necessary. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and fold in herbs after a minute. With constant and gentle stirring, the eggs will congeal around the brains in a minute.\nRemove scrambled brains and eggs from heat while eggs are still very soft and barely cooked through. The eggs will continue to cook on the plate. Serve hot, with more herbs to garnish.\nSpecial Equipment\nStainless steel skillet\nNotes\nYou'll want to soak the brains in water or briefly poach them in salted water before use. To soak the brains, wash them in cold water, then place them into a bowl and soak in several changes of cold water. Then pull off as much of the filament as you can without tearing into the brains.\nBeef Liver & Organ Meats\nStovetop\nScrambled Eggs"
