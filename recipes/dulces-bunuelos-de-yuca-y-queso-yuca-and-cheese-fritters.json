Variations exist from country to country, but the overall characteristics of the cheese are the same. This cheese can be found in the specialty cheese or Latin American dairy section of many supermarkets. Should you not be able to find queso duro, substitute haloumi, a Cypriot cheese made with goat's and/or sheep's milk.\nRead More\nVigor\u00f3n or Chicharr\u00f3n con Yucca (Yucca and Pork Rinds) Recipe\nFried Yuca with Spicy Mayo Recipe\nBu\u00f1uelos de Rodilla (Mexican Christmas Fritters) Recipe\nJamaican Banana Fritters Recipe\nCentral American\nMexican\nSouth American\nCaribbean\nCheese",
