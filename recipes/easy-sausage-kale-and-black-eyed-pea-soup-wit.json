Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are fully softened, about 1 hour.

Season soup to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately, drizzling with olive oil and sprinkling with remaining rosemary and lemon zest.\nSpecial Equipment\nBlender\nNotes\nCanned beans can be used in place of dried. To use canned beans, drain and rinse 1 (28-ounce) can of black eyed peas. Skip step 1 and add beans to soup in step 3, simmering for 30 minutes instead of 1 hour. Serve as directed.\nSoups\nStovetop\nBlack Eyed Peas\nSausages\nKale"
