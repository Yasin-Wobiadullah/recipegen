Sprinkle spice rub evenly on both sides of lamb ribs and set aside.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat and add oil or lamb fat. Saut\u00e9 onions until they're softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\nTo assemble the braise: Cover the bottom of your pan with saut\u00e9ed onions and apricots. Nestle rack of ribs into onions and apricots. Pour in enough water so that the ribs are 1/3 of the way submerged, about 2 cups. Cover the pan with foil.\nSerious Eats / Chichi Wang\nIn the meantime, preheat oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). Braise ribs in oven until very tender, about 3 hours. Uncover pan and turn heat to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Continue braising until the fat on the surface is browned and onions are very brown, about 30 minutes longer. Pour off rendered lamb fat in the pan, setting it aside for another use.\nServe hot or warm. Leftovers may be reheated in a 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C) oven until warm, about 30 minutes.\nSpecial Equipment\n10-inch\nskillet\n,\ncasserole dish\nNotes\nIf you do find yourself with a pool of rendered lamb fat in your roasting pan, consider collecting it for future use, in something like\nlight and fluffy biscuits\n, which I usually make with butter, but which are very good with lamb fat, lard, or tallow.\nLamb\nDairy-free Mains\nGluten-free Mains\nBraised & Stewed Lamb\nApricot"
