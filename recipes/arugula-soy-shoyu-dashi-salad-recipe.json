Set aside to cool slightly. If desired, peel and discard jackets. Cut into medium cubes and allow to cool to room temperature.\nMeanwhile, on a microwave-safe plate, drizzle walnuts with just enough olive oil to lightly coat, toss well, and arrange in a single even layer. Microwave in 1-minute intervals at high power, tossing walnuts between intervals, until toasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let cool.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine water with kombu and cook over medium heat until just shy of a simmer. Remove and discard kombu using tongs. Remove from heat, add bonito flakes, and let steep for 10 minutes. Strain dashi into a heatproof container through a fine-mesh strainer. Discard bonito flakes. (See note.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a small bowl, whisk 1/4 cup dashi together with soy sauce (this is now shoyu-dashi). Reserve remaining dashi for another use. (It's good just as a warming broth, or can be used to make a\nquick miso soup\n.)\nSerious Eats / Vicky Wasik\nIn a clean small bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons shoyu-dashi with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Reserve remaining shoyu-dashi for another use. (It's delicious as a broth for poached eggs, steamed fish, or simple steamed vegetables.)\nIn a salad bowl, combine sweet potato, walnuts, and arugula. Dress with shoyu-dashi/oil mixture, tossing well to coat. Season with salt and pepper and serve.\nSpecial Equipment\nFine-mesh strainer\nNotes\nKombu and bonito flakes can be saved and used to make a second, weaker dashi that forms a great base for\nmiso soup\n.\nRead More\nDashi 101: A Guide to the Umami-Rich Japanese Stock\nHow to Stock a Japanese Pantry\nPlumbing the Depths of Miso Soup\nQuick Salads\nWalnuts\nArugula\nSweet Potatoes\nQuick Sides"
