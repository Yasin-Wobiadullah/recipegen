Set aside for 15 minutes at room temperature.\nLay one spring roll wrapper down with a corner pointed towards you. Cover remaining wrappers with plastic or a moist clean kitchen towel. Add a half dozen carrot/daikon sticks, 1 cucumber stick, 1 jalape\u00f1o stick, and a few leaves/stems of cilantro in a bundle in the lower third of the wrapper, keeping it in a nice, tight row. Roll from the bottom corner towards the top, keeping everything nice and tight. Roll until nearly half way up, then stop.\nThe next step is to fold the left and right corners towards the center. Start by first pressing in on the edges of the filling with your fingertips to make sure it's packed nice and tight. Fold the corners towards the center, again keeping everything tight. Moistening the edges of the wrapper with a bit of water will help it stick to itself and keep its shape.You want the bottom edge to form a 90\u00b0 angle with the new edge you've just created by folding over the corner.\nAfter both corners have been folded in, continue rolling towards the top of the paper. Moisten the top corner of the wrapper with a bit of water and continue rolling until the entire package is sealed. Repeat with remaining rolls until all the filling is used up. Finished rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months in a sealed container. If freezing, fry directly from the freezer, adding 1 minute to cook time.\nTo Make The Sauce\n: Combine mayonnaise, chili garlic sauce, lime juice, and cilantro. Set aside. Sauce will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nTo Serve:\nHeat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 325\u00b0F as registered on an instant read thermometer. Add 10 to 15 rolls and cook, agitating occasionally with a wire mesh spider, until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately with spicy mayonnaise.\nNotes\nThis recipe calls for the smaller 5- by 5-inch spring roll wrappers which can be found in the frozen section of most East Asian markets. Egg roll wrappers can be substituted. If only larger wrappers are available, make larger rolls, or cut wrappers down to size.\nSpecial Equipment\nWok or Dutch Oven\nThis Recipe Appears In\nThe Vegan Experience Days 20 and 21: The Vegan Super Bowl Snack Challenge\nSnacks & Appetizers\nAsian\nVegan Snacks & Appetizers\nFrying\nGame Day"
