  "full_text": "Oat Crumble Crust Recipe\nClose\nJump to recipe\nPrep\n20 mins\nCook\n20 mins\nActive\n15 mins\nChilling Time\n30 mins\nTotal\n70 mins\nServes\n8 servings\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\nIngredients\n3\ncups\nrolled oats\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\n1/2\ncup\nall-purpose flour\n8\nounces\nbutter\n, softened\n1\ncup packed\nlight brown sugar\n3\ntablespoons\nmelted\nbutter\nDirections\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Combine rolled oats, salt, and flour in the bowl of a food processor. Grind the mixture until the oats are broken into small pieces, about 20 seconds. Set aside.\nCream 8 ounces butter and brown sugar in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or with an electric beater until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the dry ingredients and mix on low until blended.\nSpread the mixture in an even layer over a parchment lined sheet tray, stopping 1 inch before the edges. Bake for 10 minutes, rotating halfway through.\nAfter 10 minutes, remove the pan from the oven. Break up the mixture using a spatula, stirring it up so the golden brown exterior and the lighter interior are mixed. Re-spread the mixture evenly over the sheet tray, and return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the top is golden brown.\nAllow the pan to cool. Break up the crust into pieces and place them in the bowl of a food processor and process until homogeneous and mealy. Slowly pour 3 tablespoons of melted butter into the food processor through the top feeder tube as it's running. The mixture will feel slightly damp.\nPour the mixture into a pie plate and press the crust into shape on the edges and bottom. Chill for 20 minutes before filling.\nSpecial equipment\npie plate, food processor\nPie Dough"
